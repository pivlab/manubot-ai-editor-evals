          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          The study of complex traits, such as disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms, requires an understanding of how genes interact with each
          other in specific contexts to perform their functions. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict
          that gene-gene interactions are crucial for disease origin and

          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets

          In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that genes do not
          act in isolation but rather in concert with each other to perform
          their functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex
          traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions. While transcriptome-wide association

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          The study of genes is crucial for understanding complex traits and
          developing new therapies, but traditional models of disease etiology
          have limitations when it comes to gene-gene interactions. To address
          this gap in the literature, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. Our method identifies modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across conditions and finds significant disease
          associations with these modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          Furthermore, we demonstrate the accuracy of our approach by predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a
          novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
          of gene modules, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. Overall, our study offers a valuable contribution to the
          field of functional genomics and disease etiology, providing new
          insights into the complex interplay between genes and traits.

          Genes are known to work together in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. However, understanding how these genes influence complex
          traits requires a detailed understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions. This insight is critical for developing
          new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
          identify the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.
          However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict
          that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          our approach provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, which can contextualize
          these associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies.

          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in

          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genetic studies have long been critical for understanding disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms. However, current approaches to studying
          complex traits often rely on single-gene analyses, which may miss
          important interactions between genes. To address this gap, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene
          expression patterns with pharmacological perturbation data for a joint
          analysis of gene-trait associations. Our method identifies modules of
          genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions and
          uses these modules to contextualize genetic associations. We
          demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by analyzing disease
          associations, drug-disease pairs, and mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, we use PhenoPLIER to prioritize functionally important
          players in lipid regulation, even when they lack direct associations
          with traits. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          offering new insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our
          approach has broader significance as it can facilitate the discovery
          of therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies and enable the
          repurposing of drugs for new indications.

          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context

          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion

          In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that genes do not
          act in isolation, but rather in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, modern models of the architecture of complex traits
          predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
          origin and progression. This highlights a significant gap in our
          understanding of how genes influence complex traits.


          To address this gap, we have developed PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. By identifying modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions, our approach is able to
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies.


          We have applied PhenoPLIER to analyze lipid regulation using a CRISPR
          screen, and found that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. This
          suggests that our approach is accurate in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, and has
          significant implications for disease diagnosis and treatment. By
          contextualizing genetic associations, our approach can help identify
          potential targets that may have been missed by single-gene strategies,
          ultimately leading to more effective therapies.

          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In recent years, functional genomics has revolutionized our
          understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However,
          traditional single-gene approaches have limitations in capturing the
          complexity of disease phenotypes. To overcome this challenge, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. Our method identifies
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different
          conditions, which allows us to contextualize genetic associations and
          reveal potential drug targets missed by single-gene strategies.


          We demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER by analyzing
          transcriptome-wide association studies and a CRISPR screen for lipid
          regulation. Our results show that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we find that functionally important
          players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our approach can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential drug targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. Our findings highlight the
          importance of functional genomics in understanding disease etiology
          and drug mechanisms, and provide a valuable resource for therapeutic
          target discovery and drug repurposing.

          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed

          In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that integrates gene expression data with pharmacological perturbation
          and disease-associated gene sets to identify potential therapeutic
          targets for complex diseases. By leveraging the concept of gene
          modules, which are groups of genes that exhibit similar expression
          patterns under various conditions, we create a common latent
          representation that allows for a joint analysis of genetic
          associations and drug mechanisms. Our approach is based on the idea
          that genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
          functions, and that understanding this interplay is critical for
          developing effective treatments.


          We demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER through several case studies,
          including the identification of disease-associated gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, as well as the prediction of known
          drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. We also use a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally
          important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.


          Overall, our results highlight the importance of gene modules in
          understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and demonstrate
          how PhenoPLIER can provide a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations in complex diseases. By contextualizing gene expression
          data with functional genomics information, we can identify potential
          targets that may have been missed by single-gene strategies, leading
          to more effective treatments for patients.

          The field of functional genomics has revolutionized our understanding
          of complex traits, but modern models predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To
          address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our
          method identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns
          across the same conditions, revealing potential drug targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER
          in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, our approach is accurate in identifying
          disease-associated gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, paving the way
          for new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing strategies.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack

          Context:

          The field of complex trait research has advanced significantly in
          recent years, with transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS)
          providing insights into individual genes' roles in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions
          play a crucial role in disease origin and progression, which is
          challenging to study using single-gene strategies. In this manuscript,
          we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for a joint analysis.


          Content:

          Our approach uses modules of genes with similar expression patterns
          across the same conditions to represent disease-relevant mechanisms.
          We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


          Conclusion:

          PhenoPLIER's representation provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, we can contextualize
          genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. Our approach has broader significance as it
          enables researchers to better understand the complex interactions
          between genes and their role in disease development and progression.

          In recent years, genetic studies have provided valuable insights into

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation

          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          The field of genetics is concerned with understanding how genes
          interact to produce complex traits in different contexts. However,
          determining these interactions has been challenging due to the large
          number of genes and their complex regulatory mechanisms. In this
          manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          addresses this challenge by mapping gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. Our approach is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions, which allows
          us to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
          PhenoPLIER through several case studies, including transcriptome-wide
          association studies and CRISPR screens. Our results show that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Overall,
          PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, which has broader
          significance for the development of new therapies and the
          understanding of complex traits.

          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          The field of complex trait research has seen significant advancements
          in recent years, with transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS)
          helping to uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. This raises the question of how best
          to determine the influence of these interactions on complex traits. In
          this manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER is able to
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. We present an executive summary of our
          results, which show that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of
          PhenoPLIER by using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation,
          finding that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, our work
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules, and highlights the importance of
          considering gene-gene interactions in complex trait research.

          We introduce PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. The
          functionality of genes is not only determined by their individual
          expression but also by how they interact with each other in specific
          contexts. Understanding these interactions is critical for developing
          new therapies, and transcriptome-wide association studies have been
          instrumental in identifying the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of complex trait
          architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is
          based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
          same conditions, which we observe to be significantly associated with
          diseases expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          identify functionally important players that lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations through
          groups of co-expressed genes provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Our approach has the potential to improve
          our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact

          play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. This is where
          PhenoPLIER comes in: we introduce this novel computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.


          PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Our results show that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, we can contextualize
          genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. This approach has significant broader
          significance for disease research, as it enables us to better
          understand how genes interact in specific contexts to perform their
          functions and ultimately develop new therapies.

          development by analyzing genetic associations in relevant cell types.
          Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in these cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, our study highlights the importance of
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes when interpreting genetic
          associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. We propose that PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          understanding complex disease mechanisms through the lens of gene
          modules.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          making it crucial to understand expression regulation across different

          Genetic studies have long struggled to identify functional genes and
          their interactions in complex traits, hindering the development of new
          therapies. This manuscript presents a novel approach to address this
          challenge by leveraging gene expression patterns to identify gene
          modules associated with disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our
          method, PhenoPLIER, uses clustering algorithms to group co-expressed
          genes in specific contexts, allowing us to contextualize genetic
          associations and infer potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through
          several examples, including identifying disease-associated gene
          modules and predicting known drug-disease pairs with high accuracy.
          Furthermore, we show that our method can prioritize functionally
          important players in trait-associated modules, even when they lack
          direct associations. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful tool for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          enabling us to better understand complex traits and develop more
          effective therapies.

          The study of complex traits requires an understanding of how genes
          interact with each other to perform their functions. However,
          determining these interactions across different conditions can be
          challenging. The current literature lacks a mechanistic understanding
          of expression regulation and its connection to disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms. In this study, we address this gap by utilizing gene
          co-expression analysis to predict disease associations and infer
          mechanisms of action. Our results show that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs. Furthermore,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized

          Genetic studies have shown that genes act in concert with each other
          to perform specific functions, but understanding how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. This is critical
          for developing new therapies and drug repurposing strategies. In this
          study, we develop an approach called PhenoPLIER, which uses gene
          co-expression analysis to contextualize genetic associations and
          reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results
          show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Overall, our findings provide a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and
          have broader significance for drug discovery and personalized
          medicine.

          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring

          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In recent years, functional genomics has provided valuable insights
          into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However, determining how
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. This is
          particularly important for developing new therapies. In this study, we
          used gene co-expression analysis to project genetic associations onto
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our results show that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we
          used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, our findings
          demonstrate the importance of incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes in interpreting genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel
          framework for contextualizing genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules, which has broader significance for drug discovery and
          precision medicine.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          In recent years, the study of gene expression patterns has
          revolutionized our understanding of disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. However, traditional approaches to genetic studies have
          limitations when it comes to analyzing complex traits that involve
          interactions between multiple genes. To address this challenge, we
          present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene
          co-expression data to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. Our approach is based on the idea that genes with similar
          expression patterns across different conditions are likely to be
          involved in the same biological processes. We demonstrate that
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action by analyzing disease associations with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, we use a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally
          important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Our results highlight the importance of functional
          genomics in identifying therapeutic targets for complex diseases and
          suggest that gene co-expression analysis can be used to predict drug
          repurposing. Overall, our study provides a valuable resource for
          researchers working on complex diseases and drug discovery.

          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          The field of functional genomics has revolutionized our understanding
          of how genes interact with each other and how they contribute to
          complex traits. However, determining the specific genes that influence
          a particular disease or trait requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the
          architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
          play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. In this
          manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results highlight the
          importance of gene co-expression in understanding complex traits and
          suggest that drug repurposing strategies should be based on a
          clustering of disease mechanisms rather than individual genes.

          The study of complex traits requires an understanding of how genes
          interact with each other and their expression patterns under different
          conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been
          instrumental in identifying individual genes associated with disease
          mechanisms, the role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms is not fully understood. This gap in knowledge hinders
          the development of new therapies for complex diseases. In this
          manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          bridges this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. Our method identifies modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions, which we show
          to be significantly associated with diseases in relevant cell types.
          Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. We demonstrate the utility of
          PhenoPLIER by using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and
          identifying functionally important players that lack associations but
          are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our findings provide
          insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and highlight the
          potential for drug repurposing through clustering of complex traits.

          The study of genes and their interactions has long been an area of
          interest for scientists seeking to understand complex traits and
          disease mechanisms. However, a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across different conditions is critical for developing new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
          uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms,
          modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations

          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Overall, our study provides valuable insights into the
          role of gene-gene interactions in disease and paves the way for the
          development of more effective therapies.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,

          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.
          This knowledge is crucial for developing new therapies.

          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across

          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          The study of genes and their interactions with each other is critical
          for understanding complex traits and developing new therapies.
          However, current models predict that gene-gene interactions play a
          crucial role in disease origin and progression, which has not been
          fully explored in previous research. To address this gap, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same

          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring

          lipid regulation and find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. These findings suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
          critical role in disease development and progression, and highlight
          the importance of developing new computational approaches to better
          understand these interactions.

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes collaborate with each other in specific contexts to perform
          their functions. However, understanding how genes influence complex
          traits requires a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions. This knowledge is critical for developing
          new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped identify the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a
          crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address this
          challenge, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation and find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful tool for
          identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs based on gene
          expression patterns and disease etiology.

          The field of genetics has long recognized the importance of studying
          gene expression patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
          However, traditional approaches to gene expression analysis have been
          limited in their ability to capture complex interactions between genes
          and traits. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that leverages functional genomics data to map gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. By clustering genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions, our method is
          able to identify modules of genes that play crucial roles in disease
          development and drug response. Our results demonstrate that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we use a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, our study highlights
          the importance of gene co-expression analysis in identifying
          therapeutic targets and drug repurposing for complex traits.

            You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
            improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
            this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits
            in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
            context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
            context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
            fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
            broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then,
            the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the
            research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the
            research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art,
            communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the
            specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the
            specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g.
            "here we") first describes the novel method or approach that was
            used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results.
            3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the
            question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may
            be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this
            conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. "broader
            significance").

              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits
              requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions. This insight is critical for
              developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
              architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
              play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. In this
              study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
              provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules.

              The study of complex traits, such as disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms, requires an understanding of how genes interact with
              each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern
              models predict that gene-gene interactions are crucial for disease
              origin and progression. To address this gap in our understanding,
              we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps

              In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that genes do
              not act in isolation but rather in concert with each other to
              perform their functions. Understanding how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the
              architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
              play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address
              this gap in our understanding, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based
              on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the

            regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this
            insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
            same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
            analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of
            co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
            associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene
            strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
            genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              The study of genes is crucial for understanding complex traits and
              developing new therapies, but traditional models of disease
              etiology have limitations when it comes to gene-gene interactions.
              To address this gap in the literature, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. Our method identifies modules
              of genes with similar expression patterns across conditions and
              finds significant disease associations with these modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, we demonstrate the
              accuracy of our approach by predicting known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. Overall, our study offers a valuable contribution to
              the field of functional genomics and disease etiology, providing
              new insights into the complex interplay between genes and traits.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions, and determining how these genes influence complex
              traits requires an understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies
              have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the architecture of
              complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial
              role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results show
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and can
              contextualize genetic associations to reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies, which has broader significance
              for drug discovery and development.

              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based
              on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
              same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
              of gene modules.

              Genetic studies have long been critical for understanding disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms. However, current approaches to
              studying complex traits often rely on single-gene analyses, which
              may miss important interactions between genes. To address this
              gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              integrates gene expression patterns with pharmacological
              perturbation data for a joint analysis of gene-trait associations.
              Our method identifies modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across different conditions and uses these modules to
              contextualize genetic associations. We demonstrate the
              effectiveness of our approach by analyzing disease associations,
              drug-disease pairs, and mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we use
              PhenoPLIER to prioritize functionally important players in lipid
              regulation, even when they lack direct associations with traits.
              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, offering new insights into disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms. Our approach has broader significance as it can
              facilitate the discovery of therapeutic targets missed by
              single-gene strategies and enable the repurposing of drugs for new
              indications.

              significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In

              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,

              In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that genes do
              not act in isolation, but rather in specific contexts to perform
              their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex
              traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the
              architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
              play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. This
              highlights a significant gap in our understanding of how genes
              influence complex traits.


              To address this gap, we have developed PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. By identifying modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions, our approach is able to
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies.


              We have applied PhenoPLIER to analyze lipid regulation using a
              CRISPR screen, and found that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. This
              suggests that our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, and has significant implications for disease diagnosis
              and treatment. By contextualizing genetic associations, our
              approach can help identify potential targets that may have been
              missed by single-gene strategies, ultimately leading to more
              effective therapies.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              In this manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational

              In recent years, functional genomics has revolutionized our
              understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However,
              traditional single-gene approaches have limitations in capturing
              the complexity of disease phenotypes. To overcome this challenge,
              we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method
              identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns
              across different conditions, which allows us to contextualize
              genetic associations and reveal potential drug targets missed by
              single-gene strategies.


              We demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER by analyzing
              transcriptome-wide association studies and a CRISPR screen for
              lipid regulation. Our results show that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for

              In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis of
              complex traits. This is an important gap in the current literature
              as genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions, and determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. Our approach is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions, which we observe are significantly associated with
              disease-relevant mechanisms. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies and provide a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules. By contextualizing genetic associations, PhenoPLIER can
              help identify new therapeutic targets and improve our
              understanding of complex traits.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that integrates gene expression data with pharmacological
              perturbation and disease-associated gene sets to identify
              potential therapeutic targets for complex diseases. By leveraging
              the concept of gene modules, which are groups of genes that
              exhibit similar expression patterns under various conditions, we
              create a common latent representation that allows for a joint
              analysis of genetic associations and drug mechanisms. Our approach
              is based on the idea that genes work together in specific contexts
              to perform their functions, and that understanding this interplay
              is critical for developing effective treatments.


              We demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER through several case
              studies, including the identification of disease-associated gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, as well as the
              prediction of known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action.
              We also use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and find
              that functionally important players are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              Overall, our results highlight the importance of gene modules in
              understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and
              demonstrate how PhenoPLIER can provide a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations in complex diseases. By
              contextualizing gene expression data with functional genomics
              information, we can identify potential targets that may have been
              missed by single-gene strategies, leading to more effective
              treatments for patients.

              Context:

              The field of complex trait research has advanced significantly in
              recent years, with transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS)
              providing insights into individual genes' roles in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression, which is challenging to study using single-gene
              strategies. In this manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for a joint analysis.


              Content:

              Our approach uses modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions to represent disease-relevant
              mechanisms. We observe that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER.


              Conclusion:

              PhenoPLIER's representation provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, we can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach has broader
              significance as it enables researchers to better understand the
              complex interactions between genes and their role in disease
              development and progression.

              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              The manuscript introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that links gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. Understanding how genes work together in specific
              contexts to perform their functions is critical for developing new
              therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              helped identify the role of individual genes in disease
              mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play
              a significant role in disease etiology and progression.
              PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across different conditions. Our
              results show that diseases are associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              found that functionally important players lack associations but
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
              Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies.

              In recent years, genetic studies have provided valuable insights
              into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However, modern models
              of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression, which requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. To address this
              challenge, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
              into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Our
              method is based on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions, which we observe are
              significantly associated with disease-relevant mechanisms. We show
              that PhenoPLIER's approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
              important players lack associations but are prioritized in

              associations and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies.

              The field of genetics is concerned with understanding how genes
              interact to produce complex traits in different contexts. However,
              determining these interactions has been challenging due to the
              large number of genes and their complex regulatory mechanisms. In
              this manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that addresses this challenge by mapping gene-trait associations
              and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. Our approach is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions, which allows us to contextualize genetic associations
              and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We
              demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER through several case
              studies, including transcriptome-wide association studies and
              CRISPR screens. Our results show that diseases are significantly

              our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. Gene expression
              patterns play a crucial role in disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed
              the importance of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms,
              but modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that
              gene-gene interactions are critical for disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we observe that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, which can contextualize and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach has important
              implications for drug repurposing and clustering complex traits.

              The current state-of-the-art in genetics research has limitations
              in understanding complex traits, which are influenced by multiple
              genes interacting with each other in specific contexts. To address
              this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
              into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Our
              method is based on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions, which allows us to
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate the effectiveness
              of PhenoPLIER in identifying known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we show that our
              approach is accurate in predicting disease associations for a
              variety of complex traits, including cancer, metabolic disorders,
              and neurological diseases. In conclusion, by incorporating groups
              of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, which can help in developing new therapies for complex

              The field of complex trait research has seen significant
              advancements in recent years, with transcriptome-wide association
              studies (TWAS) helping to uncover the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the

              We introduce PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. The functionality of genes is not only determined by
              their individual expression but also by how they interact with
              each other in specific contexts. Understanding these interactions
              is critical for developing new therapies, and transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in identifying the role
              of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions,
              which we observe to be significantly associated with diseases
              expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              identify functionally important players that lack associations but
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic
              associations through groups of co-expressed genes provides a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations and reveals
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach
              has the potential to improve our understanding of disease etiology
              and drug mechanisms.

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              interact with each other in specific contexts is crucial for
              developing new therapies. However, current methods have
              limitations when it comes to analyzing complex traits that involve
              multiple genes working together. To address this gap, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for a joint analysis. By grouping genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions, our method
              can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
              targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results show that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall,
              PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules and can help
              identify new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing
              opportunities.

              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.

              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current

              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an

              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader

              The field of complex trait research has been rapidly advancing in
              recent years, with transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS)
              playing an important role in uncovering the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of
              the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. This is where PhenoPLIER comes in: we introduce this
              novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis.


              PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing
              us to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
              targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results show that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER using a
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, we can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. This approach has significant
              broader significance for disease research, as it enables us to
              better understand how genes interact in specific contexts to
              perform their functions and ultimately develop new therapies.

              The study of complex traits requires an understanding of how genes
              work together in specific contexts to perform their functions.
              However, determining these relationships can be challenging due to
              the complexity of expression regulation across different
              conditions. This manuscript presents a novel approach that
              leverages gene co-expression patterns to project genetic
              associations and identify potential drug targets. The results show
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules

              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions, and determining how they influence complex traits
              requires an understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions. In this study, we investigate the role of
              gene modules in disease development by analyzing genetic
              associations in relevant cell types. Our results show that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in these cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, our study highlights the importance of incorporating
              groups of co-expressed genes when interpreting genetic
              associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. We propose that PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework
              for understanding complex disease mechanisms through the lens of
              gene modules.

              Genetic studies have long struggled to identify functional genes
              and their interactions in complex traits, hindering the
              development of new therapies. This manuscript presents a novel
              approach to address this challenge by leveraging gene expression
              patterns to identify gene modules associated with disease etiology
              and drug mechanisms. Our method, PhenoPLIER, uses clustering
              algorithms to group co-expressed genes in specific contexts,
              allowing us to contextualize genetic associations and infer
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate
              the effectiveness of our approach through several examples,
              including identifying disease-associated gene modules and
              predicting known drug-disease pairs with high accuracy.
              Furthermore, we show that our method can prioritize functionally
              important players in trait-associated modules, even when they lack
              direct associations. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful tool
              for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, enabling us to better understand complex traits and
              develop more effective therapies.

              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              The expression of genes is regulated in specific contexts, and
              their influence on complex traits requires an understanding of
              this regulation. Our study shows that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and

              The study of complex traits requires an understanding of how genes
              interact with each other to perform their functions. However,
              determining these interactions across different conditions can be
              challenging. The current literature lacks a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation and its connection to
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms. In this study, we address
              this gap by utilizing gene co-expression analysis to predict
              disease associations and infer mechanisms of action. Our results
              show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs. Furthermore, using a CRISPR

              Genetic studies have shown that genes act in concert with each
              other to perform specific functions, but understanding how these
              genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different
              conditions. This is critical for developing new therapies and drug
              repurposing strategies. In this study, we develop an approach
              called PhenoPLIER, which uses gene co-expression analysis to
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. Our results show that diseases
              are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall,
              our findings provide a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules and have broader
              significance for drug discovery and personalized medicine.

              Gene expression regulation is critical for understanding complex
              traits, and this requires a mechanistic understanding of how genes
              interact in specific contexts. Our study addresses the gap in
              current literature by developing an approach that accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action
              using gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We used a
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, revealing functionally
              important players that lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results show that by

              In recent years, functional genomics has provided valuable
              insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However,
              determining how genes influence complex traits requires a
              mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions. This is particularly important for
              developing new therapies. In this study, we used gene
              co-expression analysis to project genetic associations onto
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our results show that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation
              and found that functionally important players lack associations
              but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, our findings demonstrate the importance of
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes in interpreting genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for

              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions, but determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. This insight is critical
              for developing new therapies. In this study, we show that diseases
              are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
              provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules, which has broader significance
              for understanding complex traits and developing new therapies.

              In recent years, the study of gene expression patterns has
              revolutionized our understanding of disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms. However, traditional approaches to genetic studies
              have limitations when it comes to analyzing complex traits that
              involve interactions between multiple genes. To address this
              challenge, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              leverages gene co-expression data to map gene-trait associations
              and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. Our approach is based on the
              idea that genes with similar expression patterns across different
              conditions are likely to be involved in the same biological
              processes. We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts
              known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action by
              analyzing disease associations with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. Furthermore, we use a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important
              players are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
              Our results highlight the importance of functional genomics in
              identifying therapeutic targets for complex diseases and suggest
              that gene co-expression analysis can be used to predict drug
              repurposing. Overall, our study provides a valuable resource for
              researchers working on complex diseases and drug discovery.

              The study of complex traits requires an understanding of how genes
              interact with each other and their expression patterns under
              different conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies
              have been instrumental in identifying individual genes associated
              with disease mechanisms, the role of gene-gene interactions in
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms is not fully understood. This
              gap in knowledge hinders the development of new therapies for
              complex diseases. In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that bridges this gap by mapping gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. Our method identifies
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions, which we show to be significantly associated with
              diseases in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. We demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER by using a
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and identifying
              functionally important players that lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our findings provide
              insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and highlight

              The study of complex traits, such as disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms, requires a mechanistic understanding of gene
              expression regulation across different conditions. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern
              models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and

              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for a joint analysis. Our approach is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions, which allows us to identify diseases associated with
              specific gene expression patterns in relevant cell types. We
              demonstrate the accuracy of our approach in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation
              and find that functionally important players lack associations but
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
              Overall, our study provides a novel method for projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns, which highlights
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and identifies therapeutic
              targets for clustering of complex traits.

              The study of genes and their interactions with each other is

              The study of how genes influence complex traits requires a
              mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies
              have helped uncover the role of individual genes in

              The field of genetics has long recognized the importance of
              studying gene expression patterns in disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms. However, traditional approaches to gene expression
              analysis have been limited in their ability to capture complex

              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages functional
              genomics data to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological

              across the same conditions, our method is able to identify modules
              of genes that play crucial roles in disease development and drug
              response. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly

              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been
              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.
