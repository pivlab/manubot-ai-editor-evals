          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions,
          making determining how they influence complex traits crucial for
          developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover individual genes' roles in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, modern models of the architecture of complex traits
          predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease
          origin and progression. To address this challenge, we introduced
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We found that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lack
          associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Overall, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, revealing potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our work provides a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          Genetic studies have unveiled complex patterns in disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms, but understanding how these genes interact with each
          other remains elusive. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene expression patterns to common
          latent representations for joint analysis. Our method identifies
          modules of genes with similar expression profiles across different
          conditions and reveals the role of these modules in disease
          development and drug response. We demonstrate that disease-relevant
          genes are enriched in trait-associated modules, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, we apply PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen for lipid
          regulation and identify functionally important players that lack
          associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules. Our
          findings provide a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene expression patterns, which can
          inform new therapeutic strategies and drug repurposing efforts.

          In order to comprehend how genes function in concert with each other
          within specific contexts, understanding the regulation of expression
          patterns across various conditions is critical. This knowledge is
          essential for the development of new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
          identifying individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms,
          recent models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in disease etiology and progression. We present PhenoPLIER, a

          In recent years, our understanding of disease mechanisms has been
          revolutionized by advances in functional genomics and genome-wide
          association studies. However, while single-gene approaches have
          provided valuable insights into complex traits, they are limited by
          the fact that many genes act in concert with each other to produce
          specific outcomes. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that integrates gene expression data with
          pharmacological perturbation information to identify key players in
          disease pathways. Our method maps gene-trait associations and drug
          effects into a common latent space based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns under different conditions. Using this
          representation, we find that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of
          action. We further validate PhenoPLIER by using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation and finding that functionally important
          players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          which can help identify potential therapeutic targets and drug
          repurposing opportunities. By contextualizing genetic associations
          with groups of co-expressed genes, our method can uncover new insights
          into disease etiology and mechanisms that may have been missed by
          single-gene strategies.

          Genes collaborate with each other in specific contexts to execute
          their functions. Identifying how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation under
          various conditions. This insight is crucial for developing novel

          Complex traits are influenced by interactions between multiple genes,
          which makes determining their etiology and mechanisms challenging.
          While transcriptome-wide association studies have provided insights
          into individual gene roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, they do not
          capture the complex interplay of gene expression patterns across
          different conditions. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and

          The role of individual genes in complex traits has been elucidated

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          Genetic studies have long been essential in understanding disease
          mechanisms, but functional genomics has recently highlighted the
          importance of analyzing expression patterns to determine the role of
          genes in complex traits. The clustering of genes with similar
          expression patterns across different conditions has become a crucial
          aspect of disease etiology and drug mechanism analysis. In this study,
          we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on the
          identification of modules of genes with similar expression patterns
          across the same conditions. By using PhenoPLIER, we observed that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicted known
          drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action. Moreover, we
          applied PhenoPLIER to analyze lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen
          and found that functionally important players lack associations but
          were prioritized in trait-associated modules. Overall, PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules, which can help identify potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring

          We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with
          each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.
          Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for
          developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene
          expression data and pharmacological perturbation information to
          identify potential therapeutic targets and drug mechanisms. Gene
          expression patterns play an important role in complex traits, as genes
          work together in specific contexts to perform their functions. This
          necessitates a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on
          modules of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns in the same
          context. We demonstrate the accuracy and utility of our approach by
          observing significant associations between disease outcomes and gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, we use a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally
          important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER, even when they lack direct associations. These findings
          suggest that our approach can provide a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          and may be useful for drug repurposing and target discovery.

          Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) scheme:


          1. Context:

          The current literature on complex traits highlights that modern models
          predict the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology
          and progression, but transcriptome-wide association studies have
          focused on individual genes. Therefore, there is a need for
          computational approaches that can contextualize genetic associations
          through groups of co-expressed genes.


          1. Content:

          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. We
          identify modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
          same conditions and observe that diseases are significantly associated
          with these gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action, highlighting its potential to reveal targets missed by
          single-gene strategies.


          1. Conclusion:

          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          through groups of co-expressed genes, providing a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.
          This approach has the potential to identify new therapeutic targets
          and improve our understanding of disease etiology and progression.
          Future studies should incorporate PhenoPLIER in drug discovery
          pipelines to uncover drug repurposing opportunities and improve
          treatment outcomes.

          The manuscript describes the development and application of
          PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that uses gene expression patterns
          and pharmacological perturbation data to identify potential
          therapeutic targets and drug mechanisms for complex diseases. Genes do
          not function in isolation but interact with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. This requires an understanding of
          how genes influence complex traits through expression regulation
          across different conditions. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene
          interactions are crucial for disease origin and progression.
          PhenoPLIER's approach is based on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions. By analyzing diseases
          associated with these modules in relevant cell types, the authors
          found that their method accurately predicted known drug-disease pairs
          and inferred mechanisms of action. Moreover, they used a CRISPR screen
          to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important
          players were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER's framework provides a new way to interpret
          genetic associations through the context of gene modules, enabling
          researchers to identify potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies and gain insights into drug mechanisms for complex
          diseases. This work has significant implications for drug repurposing,
          clustering of complex traits, and therapeutic target identification in
          functional genomics studies.

          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal

          The field of genetics has made significant progress in recent years,
          but our understanding of complex traits remains limited due to the
          lack of insight into gene-gene interactions. Traditional approaches
          that focus on single genes have limitations in uncovering complex
          disease mechanisms and identifying potential therapeutic targets. To
          address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          maps gene expression patterns and pharmacological perturbation data to
          identify functional modules of co-expressed genes. Our method
          identifies significant associations between diseases and gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, providing accurate predictions of
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER by using a
          CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and finding that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a
          novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
          of gene modules, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. This approach has broader significance as it enables us to
          better understand complex disease mechanisms and identify new
          therapeutic targets.

          We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene
          expression patterns and pharmacological perturbation data to identify
          common latent representations for joint analysis of gene-trait
          associations. Gene expression is a complex process that involves
          multiple genes working together in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. To understand how these genes influence complex traits, we
          need to have a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have helped identify the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait
          architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is
          based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
          same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach

          strategies. Our approach provides a novel framework for interpreting

          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          The field of genetic studies has been advancing rapidly, with
          functional genomics providing insights into complex traits and disease
          mechanisms. However, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions
          are critical in disease origin and progression, highlighting the need
          for a more holistic approach to understanding how genes influence
          complex traits. This is where PhenoPLIER comes in. In this study, we

          We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for joint analysis. Genes work together
          in specific contexts to carry out their functions, making it critical
          to understand expression regulation across different conditions to
          identify genes' influence on complex traits. Transcriptome-wide
          association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models predict that gene-gene
          interactions are crucial in disease development and progression. Our
          method's representation is based on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, we use a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation and observe that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, our method
          contextualizes genetic associations by incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, providing a new framework for interpreting genetic
          findings through the lens of gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          The field of functional genomics has enabled the discovery of new
          therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities. However, there
          is still much to learn about how genes interact with each other in
          specific contexts, which can lead to unexpected outcomes. One approach
          for addressing this challenge is through gene co-expression analysis,
          which identifies groups of genes that express similarly under
          different conditions. In this manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          novel computational method for mapping gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for a joint analysis. By analyzing the expression patterns of these
          gene modules in specific cell types, we observed that diseases were
          significantly associated with relevant gene modules. We also found
          that our approach was accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs
          and inferring mechanisms of action. In addition, we used a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally
          important players lacked associations but were prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a
          novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
          of gene modules, which can aid in disease etiology and drug mechanism
          studies.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for joint analysis. Genes often act in
          concert to carry out their functions in specific contexts. Therefore,
          understanding the influence of these genes on complex traits requires
          a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across different
          conditions. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of this
          insight in developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have facilitated the identification of individual genes' roles
          in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
          complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions are
          crucial for disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We show that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, we apply PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen
          for lipid regulation and find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules. In
          conclusion, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. Our method provides a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules.

          Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
          their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

          Gene expression patterns play a crucial role in determining how genes
          interact with each other to influence complex traits. However,
          understanding these interactions requires a deeper insight into
          expression regulation across different contexts. Our study
          demonstrates the importance of this understanding in developing new
          therapies by showing that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach is highly
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation and find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the importance of contextualizing
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which can
          reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and
          drug mechanisms that can aid in disease etiology and drug repurposing
          efforts.

          Genetic studies have long been used to identify potential therapeutic
          targets, but understanding the context in which these genes act is
          critical to developing new treatments. Functional genomics and gene
          co-expression analyses can provide valuable insights into expression
          regulation across different conditions, helping us better understand
          how genes contribute to complex traits. However, current approaches
          are limited by their focus on single genes or modules, potentially
          overlooking important regulatory interactions that may be missed. In
          this study, we developed a new approach called PhenoPLIER to
          contextualize genetic associations through the analysis of gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate that
          diseases are significantly associated with these modules and that our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lack

          complex traits is essential for developing new therapies. In this
          study, we employed functional genomics and gene co-expression analysis
          to project genetic associations onto specific contexts. Our findings
          show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, our results
          demonstrate the importance of contextualizing genetic associations
          through gene modules and highlight the potential for drug repurposing
          and target discovery.

          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          Genetic studies have long been used to identify candidate genes
          associated with complex traits, but recent advances in functional
          genomics have shown that genes act in concert with each other to
          perform their functions in specific contexts. This highlights the
          importance of understanding expression regulation across different
          conditions for developing new therapies. In this study, we demonstrate
          how gene co-expression analysis can be used to identify
          disease-associated modules and predict drug repurposing outcomes. We
          also show that CRISPR screening can prioritize functionally important
          players missed by single-gene strategies. Our findings suggest that
          integrating groups of co-expressed genes through a framework like
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets for therapeutic interventions, thereby advancing our
          understanding of disease mechanisms and drug discovery.

          Our manuscript presents an innovative approach for studying complex
          traits by leveraging gene expression patterns to identify disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms. We used functional genomics techniques
          such as gene co-expression analysis to determine how genes collaborate
          in specific contexts, leading to improved therapeutic targets and drug
          repurposing. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly
          associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, making our approach highly accurate in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. We further used
          a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, showing that important
          players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, our study highlights the importance of
          contextualizing genetic associations through gene modules and provides
          a new framework for interpreting complex traits.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Context: The complex interplay between genes is critical to
          understanding their functions, particularly in the context of disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms. While functional genomics has shed light
          on this interplay, current approaches are limited in their ability to
          predict disease associations and identify potential therapeutic
          targets. A novel method is needed to contextualize genetic
          associations and reveal hidden patterns that may be missed by
          single-gene strategies.


          Content: We present a new approach called PhenoPLIER that leverages
          gene co-expression patterns to identify functional modules associated
          with complex traits. Using this approach, we analyzed lipid regulation
          in cell types implicated in various diseases and found that
          functionally important players were prioritized in trait-associated
          modules despite lacking direct associations. Additionally, we
          validated our approach by predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          identifying potential therapeutic targets. Our results demonstrate
          that PhenoPLIER can accurately contextualize genetic associations and
          reveal new insights into disease mechanisms.


          Conclusion: The ability to contextualize genetic associations through
          the lens of gene modules provides a novel framework for interpreting
          complex traits and identifying potential drug targets. PhenoPLIER has
          broader significance in accelerating drug discovery and developing
          personalized treatments for diseases that involve multiple genes
          working together.

          Genes play critical roles in specific cellular contexts to perform
          their functions. Understanding how genes interact with each other and
          regulate expression across different conditions is crucial for
          developing effective therapies. Our findings reveal that diseases are
          strongly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. In addition, we found that
          functionally important players do not necessarily have associations
          but can be prioritized in trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER.
          Our study demonstrates the importance of incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and uncover
          potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.
          Overall, our results provide a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

          The study of complex traits, such as diseases, requires an
          understanding of how genes work together in specific contexts to
          perform their functions. This knowledge is critical for developing new
          therapies that target specific genes and pathways. In this study, we
          address the gap in the current literature by proposing a novel method
          called PhenoPLIER that allows us to predict disease associations based
          on groups of co-expressed genes, rather than single genes. Our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and reveals
          potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. We
          also show that functionally important players can be prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, our findings
          demonstrate the power of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes
          into the analysis of genetic associations, providing a novel framework
          for interpreting complex traits and informing therapeutic strategies.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions,
          and understanding the expression regulation of these genes across
          different conditions is critical for identifying new therapeutic
          targets. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify
          individual genes associated with disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
          modern models of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
          play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address this
          challenge, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns
          across the same conditions. We show that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation and find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Overall, our work provides insights into the complex
          interactions between genes and disease mechanisms, and highlights the
          potential for drug repurposing.

          Genetic studies have provided valuable insights into the molecular
          mechanisms underlying disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However,
          traditional approaches to gene expression analysis often fail to
          capture complex interactions between genes, which are critical for
          understanding how traits are influenced by multiple genetic factors.
          In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that integrates transcriptome-wide association studies with
          pharmacological perturbation data to map gene-trait associations and
          drug mechanisms into a common latent representation. Our method uses
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant cell
          types and conditions to identify disease-relevant genes and drug
          targets. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, and show
          that it is also effective in identifying previously overlooked
          functional players in lipid regulation by prioritizing them within
          trait-associated modules. Overall, our work provides a novel framework
          for analyzing gene expression patterns in complex traits and
          highlights the importance of gene co-expression in disease etiology
          and drug discovery.

          disease etiology and drug mechanisms, highlighting potential

          Genes often act together to carry out their functions, and determining
          how they influence complex traits requires an understanding of
          expression regulation across different contexts. This insight is
          critical for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have been helpful in identifying individual genes
          associated with disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict
          that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology
          and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that combines gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, we
          used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that
          functionally important players lack associations but were prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results highlight the
          importance of gene co-expression and functional genomics in
          identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs for complex
          traits.

          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          The study of complex traits, such as diseases, requires an
          understanding of the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms that
          contribute to their development. However, existing models have
          limitations when it comes to capturing the role of gene-gene
          interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. In this
          manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
          addresses these challenges by mapping gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation.
          This method identifies modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions, which allows us to better
          understand how genes interact in specific contexts. We demonstrate
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that
          functionally important players lack associations but were prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings provide
          insights into the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms of
          complex traits, which may lead to new therapeutic targets and drug
          repurposing strategies.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
          their functions, and determining how these genes influence complex
          traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions. However, modern models of the
          architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
          play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. The current
          research aims to fill this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. The
          results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate
          in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation,
          we find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, this
          research contributes to the development of new therapeutic targets and
          drug repurposing strategies for complex traits, thereby advancing our
          understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions.
          To understand how genes influence complex traits, a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions is
          crucial. This knowledge has proven vital for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify the role
          of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are essential in disease initiation and progression.
          Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that combines

          common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach is
          based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the

          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and that our method
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          The study of disease etiology and drug mechanisms is essential for the
          development of novel therapeutic strategies. The current models of
          complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in disease origin and progression. However, determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, there is a need for a
          computational approach that can map gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common representation for
          joint analysis. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          method that does just that by mapping gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types into latent representations. Our results show that
          diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrate the
          importance of functionally important players lacking associations but
          being prioritized in trait-associated modules by using a CRISPR screen
          to analyze lipid regulation. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides valuable
          insights into the role of gene expression patterns in disease etiology
          and drug mechanisms, thereby filling an important gap in the current
          literature.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions, making determining how they influence complex traits
              crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide

              Genetic studies have unveiled complex patterns in disease etiology
              and drug mechanisms, but understanding how these genes interact
              with each other remains elusive. To address this gap, we introduce

            complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
            regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this
            insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
            same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
            analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of
            co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
            associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene
            strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
            genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              In order to comprehend how genes function in concert with each
              other within specific contexts, understanding the regulation of
              expression patterns across various conditions is critical. This
              knowledge is essential for the development of new therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
              identifying individual genes involved in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, recent models predict that gene-gene interactions play
              a crucial role in disease etiology and progression. We present
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. In addition,
              we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, where we find
              that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In

              In recent years, our understanding of disease mechanisms has been
              revolutionized by advances in functional genomics and genome-wide
              association studies. However, while single-gene approaches have
              provided valuable insights into complex traits, they are limited
              by the fact that many genes act in concert with each other to
              produce specific outcomes. To address this gap, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene
              expression data with pharmacological perturbation information to
              identify key players in disease pathways. Our method maps
              gene-trait associations and drug effects into a common latent
              space based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns
              under different conditions. Using this representation, we find
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action.
              We further validate PhenoPLIER by using a CRISPR screen to analyze
              lipid regulation and finding that functionally important players
              lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules.
              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, which can help identify potential therapeutic targets and
              drug repurposing opportunities. By contextualizing genetic
              associations with groups of co-expressed genes, our method can
              uncover new insights into disease etiology and mechanisms that may
              have been missed by single-gene strategies.

              Complex traits are influenced by interactions between multiple
              genes, which makes determining their etiology and mechanisms
              challenging. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              provided insights into individual gene roles in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, they do not capture the complex interplay of gene
              expression patterns across different conditions. To address this
              gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. Based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease

              Genetic studies have long been essential in understanding disease
              mechanisms, but functional genomics has recently highlighted the
              importance of analyzing expression patterns to determine the role
              of genes in complex traits. The clustering of genes with similar
              expression patterns across different conditions has become a
              crucial aspect of disease etiology and drug mechanism analysis. In
              this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
              into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method
              is based on the identification of modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. By using
              PhenoPLIER, we observed that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicted known drug-disease pairs and
              inferred mechanisms of action. Moreover, we applied PhenoPLIER to
              analyze lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen and found that
              functionally important players lack associations but were
              prioritized in trait-associated modules. Overall, PhenoPLIER

              through the lens of gene modules, which can help identify

              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper

              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel

              abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence
              structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should
              follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
              gene expression data and pharmacological perturbation information
              to identify potential therapeutic targets and drug mechanisms.
              Gene expression patterns play an important role in complex traits,
              as genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions. This necessitates a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. PhenoPLIER's
              representation is based on modules of genes that exhibit similar
              expression patterns in the same context. We demonstrate the
              accuracy and utility of our approach by observing significant
              associations between disease outcomes and gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. Furthermore, we use a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important
              players are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER,
              even when they lack direct associations. These findings suggest
              that our approach can provide a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, and may be
              useful for drug repurposing and target discovery.

              Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) scheme:


              1. Context:

              The current literature on complex traits highlights that modern
              models predict the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease
              etiology and progression, but transcriptome-wide association
              studies have focused on individual genes. Therefore, there is a
              need for computational approaches that can contextualize genetic
              associations through groups of co-expressed genes.


              1. Content:

              In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. We identify modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions and observe that diseases are
              significantly associated with these gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, highlighting
              its potential to reveal targets missed by single-gene strategies.


              1. Conclusion:

              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
              through groups of co-expressed genes, providing a novel framework
              for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules. This approach has the potential to identify new
              therapeutic targets and improve our understanding of disease
              etiology and progression. Future studies should incorporate
              PhenoPLIER in drug discovery pipelines to uncover drug repurposing
              opportunities and improve treatment outcomes.

              The manuscript describes the development and application of
              PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that uses gene expression
              patterns and pharmacological perturbation data to identify
              potential therapeutic targets and drug mechanisms for complex
              diseases. Genes do not function in isolation but interact with
              each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. This
              requires an understanding of how genes influence complex traits
              through expression regulation across different conditions. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern
              models predict that gene-gene interactions are crucial for disease
              origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's approach is based on modules
              of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. By analyzing diseases associated with these modules in
              relevant cell types, the authors found that their method
              accurately predicted known drug-disease pairs and inferred
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, they used a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important
              players were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's framework provides a new
              way to interpret genetic associations through the context of gene
              modules, enabling researchers to identify potential targets missed
              by single-gene strategies and gain insights into drug mechanisms
              for complex diseases. This work has significant implications for
              drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits, and therapeutic
              target identification in functional genomics studies.

              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic

              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              The field of genetics has made significant progress in recent
              years, but our understanding of complex traits remains limited due
              to the lack of insight into gene-gene interactions. Traditional
              approaches that focus on single genes have limitations in
              uncovering complex disease mechanisms and identifying potential
              therapeutic targets. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene expression patterns and
              pharmacological perturbation data to identify functional modules
              of co-expressed genes. Our method identifies significant
              associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, providing accurate predictions of known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER by using a
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and finding that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
              provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules, revealing potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. This approach has broader
              significance as it enables us to better understand complex disease
              mechanisms and identify new therapeutic targets.

              abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence
              structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should
              follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
              gene expression patterns and pharmacological perturbation data to
              identify common latent representations for joint analysis of
              gene-trait associations. Gene expression is a complex process that
              involves multiple genes working together in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. To understand how these genes influence
              complex traits, we need to have a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern
              models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and

              identify functionally important players that lack associations but
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In

              The field of genetic studies has been advancing rapidly, with
              functional genomics providing insights into complex traits and
              disease mechanisms. However, modern models predict that gene-gene
              interactions are critical in disease origin and progression,
              highlighting the need for a more holistic approach to
              understanding how genes influence complex traits. This is where
              PhenoPLIER comes in. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for a joint analysis. Our method identifies modules
              of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions, allowing us to contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We
              demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover,
              we find that functionally important players lack associations but

              providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

              the importance of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes in
              understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out
              their functions, making it critical to understand expression
              regulation across different conditions to identify genes'
              influence on complex traits. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have revealed the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models predict that
              gene-gene interactions are crucial in disease development and
              progression. Our method's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Moreover, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation and observe that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In summary, our method contextualizes genetic
              associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              providing a new framework for interpreting genetic findings
              through the lens of gene modules.

              The field of functional genomics has enabled the discovery of new
              therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities. However,
              there is still much to learn about how genes interact with each
              other in specific contexts, which can lead to unexpected outcomes.
              One approach for addressing this challenge is through gene
              co-expression analysis, which identifies groups of genes that
              express similarly under different conditions. In this manuscript,
              we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method for mapping
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. By analyzing
              the expression patterns of these gene modules in specific cell
              types, we observed that diseases were significantly associated
              with relevant gene modules. We also found that our approach was
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. In addition, we used a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important
              players lacked associations but were prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, PhenoPLIER
              provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules, which can aid in disease
              etiology and drug mechanism studies.

              distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader

              Therefore, understanding the influence of these genes on complex

              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

            We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
            gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
            common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in
            concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
            functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
            requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
            different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's
            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
            patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
            significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
            cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
            drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
            using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
            functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
            in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
            incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
            contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
            missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel

              Gene expression patterns play a crucial role in determining how
              genes interact with each other to influence complex traits.
              However, understanding these interactions requires a deeper
              insight into expression regulation across different contexts. Our
              study demonstrates the importance of this understanding in
              developing new therapies by showing that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. Our approach is highly accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover,
              we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These
              findings highlight the importance of contextualizing genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules, which can reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
              provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              and drug mechanisms that can aid in disease etiology and drug
              repurposing efforts.

              Genetic studies have long been used to identify potential
              therapeutic targets, but understanding the context in which these
              genes act is critical to developing new treatments. Functional
              genomics and gene co-expression analyses can provide valuable
              insights into expression regulation across different conditions,
              helping us better understand how genes contribute to complex
              traits. However, current approaches are limited by their focus on
              single genes or modules, potentially overlooking important
              regulatory interactions that may be missed. In this study, we
              developed a new approach called PhenoPLIER to contextualize
              genetic associations through the analysis of gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate that
              diseases are significantly associated with these modules and that
              our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important
              players lack associations but were prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
              of gene modules, potentially revealing new therapeutic targets and
              drug repurposing opportunities.

              Genetic studies have been at the forefront of disease etiology
              research, but understanding how genes work together to regulate
              complex traits is essential for developing new therapies. In this

              analysis to project genetic associations onto specific contexts.
              Our findings show that diseases are significantly associated with

              Genetic studies have long been used to identify candidate genes
              associated with complex traits, but recent advances in functional
              genomics have shown that genes act in concert with each other to
              perform their functions in specific contexts. This highlights the
              importance of understanding expression regulation across different
              conditions for developing new therapies. In this study, we
              demonstrate how gene co-expression analysis can be used to
              identify disease-associated modules and predict drug repurposing
              outcomes. We also show that CRISPR screening can prioritize
              functionally important players missed by single-gene strategies.
              Our findings suggest that integrating groups of co-expressed genes
              through a framework like PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets for therapeutic
              interventions, thereby advancing our understanding of disease
              mechanisms and drug discovery.

              Our manuscript presents an innovative approach for studying
              complex traits by leveraging gene expression patterns to identify
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms. We used functional genomics
              techniques such as gene co-expression analysis to determine how
              genes collaborate in specific contexts, leading to improved
              therapeutic targets and drug repurposing. Our results demonstrate
              that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, making our approach
              highly accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action. We further used a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, showing that important players lacking
              associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. Overall, our study highlights the importance of

              Context: The complex interplay between genes is critical to
              understanding their functions, particularly in the context of
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms. While functional genomics
              has shed light on this interplay, current approaches are limited
              in their ability to predict disease associations and identify
              potential therapeutic targets. A novel method is needed to
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal hidden patterns that
              may be missed by single-gene strategies.


              Content: We present a new approach called PhenoPLIER that
              leverages gene co-expression patterns to identify functional
              modules associated with complex traits. Using this approach, we
              analyzed lipid regulation in cell types implicated in various
              diseases and found that functionally important players were
              prioritized in trait-associated modules despite lacking direct
              associations. Additionally, we validated our approach by
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and identifying potential
              therapeutic targets. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can
              accurately contextualize genetic associations and reveal new
              insights into disease mechanisms.


              Conclusion: The ability to contextualize genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules provides a novel framework for
              interpreting complex traits and identifying potential drug
              targets. PhenoPLIER has broader significance in accelerating drug
              discovery and developing personalized treatments for diseases that
              involve multiple genes working together.

              Genes play critical roles in specific cellular contexts to perform
              their functions. Understanding how genes interact with each other
              and regulate expression across different conditions is crucial for
              developing effective therapies. Our findings reveal that diseases
              are strongly associated with specific gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. In addition,
              we found that functionally important players do not necessarily
              have associations but can be prioritized in trait-associated
              modules using PhenoPLIER. Our study demonstrates the importance of
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize
              genetic associations and uncover potential therapeutic targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. Overall, our results provide a
              novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the

              The study of complex traits, such as diseases, requires an
              understanding of how genes work together in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. This knowledge is critical for developing
              new therapies that target specific genes and pathways. In this
              study, we address the gap in the current literature by proposing a
              novel method called PhenoPLIER that allows us to predict disease
              associations based on groups of co-expressed genes, rather than
              single genes. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and reveals potential therapeutic targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. We also show that functionally important
              players can be prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate the power of
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into the analysis of
              genetic associations, providing a novel framework for interpreting
              complex traits and informing therapeutic strategies.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions, and understanding the expression regulation of these
              genes across different conditions is critical for identifying new
              therapeutic targets. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
              helped identify individual genes associated with disease-relevant
              mechanisms. However, modern models of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. To address this challenge, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This approach is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same

              Genetic studies have provided valuable insights into the molecular
              mechanisms underlying disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
              However, traditional approaches to gene expression analysis often
              fail to capture complex interactions between genes, which are
              critical for understanding how traits are influenced by multiple
              genetic factors. In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that integrates transcriptome-wide
              association studies with pharmacological perturbation data to map
              gene-trait associations and drug mechanisms into a common latent
              representation. Our method uses modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across relevant cell types and conditions to
              identify disease-relevant genes and drug targets. We demonstrate
              the accuracy of our approach in predicting known drug-disease
              pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, and show that it is also
              effective in identifying previously overlooked functional players
              in lipid regulation by prioritizing them within trait-associated
              modules. Overall, our work provides a novel framework for
              analyzing gene expression patterns in complex traits and
              highlights the importance of gene co-expression in disease
              etiology and drug discovery.

            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and

              Genetic studies have highlighted the importance of functional
              genomics in understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
              Gene co-expression patterns play a crucial role in complex traits,
              and gene-gene interactions are predicted to be essential for
              disease origin and progression. To address these challenges, we
              present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene
              expression data with pharmacological perturbation and trait
              associations. Our method uses modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across different conditions to map gene-trait
              associations and drug perturbations into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. We demonstrate the
              effectiveness of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease
              pairs, inferring mechanisms of action, and identifying functional
              players that lack associations but are prioritized within
              trait-associated modules. Our findings provide new insights into
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms, highlighting the potential
              of gene expression patterns for identifying therapeutic targets
              and drug repurposing.

              The study of complex traits, such as diseases, requires an
              understanding of the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms
              that contribute to their development. However, existing models
              have limitations when it comes to capturing the role of gene-gene
              interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. In this
              manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
              that addresses these challenges by mapping gene-trait associations
              and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation. This method identifies modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions, which
              allows us to better understand how genes interact in specific
              contexts. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and

            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
            the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
            to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to execute their
              functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex
              traits requires a mechanistic comprehension of expression
              regulation across different conditions. The development of new
              therapies is critical for this insight. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the architecture of
              complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial
              role in disease origin and progression. We present PhenoPLIER, a

              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. Our findings show that diseases are significantly

              to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated

              abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence
              structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should
              follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              different conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies
              have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, there is a need for a computational
              approach that can map gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common representation for joint analysis.
              Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that
              does just that by mapping gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types into latent representations. Our results show that diseases
              are significantly associated with these gene modules, and our
              approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrate the
              importance of functionally important players lacking associations
              but being prioritized in trait-associated modules by using a
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation. Overall, PhenoPLIER
              provides valuable insights into the role of gene expression
              patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, thereby filling
              an important gap in the current literature.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence
              structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should
              follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been
              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.
