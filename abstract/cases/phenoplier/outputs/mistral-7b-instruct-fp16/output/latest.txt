          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          The study of genes in specific contexts is crucial to understanding
          their role in complex traits and disease development. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
          identifying individual genes associated with diseases, recent research
          suggests that gene-gene interactions are critical for disease etiology
          and progression. In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. Our approach is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. We demonstrate this by using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, where we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings provide a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules, and highlight the importance of considering gene-gene
          interactions in disease mechanisms and drug development. Keywords:

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Genetic studies have been instrumental in understanding disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms. However, functional genomics techniques
          such as gene co-expression analysis have revealed that genes do not
          act in isolation but interact with each other to perform their
          functions. Understanding these interactions is critical for developing
          new therapies, as modern models of the architecture of complex traits
          predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
          origin and progression.


          To fill this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.


          Moreover, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and find
          that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings
          suggest that by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, highlighting
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our approach has broader
          significance as it can aid in the discovery of new therapeutic targets
          through gene repurposing and clustering of complex traits.

          In complex systems, genes work together in specific contexts to
          perform their functions. Understanding how these genes influence
          disease and drug mechanisms requires an understanding of expression
          regulation across various conditions. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have been effective in identifying the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, recent models predict
          that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and

          analysis. This approach is based on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions. We observed that
          diseases were significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach was accurate in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally,

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must

          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on

          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this

          The study of complex traits is challenging due to the involvement of
          multiple genes interacting in specific contexts. While previous
          studies have identified individual genes that contribute to disease
          mechanisms, it is increasingly recognized that gene-gene interactions
          play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. This highlights
          the need for new approaches that can capture these interactions and
          provide insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. In this
          study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that combines
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data to map
          gene modules in a common latent representation. Our analysis reveals
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. We further use
          a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a
          novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
          of gene modules, which can contextualize these associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach has
          broader significance as it can facilitate the discovery of therapeutic
          targets and drug repurposing in complex diseases.

          In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that genes do not
          act in isolation but rather in concert with one another to perform
          their functions. This highlights the importance of understanding how
          these genes regulate expression across different contexts to better
          understand complex traits. To this end, transcriptome-wide association
          studies have been instrumental in identifying individual genes that
          are associated with disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and progression.
          In response to this challenge, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that allows us to map gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent

          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, by using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lack
          associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, our approach provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and
          offers potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genetic studies have revolutionized our understanding of disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms. However, functional genomics approaches
          are often limited by the lack of a systematic understanding of gene
          expression patterns and their relationship to complex traits. To
          address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that utilizes gene co-expression analysis and pharmacological
          perturbation data to map disease associations onto a common latent
          representation. This representation is based on groups of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions and is capable
          of accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Our approach identifies functionally important
          players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.
          By incorporating gene expression patterns into genetic analysis,

          The function of genes is highly dependent on their interaction with
          other genes in specific contexts. Understanding how these interactions
          contribute to complex traits requires a comprehensive understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. This knowledge is
          crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have helped identify individual genes involved in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions play a critical role in disease etiology and progression.
          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen
          to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
          players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework
          for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
          modules, enabling the contextualization of genetic associations and
          the identification of potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies.

          In recent years, advances in functional genomics have provided new
          insights into the complex relationships between genes and disease
          mechanisms. However, traditional approaches to understanding these
          relationships are limited by a focus on individual genes and their
          associations with specific traits. In this study, we present
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene co-expression
          patterns to identify potential therapeutic targets and predict drug
          responses. By mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules
          of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions,
          we demonstrate the power of this approach in identifying
          disease-relevant genes and predicting known drug-disease pairs.
          Moreover, our results suggest that PhenoPLIER can provide new insights
          into the mechanisms underlying complex traits by contextualizing
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. Overall, our
          findings highlight the importance of a systems-level approach to
          understanding disease etiology and drug responses and provide a novel
          framework for identifying potential therapeutic targets and predicting
          drug effects.

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a shared latent representation. We demonstrate how genes
          function together in specific contexts to perform their roles,
          highlighting the importance of understanding expression regulation
          across different conditions for uncovering disease mechanisms and drug
          targets. While previous studies have used transcriptome-wide
          association studies to identify individual gene contributions to
          complex traits, our approach leverages groups of co-expressed genes to
          provide a more comprehensive analysis. Our results show that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, we demonstrate
          how functionally important players can be missed by single-gene
          analyses but are prioritized within trait-associated modules using a
          CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation. Overall, PhenoPLIER offers
          a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the
          lens of gene modules, providing valuable insights into disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms. Our study highlights the importance of
          integrating multiple sources of genomic data to gain a comprehensive
          understanding of complex traits.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Context: The current understanding of complex diseases such as cancer,
          neurodegenerative disorders, and cardiovascular disease is limited by
          our inability to understand how genes interact with each other across
          different conditions. While recent studies have shed light on the role
          of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across various contexts is
          critical for developing new therapies. In this study, we address this
          gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis.


          Content: Our method is based on identifying modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions, and we observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with these module-level
          gene-gene interactions. Using PhenoPLIER, we can accurately predict
          known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. In addition,
          we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by our method.


          Conclusion: PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules provides a novel framework for
          understanding complex diseases. Our method can reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies, and it has the potential to
          improve drug discovery and development. By incorporating gene
          co-expression patterns, PhenoPLIER enables us to identify mechanistic
          insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that integrates gene
          expression data and pharmacological perturbation data to identify
          potential therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities for
          complex diseases. Our approach leverages the concept of gene
          co-expression, where genes work together in specific contexts to
          perform their functions. We show that PhenoPLIER's representation
          based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          different conditions accurately predicts known drug-disease
          associations and identifies novel mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER in a CRISPR screen analysis
          of lipid regulation, where we prioritize functionally important
          players missed by single-gene strategies within trait-associated
          modules. Our findings highlight the importance of contextualizing

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          The field of functional genomics has revolutionized our understanding
          of complex diseases, but current methods struggle to account for
          gene-gene interactions that play a crucial role in disease development
          and progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene expression patterns and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          method allows us to determine how genes influence complex traits
          through their concerted action in specific contexts. By utilizing
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately
          predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Our
          approach is further validated through a CRISPR screen analysis of
          lipid regulation, which reveals functionally important players lacking
          associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          allowing us to contextualize these associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach has
          significant implications for drug repurposing and clustering of
          complex traits, ultimately paving the way for new therapeutic
          strategies.

          In this manuscript, we present a computational approach called
          PhenoPLIER that combines gene expression data and pharmacological
          perturbation information to create a common latent representation for
          joint analysis. Gene expression patterns are highly contextual and can
          be influenced by various factors. Therefore, determining how these
          genes contribute to complex traits requires a mechanistic
          understanding of their regulation across different conditions. Recent
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, modern models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions play an essential role in disease etiology
          and progression. PhenoPLIER's approach is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
          results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and
          found that functionally important players lack associations but were
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER's framework provides a novel way to contextualize genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, allowing us to identify
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          We present a new computational approach called PhenoPLIER, which
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. The gene
          expression patterns have been shown to play an essential role in the
          development of complex traits, and functional genomics has helped
          uncover their relevance in disease mechanisms. However, modern models
          suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial for disease origin and
          progression. Our approach is based on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across different conditions and observes that
          diseases are significantly associated with these modules expressed in
          relevant cell types. It also accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, we use a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally
          important players lacking associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This highlights the potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies and provides a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules.

          In recent years, there has been growing interest in the use of
          functional genomics to identify potential therapeutic targets for
          complex diseases. However, the current approach to disease etiology
          and drug mechanisms is limited by its focus on single-gene studies,
          which fail to account for gene-gene interactions that play a crucial
          role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we have
          developed PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. By leveraging modules of
          genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential

          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules. We demonstrate this by
          using PhenoPLIER to analyze lipid regulation in response to CRISPR
          screens, where we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER's representation provides a powerful tool for
          projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns and
          highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach has the
          potential to revolutionize our understanding of complex diseases and
          guide the development of new therapies.

          In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational tool
          designed to integrate gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation. The role of
          genes in complex traits cannot be fully understood without
          understanding how they are regulated under different conditions. This
          is crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have helped identify individual genes associated
          with disease mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a key role in disease etiology and progression.
          PhenoPLIER's representation is based on groups of genes with similar

          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. The field of functional
          genomics has shown that genes work together in specific contexts to
          perform their functions, and determining how these genes influence
          complex traits requires an understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions. Modern models of the architecture of
          complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role

          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and
          contextualizing genetic associations, thus revealing potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach can be applied to
          various complex traits, such as disease etiology and drug mechanisms,
          highlighting the importance of gene co-expression in understanding
          these processes.

          Gene expression patterns play a critical role in the development of
          complex traits and diseases. Functional genomics has provided valuable
          insights into this process, but identifying therapeutic targets and
          drug mechanisms remains challenging. Our study aimed to address these
          challenges by integrating gene co-expression data with genetic studies
          to identify disease etiology and potential drug targets. We developed
          a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which uses clustering of complex traits
          to identify relevant gene modules in specific cell types. Our results
          showed that diseases were significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicted
          known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and
          found that functionally important players lack associations but were
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, our
          study demonstrates the potential of gene modules as a
          contextualization tool for genetic associations, which could lead to
          the discovery of new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing
          strategies.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          The coordinated action of genes is essential in accomplishing their

          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader

          The study of genes in complex contexts is critical to understanding
          their functions, which can be used to develop new therapies for
          diseases. However, determining how these genes influence complex
          traits requires a deeper understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. This study shows that diseases are significantly

          Genetic studies have been conducted to determine how genes interact
          with each other in different contexts to perform their functions.
          However, the complexity of these interactions requires a deeper
          understanding of expression regulation across various conditions. Our
          study aims to provide a mechanistic approach for developing new
          therapies by analyzing gene modules expressed in relevant cell types
          and predicting known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. We
          used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, and our results show
          that functionally important players are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules, while lacking associations with single
          genes. In conclusion, our approach can contextualize genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, providing a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic data. This study highlights the
          importance of using functional genomics to identify therapeutic
          targets and repurpose drugs for complex traits.

          Genetic studies have traditionally focused on analyzing individual
          genes in isolation, but this approach fails to capture how genes
          interact with each other and contribute to complex traits. Functional
          genomics provides a way to investigate these interactions, allowing
          researchers to identify co-expressed genes and understand their roles
          in disease mechanisms. However, the vast amount of data generated by
          functional genomics studies makes it challenging to identify key
          players and therapeutic targets. Our manuscript presents an innovative
          approach that uses gene expression patterns to predict disease
          associations and drug repurposing. We utilized clustering algorithms
          to group co-expressed genes into modules and analyzed their roles in
          disease etiology. Our results show that diseases are significantly
          associated with specific gene modules, and our method accurately
          predicted known drug-disease pairs and identified potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. Additionally, we used a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally
          important players lack associations but were prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, our study provides a
          novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
          of gene modules, highlighting the importance of considering gene
          interactions in disease etiology and drug discovery.

          Genetic studies often focus on individual genes in isolation, but
          understanding how genes work together to influence complex traits is
          crucial for developing effective therapies. In this study, we explored
          gene expression patterns and their association with disease etiology
          and drug mechanisms using functional genomics approaches. We found
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicted known
          drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action. Additionally, we
          used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that
          functionally important players were prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER, even if they lacked direct associations. This
          suggests that by contextualizing genetic associations through groups
          of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies and provide a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations. Our findings highlight the
          importance of integrating functional genomics data with other types of
          genomic information to gain a more comprehensive understanding of
          complex traits and disease mechanisms, ultimately leading to the
          discovery of new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing
          opportunities.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on

          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that

          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)

          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader

          The study of genetic associations in complex traits is critical for
          developing new therapies, but it requires a mechanistic understanding
          of expression regulation across different conditions. Our results show
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known

          of gene modules, which has broader significance for drug repurposing,

          The present study aims to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying
          complex traits by analyzing gene expression patterns in specific
          contexts. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is highly accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. In addition, we used a CRISPR screen
          to investigate lipid regulation and found that functionally important
          players were not associated but prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. These results demonstrate the value of using
          groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and
          reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our novel
          framework, PhenoPLIER, provides a powerful tool for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, with
          applications in therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing.

          The study of genes and their interactions is central to understanding
          complex traits and disease mechanisms. However, determining how these
          genes work together in specific contexts remains a challenge. Our
          research addresses this gap by developing a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. We
          found that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene
          expression patterns in relevant cell types, and our approach

          missed by single-gene strategies. By incorporating groups of

          Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions
          and determining how they influence complex traits requires an

          The role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms has been
          uncovered through transcriptome-wide association studies. However,

          expression patterns in complex traits and their role in disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms. Our findings provide a valuable resource

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Genetic studies have provided valuable insights into the etiology and
          drug mechanisms of complex diseases. However, they often fail to
          capture the functional relationships between genes, making it
          challenging to identify potential therapeutic targets. Here we present
          a novel approach called PhenoPLIER that leverages gene co-expression
          patterns to project genetic associations onto gene expression data,
          thus highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.


          PhenoPLIER uses clustering algorithms to group genes with similar
          expression patterns across different conditions, thereby identifying
          modules of functionally related genes. We then map these gene modules
          onto disease-relevant transcriptome-wide association studies,
          pharmacological perturbation data, and CRISPR screens to identify the
          most relevant modules for each disease or trait.


          Our results show that PhenoPLIER can accurately predict known
          drug-disease pairs, infer mechanisms of action, and uncover novel
          potential therapeutic targets. For example, we found that genes
          involved in lipid regulation are not associated with any specific
          disease in traditional genetic studies but were highly prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


          Overall, our findings underscore the importance of gene co-expression
          patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanism discovery, and
          PhenoPLIER provides a valuable tool for identifying potential
          therapeutic targets through gene expression data analysis.

          The study examines how genes work together to perform their functions
          and the importance of understanding expression regulation across
          different conditions for developing new therapies. Although
          transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify individual
          gene involvement in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict
          that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression. The manuscript introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational
          method that combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Results show
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, the study finds
          that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. The findings
          highlight the importance of gene co-expression and clustering of
          complex traits for understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of

          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Gene expression patterns play a crucial role in the development and
          progression of complex traits such as diseases. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify individual
          genes associated with disease, there is a need for a more
          comprehensive understanding of gene-gene interactions. Here we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene
          expression data and pharmacological perturbation data into a common

          leverages modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          different conditions and reveals that diseases are significantly
          associated with these gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          Furthermore, we demonstrate the accuracy of our approach in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action,
          highlighting its potential for drug repurposing and target discovery.

          Gene expression patterns play an essential role in disease etiology
          and drug mechanisms. To uncover these relationships, we have developed
          a computational approach called PhenoPLIER that integrates gene-trait

          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. We
          further demonstrate this by using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation and finding that functionally important players lacking
          associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Overall, our
          study highlights the importance of gene co-expression analysis in
          understanding complex traits and identifying therapeutic targets for
          drug repurposing.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding gene expression
          patterns and their role in complex traits is crucial for developing
          new therapeutic targets. Recent transcriptome-wide association studies
          have provided insights into individual gene associations with
          disease-relevant mechanisms, but they have not fully captured the
          complexity of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          maps gene expression patterns and pharmacological perturbation data to
          identify common latent representations of gene modules that are
          associated with complex traits. Our results show that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs

          screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, PhenoPLIER highlights
          the importance of gene expression patterns and their role in complex
          traits, providing valuable insights for therapeutic target discovery
          and drug repurposing.

          known drug-disease pairs, and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, we show that our approach prioritizes functionally
          important players that lack direct associations but are present in
          trait-associated modules. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a valuable tool
          for uncovering the genetic architecture of complex traits and
          identifying potential therapeutic targets.

          Genetic studies and functional genomics have long been used to
          identify disease risk factors. However, the complexity of gene
          expression patterns across different conditions makes it challenging
          to determine how individual genes influence complex traits. This
          challenge is particularly relevant in the context of drug development,
          where a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation is critical
          for developing effective therapies.


          To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation. This representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action.


          Our results suggest that functional important players may lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. This finding highlights the importance of considering
          gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
          Overall, our approach provides a powerful tool for identifying
          therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs for new indications.

          Genetic studies have traditionally focused on individual genes and
          their association with disease outcomes, but recent advances in
          functional genomics suggest that gene co-expression patterns may
          provide valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
          The identification of key modules of differentially expressed genes
          across various conditions can help predict complex trait associations
          and identify novel therapeutic targets for drug repurposing. In this
          manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          integrates transcriptome-wide association studies with pharmacological
          perturbation data to map gene-trait associations into a common latent
          representation based on gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          By using PhenoPLIER, we were able to predict known drug-disease pairs
          and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we used a CRISPR screen
          to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important
          players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by our approach. Our findings highlight the importance of
          considering gene co-expression patterns in disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms, and provide a valuable tool for identifying new
          therapeutic targets through clustering of complex traits.

            the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular

              The study of genes in specific contexts is crucial to
              understanding their role in complex traits and disease
              development. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              been instrumental in identifying individual genes associated with
              diseases, recent research suggests that gene-gene interactions are
              critical for disease etiology and progression. In this manuscript,
              we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our approach is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions, allowing us to contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. We demonstrate this by using a CRISPR screen
              to analyze lipid regulation, where we find that functionally
              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings provide a
              novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the
              lens of gene modules, and highlight the importance of considering
              gene-gene interactions in disease mechanisms and drug development.

              Genetic studies have been instrumental in understanding disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms. However, functional genomics
              techniques such as gene co-expression analysis have revealed that
              genes do not act in isolation but interact with each other to
              perform their functions. Understanding these interactions is
              critical for developing new therapies, as modern models of the
              architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
              play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.


              To fill this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action.


              Moreover, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These
              findings suggest that by incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our
              approach has broader significance as it can aid in the discovery
              of new therapeutic targets through gene repurposing and clustering
              of complex traits.

              progression. This highlights the need for new approaches that can
              capture these interactions and provide insights into disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms. In this study, we present
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that combines gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data to map gene
              modules in a common latent representation. Our analysis reveals
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. We further use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation
              and find that functionally important players lack associations but
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules, which can
              contextualize these associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. This approach has broader
              significance as it can facilitate the discovery of therapeutic
              targets and drug repurposing in complex diseases.

              In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that genes do
              not act in isolation but rather in concert with one another to
              perform their functions. This highlights the importance of
              understanding how these genes regulate expression across different
              contexts to better understand complex traits. To this end,
              transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in

              Genetic studies have revolutionized our understanding of disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms. However, functional genomics
              approaches are often limited by the lack of a systematic
              understanding of gene expression patterns and their relationship
              to complex traits. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that utilizes gene co-expression analysis
              and pharmacological perturbation data to map disease associations
              onto a common latent representation. This representation is based
              on groups of genes with similar expression patterns across the
              same conditions and is capable of accurately predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Our
              approach identifies functionally important players that lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules,
              revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By

              PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting disease

              The function of genes is highly dependent on their interaction
              with other genes in specific contexts. Understanding how these
              interactions contribute to complex traits requires a comprehensive
              understanding of expression regulation across different
              conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing new
              therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have

              Genetic studies have long been important in understanding complex
              traits and disease mechanisms. However, recent advances in
              functional genomics have shown that gene-gene interactions play a
              crucial role in disease development and progression. The challenge
              is to identify these interactions and understand their impact on
              disease. We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across different conditions. Our results demonstrate that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. We also find
              that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our study
              provides a new framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules, which can inform therapeutic
              strategies and drug repurposing efforts.

              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights

              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their

              In recent years, advances in functional genomics have provided new
              insights into the complex relationships between genes and disease
              mechanisms. However, traditional approaches to understanding these
              relationships are limited by a focus on individual genes and their
              associations with specific traits. In this study, we present
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene
              co-expression patterns to identify potential therapeutic targets
              and predict drug responses. By mapping gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation based on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions, we demonstrate the power of
              this approach in identifying disease-relevant genes and predicting
              known drug-disease pairs. Moreover, our results suggest that
              PhenoPLIER can provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying
              complex traits by contextualizing genetic associations through the
              lens of gene modules. Overall, our findings highlight the
              importance of a systems-level approach to understanding disease
              etiology and drug responses and provide a novel framework for
              identifying potential therapeutic targets and predicting drug

              In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent representation. We
              demonstrate how genes function together in specific contexts to
              perform their roles, highlighting the importance of understanding
              expression regulation across different conditions for uncovering
              disease mechanisms and drug targets. While previous studies have
              used transcriptome-wide association studies to identify individual
              gene contributions to complex traits, our approach leverages
              groups of co-expressed genes to provide a more comprehensive
              analysis. Our results show that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, we demonstrate how
              functionally important players can be missed by single-gene
              analyses but are prioritized within trait-associated modules using
              a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation. Overall, PhenoPLIER
              offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules, providing valuable insights into
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our study highlights the
              importance of integrating multiple sources of genomic data to gain
              a comprehensive understanding of complex traits.

              abstract of this manuscript.


              Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              Context: The current understanding of complex diseases such as
              cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and cardiovascular disease is
              limited by our inability to understand how genes interact with
              each other across different conditions. While recent studies have
              shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across various contexts is critical for developing new therapies.
              In this study, we address this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for a joint analysis.


              Content: Our method is based on identifying modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions, and we
              observe that diseases are significantly associated with these
              module-level gene-gene interactions. Using PhenoPLIER, we can
              accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms
              of action. In addition, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation and find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              our method.


              Conclusion: PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules provides a novel
              framework for understanding complex diseases. Our method can
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, and it
              has the potential to improve drug discovery and development. By
              incorporating gene co-expression patterns, PhenoPLIER enables us
              to identify mechanistic insights into disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms.

              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that integrates gene
              expression data and pharmacological perturbation data to identify
              potential therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities
              for complex diseases. Our approach leverages the concept of gene
              co-expression, where genes work together in specific contexts to

              different conditions accurately predicts known drug-disease
              associations and identifies novel mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER in a CRISPR

              functionally important players missed by single-gene strategies
              within trait-associated modules. Our findings highlight the

              The field of functional genomics has revolutionized our
              understanding of complex diseases, but current methods struggle to
              account for gene-gene interactions that play a crucial role in
              disease development and progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene expression patterns and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for a joint analysis. This method allows us to
              determine how genes influence complex traits through their
              concerted action in specific contexts. By utilizing modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions,
              we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately
              predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action.
              Our approach is further validated through a CRISPR screen analysis
              of lipid regulation, which reveals functionally important players
              lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules

              This approach has significant implications for drug repurposing
              and clustering of complex traits, ultimately paving the way for
              new therapeutic strategies.

              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic

            We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps

            requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
            different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is

              In this manuscript, we present a computational approach called
              PhenoPLIER that combines gene expression data and pharmacological
              perturbation information to create a common latent representation
              for joint analysis. Gene expression patterns are highly contextual
              and can be influenced by various factors. Therefore, determining
              how these genes contribute to complex traits requires a
              mechanistic understanding of their regulation across different
              conditions. Recent transcriptome-wide association studies have
              shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms.
              However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play an
              essential role in disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER's
              approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions. Our results show that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that
              functionally important players lack associations but were
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER's framework provides a novel way to
              contextualize genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, allowing us to identify potential targets missed by
              single-gene strategies.

              The study presents PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational method
              that bridges the gap between gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data by mapping them into a shared
              latent representation for joint analysis. Genes collaborate to
              perform their functions in specific contexts, and determining how
              they influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding
              of expression regulation across different conditions. This
              knowledge is crucial for developing new therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have unveiled the role of
              individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of
              the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a vital role in disease origin and progression.
              PhenoPLIER's approach is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. The study finds
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation,
              the study reveals that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules, providing a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations and identifying
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              In recent years, there has been growing interest in the use of
              functional genomics to identify potential therapeutic targets for
              complex diseases. However, the current approach to disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms is limited by its focus on
              single-gene studies, which fail to account for gene-gene
              interactions that play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. To address this gap, we have developed PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. By leveraging modules of genes
              with similar expression patterns across different conditions,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach
              is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action, providing a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. We
              demonstrate this by using PhenoPLIER to analyze lipid regulation
              in response to CRISPR screens, where we find that functionally
              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's
              representation provides a powerful tool for projecting genetic

              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational tool
              designed to integrate gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation. The role
              of genes in complex traits cannot be fully understood without
              understanding how they are regulated under different conditions.
              This is crucial for developing new therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify
              individual genes associated with disease mechanisms, modern models
              predict that gene-gene interactions play a key role in disease
              etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on
              groups of genes with similar expression patterns across different
              conditions. Our analysis reveals that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. We also demonstrate the utility of
              PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation,
              where functionally important players lacking associations were
              prioritized in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, by
              considering groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a
              novel framework for contextualizing genetic associations and
              identifying potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

              Gene expression patterns play a critical role in the development
              of complex traits and diseases. Functional genomics has provided
              valuable insights into this process, but identifying therapeutic
              targets and drug mechanisms remains challenging. Our study aimed
              to address these challenges by integrating gene co-expression data
              with genetic studies to identify disease etiology and potential
              drug targets. We developed a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which

              modules in specific cell types. Our results showed that diseases

              Gene expression patterns play a pivotal role in determining how
              genes influence complex traits and disease mechanisms, but their
              mechanistic understanding is critical for developing new
              therapies. Our study has shown that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and
              infer mechanisms of action. We also used a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, the PhenoPLIER framework
              provides a novel context for interpreting genetic associations
              through gene modules, which can help identify potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies and inform drug repurposing
              efforts.

              Genetic studies have traditionally focused on analyzing individual
              genes in isolation, but this approach fails to capture how genes
              interact with each other and contribute to complex traits.
              Functional genomics provides a way to investigate these
              interactions, allowing researchers to identify co-expressed genes
              and understand their roles in disease mechanisms. However, the
              vast amount of data generated by functional genomics studies makes
              it challenging to identify key players and therapeutic targets.
              Our manuscript presents an innovative approach that uses gene
              expression patterns to predict disease associations and drug

              co-expressed genes into modules and analyzed their roles in
              disease etiology. Our results show that diseases are significantly
              associated with specific gene modules, and our method accurately
              predicted known drug-disease pairs and identified potential
              targets missed by single-gene strategies. Additionally, we used a
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that
              functionally important players lack associations but were
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall,
              our study provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules, highlighting the
              importance of considering gene interactions in disease etiology
              and drug discovery.

              Genetic studies often focus on individual genes in isolation, but
              understanding how genes work together to influence complex traits
              is crucial for developing effective therapies. In this study, we
              explored gene expression patterns and their association with
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms using functional genomics
              approaches. We found that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicted known drug-disease pairs and
              inferred mechanisms of action. Additionally, we used a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally
              important players were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER, even if they lacked direct associations. This suggests
              that by contextualizing genetic associations through groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can reveal potential targets missed
              by single-gene strategies and provide a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations. Our findings highlight the
              importance of integrating functional genomics data with other
              types of genomic information to gain a more comprehensive
              understanding of complex traits and disease mechanisms, ultimately
              leading to the discovery of new therapeutic targets and drug
              repurposing opportunities.

              The present study aims to identify the molecular mechanisms
              underlying complex traits by analyzing gene expression patterns in
              specific contexts. Our findings indicate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is highly accurate in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. In
              addition, we used a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation
              and found that functionally important players were not associated
              but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These
              results demonstrate the value of using groups of co-expressed
              genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
              targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our novel framework,

              The study of genes and their interactions is central to
              understanding complex traits and disease mechanisms. However,
              determining how these genes work together in specific contexts

              a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through

              types, and our approach accurately predicted known drug-disease

              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions and determining how they influence complex traits
              requires an understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions. The role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms has been uncovered through
              transcriptome-wide association studies. However, modern models
              predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
              origin and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated

              Genetic studies have provided valuable insights into the etiology
              and drug mechanisms of complex diseases. However, they often fail
              to capture the functional relationships between genes, making it
              challenging to identify potential therapeutic targets. Here we
              present a novel approach called PhenoPLIER that leverages gene
              co-expression patterns to project genetic associations onto gene
              expression data, thus highlighting disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms.


              PhenoPLIER uses clustering algorithms to group genes with similar
              expression patterns across different conditions, thereby
              identifying modules of functionally related genes. We then map
              these gene modules onto disease-relevant transcriptome-wide
              association studies, pharmacological perturbation data, and CRISPR
              screens to identify the most relevant modules for each disease or
              trait.


              Our results show that PhenoPLIER can accurately predict known
              drug-disease pairs, infer mechanisms of action, and uncover novel
              potential therapeutic targets. For example, we found that genes
              involved in lipid regulation are not associated with any specific
              disease in traditional genetic studies but were highly prioritized
              in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              Overall, our findings underscore the importance of gene
              co-expression patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanism
              discovery, and PhenoPLIER provides a valuable tool for identifying
              potential therapeutic targets through gene expression data
              analysis.

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding gene expression
              patterns and their role in complex traits is crucial for
              developing new therapeutic targets. Recent transcriptome-wide

              Genetic studies and functional genomics have long been used to
              identify disease risk factors. However, the complexity of gene
              expression patterns across different conditions makes it
              challenging to determine how individual genes influence complex
              traits. This challenge is particularly relevant in the context of
              drug development, where a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation is critical for developing effective therapies.


              To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.


              Our results suggest that functional important players may lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. This finding highlights the importance of considering
              gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
              Overall, our approach provides a powerful tool for identifying

              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.

              The role of genes in complex traits is critical for developing new
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have provided
              insights into the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, but modern models of the architecture of complex
              traits suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in

              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, our approach provides new insights
              into the relationship between gene expression patterns and disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms.

              Genetic studies have traditionally focused on individual genes and
              their association with disease outcomes, but recent advances in
              functional genomics suggest that gene co-expression patterns may
              provide valuable insights into disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms. The identification of key modules of differentially
              expressed genes across various conditions can help predict complex
              trait associations and identify novel therapeutic targets for drug
              repurposing. In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that integrates transcriptome-wide
              association studies with pharmacological perturbation data to map
              gene-trait associations into a common latent representation based
              on gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. By using
              PhenoPLIER, we were able to predict known drug-disease pairs and
              infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we used a CRISPR screen
              to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important
              players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by our approach. Our findings highlight the importance of
              considering gene co-expression patterns in disease etiology and
              drug mechanisms, and provide a valuable tool for identifying new
              therapeutic targets through clustering of complex traits.
