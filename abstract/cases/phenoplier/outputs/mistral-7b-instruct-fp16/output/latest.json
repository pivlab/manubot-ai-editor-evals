Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

However, traditional approaches to studying gene expression patterns across different conditions have limitations, as they often focus on individual genes rather than their interactions with other genes. In this manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach is based on the idea that genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions are likely to be involved in similar biological processes, allowing us to identify potential drug targets and mechanisms of action. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER through several case studies, including a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, which revealed important players that lacked associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a more comprehensive understanding of complex traits and their underlying mechanisms. Overall, our work highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in disease research and demonstrates the value of computational approaches for identifying potential drug targets and mechanisms of action."

It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.

We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Overall, our work provides a novel mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation in complex traits and has broader significance for the development of new therapies."

While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify individual genes involved in disease-relevant processes, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, which allows us to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER through an analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, where we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes in understanding gene-gene interactions and their role in disease mechanisms.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph.

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.

Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          "output": "The field of genetic studies has made significant strides in identifying disease-associated genes, but the complexity of these diseases often requires a more nuanced approach to understanding their underlying mechanisms. The use of functional genomics techniques such as gene co-expression analysis can provide valuable insights into how genes interact with each other and contribute to complex traits. However, current methods for integrating gene expression data with other types of genomic and clinical data are limited by the lack of a common representation that can capture the relationships between these different types of information.\n\nTo address this gap in the literature, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, which allows us to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER through several case studies, including the prediction of known drug-disease pairs and the identification of functionally important players in lipid regulation that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our results highlight the importance of considering gene expression patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and suggest that our approach could be used to identify new therapeutic targets for complex diseases.\n\nOverall, PhenoPLIER represents a significant advancement in the field of genetic studies by providing a common representation that can capture the relationships between different types of genomic and clinical data. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our method provides a more nuanced understanding of complex traits and their underlying mechanisms, which is critical for developing new therapies."

However, the complexity of gene-gene interactions makes it challenging to identify therapeutic targets or predict drug repurposing. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges the gap between gene expression patterns and disease etiology by identifying modules of genes with similar expression profiles in relevant cell types. Our analysis reveals that diseases are associated with these gene modules, which can be used to predict drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrate how PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important players in trait-associated modules, even when they lack direct associations. By contextualizing genetic associations through gene co-expression analysis, PhenoPLIER provides a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions, which is critical for developing new therapies.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph.

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis of complex traits. Our approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, and we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, our method is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions, which is critical for developing new therapies. We demonstrate this by using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings highlight the importance of gene co-expression patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and provide a new tool for identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs. By filling this gap in the current literature, our work has broader significance for the development of personalized medicine and precision therapies."

          "output": "The field of functional genomics has revolutionized our understanding of how genetic variations contribute to disease risk and therapeutic response. However, existing methods have difficulty capturing the complex interplay between genes and traits, particularly when multiple genes are involved in a disease process. This manuscript presents PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that addresses this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, and we show that diseases are significantly associated with these modules in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, demonstrating its utility as a tool for drug repurposing and identifying novel therapeutic targets. Moreover, our approach highlights the importance of contextualizing genetic associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes. We illustrate this point using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, where we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression, and that understanding these interactions is essential for developing new therapies. Overall, this work advances our knowledge of the genetic basis of complex traits and provides a powerful tool for drug discovery and repurposing."

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill.

To address this challenge, researchers have turned to functional genomics approaches that analyze gene expression patterns across different conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in identifying individual genes associated with specific diseases, recent models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding how genes work together to influence complex traits. However, the traditional approach of studying individual genes has limitations in predicting disease etiology and drug mechanisms. To overcome this challenge, we propose a computational approach called PhenoPLIER that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our approach is based on the idea that groups of co-expressed genes can provide contextual information that may be missed by single-gene strategies. In this study, we applied PhenoPLIER to lipid regulation in a CRISPR screen and found that functionally important players lack associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our results demonstrate the potential of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, highlighting its importance in identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs for complex traits. Overall, our work provides a novel computational tool that can bridge the gap between genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, and clustering of complex traits."

Functional genomics techniques have been used to study gene-gene interactions, but they often fail to capture the contextual factors that influence expression regulation. In this manuscript, we present a novel approach called PhenoPLIER that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and show that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our approach provides a valuable tool for identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs based on their mechanisms of action."

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.

However, the complexity of the human genome and its interactions with other molecules make it difficult to identify specific genes that contribute to complex traits. In this manuscript, we propose a novel computational approach called PhenoPLIER that combines gene expression data and pharmacological perturbation data to map gene-trait associations into a common latent representation. By using modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, where we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Overall, our work highlights the importance of gene co-expression analysis in identifying therapeutic targets and drug repurposing for complex traits."

However, traditional approaches to genetic studies have focused primarily on individual gene associations with disease outcomes. This manuscript presents a novel computational approach called PhenoPLIER that addresses this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER through a variety of analyses, including the identification of disease-associated gene modules in relevant cell types and the prediction of known drug-disease pairs. Additionally, they use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, this study provides a valuable contribution to the field of functional genomics by highlighting the importance of gene co-expression in understanding complex traits and drug mechanisms."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.

Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

          "output": "Context: The field of genetics and disease research has made significant strides in recent years, with the identification of individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms through transcriptome-wide association studies. However, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression, which requires a more comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. This study aims to address this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.\n\nContent: PhenoPLIER is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, which allows it to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. The approach has been tested using disease association data and CRISPR screens, and the results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action for functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules.\n\nConclusion: This study highlights the importance of incorporating gene-gene interactions in disease research and demonstrates how PhenoPLIER can provide valuable insights into complex traits. The findings suggest that disease-relevant mechanisms involve groups of co-expressed genes, which may have broader significance for drug discovery and development. Overall, this study contributes to our understanding of gene expression regulation and its role in disease pathogenesis."

          "output": "Genetic studies have contributed significantly to our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, yet the complex nature of these phenomena often hinders their interpretation. To address this challenge, functional genomics approaches have been developed to identify gene-gene interactions that underlie disease development and progression. However, traditional methods for analyzing gene expression patterns are limited by their focus on individual genes and fail to account for the contextual relationships between them. In this manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene co-expression analysis to map genetic associations onto a common latent representation of gene modules and pharmacological perturbation data. By integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide a more comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms and identify potential therapeutic targets that may have been missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, as well as identifying functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules.

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

However, current models of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a key role in disease origin and progression. To understand these interactions and identify potential targets for new therapies, researchers have been using transcriptome-wide association studies to uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, these studies have limitations in identifying the contextual relationships between genes and traits.\n\nTo address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our approach uses modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.\n\nAdditionally, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results highlight the importance of considering gene-gene interactions and contextual relationships in understanding complex traits and developing new therapies.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify individual genes associated with diseases, recent models predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and progression. This gap in the literature calls for a more comprehensive approach to identify gene-trait associations and potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. In this manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER in identifying functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. Overall, our study provides a novel computational approach to identify gene-trait associations and potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, which has broader significance for developing new therapies and understanding complex disease mechanisms."

However, current methods are limited in their ability to account for gene-gene interactions and the contextual regulation of expression patterns across different conditions. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that uses gene co-expression analysis to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our findings provide a novel approach to gene expression analysis that has the potential to improve our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately leading to more effective therapeutic targets and repurposing strategies.",

However, traditional approaches to studying gene expression patterns across different conditions have limitations, as they often focus on individual genes rather than their interactions with other genes. In this manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach is based on the idea that genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions are likely to be involved in similar biological processes, allowing us to identify potential drug targets and mechanisms of action. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER through several case studies, including a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, which revealed important players that lacked associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a more comprehensive understanding of complex traits and their underlying mechanisms. Overall, our work highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in disease research and demonstrates the value of computational approaches for identifying potential drug targets and mechanisms of action.",

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify individual genes associated with disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions are critical for disease origin and progression. To address this gap in our understanding, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, which we observe are significantl associated with diseases in relevant cell types. We find that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, providing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our approach contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets that could be prioritized for further investigation. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for understanding gene-gene interactions in complex traits, which has important implications for disease prediction and drug discovery.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "text": "Failed\n---\nThe field of genetic studies has made significant strides in identifying disease-associated genes, but the complexity of these diseases often requires a more nuanced approach to understanding their underlying mechanisms. The use of functional genomics techniques such as gene co-expression analysis can provide valuable insights into how genes interact with each other and contribute to complex traits. However, current methods for integrating gene expression data with other types of genomic and clinical data are limited by the lack of a common representation that can capture the relationships between these different types of information.\n\nTo address this gap in the literature, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, which allows us to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER through several case studies, including the prediction of known drug-disease pairs and the identification of functionally important players in lipid regulation that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our results highlight the importance of considering gene expression patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and suggest that our approach could be used to identify new therapeutic targets for complex diseases.\n\nOverall, PhenoPLIER represents a significant advancement in the field of genetic studies by providing a common representation that can capture the relationships between different types of genomic and clinical data. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our method provides a more nuanced understanding of complex traits and their underlying mechanisms, which is critical for developing new therapies.",

However, the current state-of-the-art lacks a comprehensive approach that can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis of complex traits.

Our findings highlight the importance of gene co-expression patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and provide a new tool for identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

However, existing methods have difficulty capturing the complex interplay between genes and traits, particularly when multiple genes are involved in a disease process. This manuscript presents PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that addresses this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, and we show that diseases are significantly associated with these modules in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, demonstrating its utility as a tool for drug repurposing and identifying novel therapeutic targets. Moreover, our approach highlights the importance of contextualizing genetic associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes. We illustrate this point using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, where we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression, and that understanding these interactions is essential for developing new therapies. Overall, this work advances our knowledge of the genetic basis of complex traits and provides a powerful tool for drug discovery and repurposing.",

              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

To address this challenge, researchers have turned to functional genomics approaches that analyze gene expression patterns across different conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in identifying individual genes associated with specific diseases, recent models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

However, traditional approaches to understanding these patterns have limitations, particularly when considering gene-gene interactions. In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach takes into account groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs, inferring mechanisms of action, and identifying disease-associated gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our findings highlight the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in complex trait studies and provide a powerful tool for drug repurposing and therapeutic target discovery.",

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

However, the traditional approach of studying individual genes has limitations in predicting disease etiology and drug mechanisms. To overcome this challenge, we propose a computational approach called PhenoPLIER that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our approach is based on the idea that groups of co-expressed genes can provide contextual information that may be missed by single-gene strategies. In this study, we applied PhenoPLIER to lipid regulation in a CRISPR screen and found that functionally important players lack associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our results demonstrate the potential of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, highlighting its importance in identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs for complex traits. Overall, our work provides a novel computational tool that can bridge the gap between genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, and clustering of complex traits.",

              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

However, the complexity of gene expression patterns has made it challenging to identify specific genes that contribute to complex traits. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Our approach is based on the observation that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We demonstrate that our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes. Furthermore, we show that PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our findings highlight the importance of gene co-expression in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and provide a novel tool for identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs.",

However, the complexity of the human genome and its interactions with other molecules make it difficult to identify specific genes that contribute to complex traits. In this manuscript, we propose a novel computational approach called PhenoPLIER that combines gene expression data and pharmacological perturbation data to map gene-trait associations into a common latent representation. By using modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, where we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules.

However, traditional approaches to genetic studies have focused primarily on individual gene associations with disease outcomes. This manuscript presents a novel computational approach called PhenoPLIER that addresses this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER through a variety of analyses, including the identification of disease-associated gene modules in relevant cell types and the prediction of known drug-disease pairs. Additionally, they use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, this study provides a valuable contribution to the field of functional genomics by highlighting the importance of gene co-expression in understanding complex traits and drug mechanisms.",

The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

Determining the influence of these genes on disease requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions, which has been shown to be critical for developing new therapies. However, current models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression, highlighting a gap in our current understanding of complex traits.\nContent: To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\nConclusion: Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings provide new insights into the role of gene-gene interactions in disease and highlight the importance of considering gene expression patterns in complex trait studies.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

              "text": "Genetic studies have contributed significantly to our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, yet the complex nature of these phenomena often hinders their interpretation. To address this challenge, functional genomics approaches have been developed to identify gene-gene interactions that underlie disease development and progression. However, traditional methods for analyzing gene expression patterns are limited by their focus on individual genes and fail to account for the contextual relationships between them. In this manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages gene co-expression analysis to map genetic associations onto a common latent representation of gene modules and pharmacological perturbation data. By integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide a more comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms and identify potential therapeutic targets that may have been missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, as well as identifying functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Overall, our work highlights the importance of gene expression patterns in disease etiology and drug discovery, and paves the way for new therapeutic strategies based on clustering complex traits.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

However, current models of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a key role in disease origin and progression. To understand these interactions and identify potential targets for new therapies, researchers have been using transcriptome-wide association studies to uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, these studies have limitations in identifying the contextual relationships between genes and traits.\n\nTo address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our approach uses modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.\n\nAdditionally, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results highlight the importance of considering gene-gene interactions and contextual relationships in understanding complex traits and developing new therapies. Overall, our approach provides a powerful tool for identifying potential targets and mechanisms of action in complex diseases.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",
