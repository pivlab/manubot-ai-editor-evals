Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying individual genes associated with diseases, recent research suggests that gene-gene interactions are critical for disease etiology and progression. In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. We demonstrate this by using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, where we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings provide a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, and highlight the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in disease mechanisms and drug development.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph: ",

          "output": "\nThe study of complex traits is challenging due to the involvement of multiple genes interacting in specific contexts. While previous studies have identified individual genes that contribute to disease mechanisms, it is increasingly recognized that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. This highlights the need for new approaches that can capture these interactions and provide insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data to map gene modules in a common latent representation. Our analysis reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. We further use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which can contextualize these associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach has broader significance as it can facilitate the discovery of therapeutic targets and drug repurposing in complex diseases."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": "In recent years, advances in functional genomics have provided new insights into the complex relationships between genes and disease mechanisms. However, traditional approaches to understanding these relationships are limited by a focus on individual genes and their associations with specific traits. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to identify potential therapeutic targets and predict drug responses. By mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, we demonstrate the power of this approach in identifying disease-relevant genes and predicting known drug-disease pairs. Moreover, our results suggest that PhenoPLIER can provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying complex traits by contextualizing genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of a systems-level approach to understanding disease etiology and drug responses and provide a novel framework for identifying potential therapeutic targets and predicting drug effects."

We demonstrate how genes function together in specific contexts to perform their roles, highlighting the importance of understanding expression regulation across different conditions for uncovering disease mechanisms and drug targets. While previous studies have used transcriptome-wide association studies to identify individual gene contributions to complex traits, our approach leverages groups of co-expressed genes to provide a more comprehensive analysis. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, we demonstrate how functionally important players can be missed by single-gene analyses but are prioritized within trait-associated modules using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation. Overall, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, providing valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our study highlights the importance of integrating multiple sources of genomic data to gain a comprehensive understanding of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

While recent studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various contexts is critical for developing new therapies. In this study, we address this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.\n\nContent: Our method is based on identifying modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, and we observe that diseases are significantly associated with these module-level gene-gene interactions. Using PhenoPLIER, we can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. In addition, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by our method.\n\nConclusion: PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations through the lens of gene modules provides a novel framework for understanding complex diseases. Our method can reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, and it has the potential to improve drug discovery and development.

Our approach leverages the concept of gene co-expression, where genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions. We show that PhenoPLIER's representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and identifies novel mechanisms of action. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER in a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, where we prioritize functionally important players missed by single-gene strategies within trait-associated modules. Our findings highlight the importance of contextualizing genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and provide a novel framework for interpreting complex disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph: ",

          "output": "\nThe study presents PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational method that bridges the gap between gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data by mapping them into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts, and determining how they influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have unveiled the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. The study finds that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, the study reveals that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          "output": "\nIn recent years, there has been growing interest in the use of functional genomics to identify potential therapeutic targets for complex diseases. However, the current approach to disease etiology and drug mechanisms is limited by its focus on single-gene studies, which fail to account for gene-gene interactions that play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we have developed PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By leveraging modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. We demonstrate this by using PhenoPLIER to analyze lipid regulation in response to CRISPR screens, where we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's representation provides a powerful tool for projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns and highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of complex diseases and guide the development of new therapies."

PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our approach observes that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and contextualizing genetic associations, thus revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach can be applied to various complex traits, such as disease etiology and drug mechanisms, highlighting the importance of gene co-expression in understanding these processes."

Functional genomics has provided valuable insights into this process, but identifying therapeutic targets and drug mechanisms remains challenging. Our study aimed to address these challenges by integrating gene co-expression data with genetic studies to identify disease etiology and potential drug targets. We developed a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which uses clustering of complex traits to identify relevant gene modules in specific cell types. Our results showed that diseases were significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicted known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important players lack associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, our study demonstrates the potential of gene modules as a contextualization tool for genetic associations, which could lead to the discovery of new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing strategies."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph: ",

          "output": "\nGenetic studies have traditionally focused on analyzing individual genes in isolation, but this approach fails to capture how genes interact with each other and contribute to complex traits. Functional genomics provides a way to investigate these interactions, allowing researchers to identify co-expressed genes and understand their roles in disease mechanisms. However, the vast amount of data generated by functional genomics studies makes it challenging to identify key players and therapeutic targets. Our manuscript presents an innovative approach that uses gene expression patterns to predict disease associations and drug repurposing. We utilized clustering algorithms to group co-expressed genes into modules and analyzed their roles in disease etiology. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules, and our method accurately predicted known drug-disease pairs and identified potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Additionally, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important players lack associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, our study provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, highlighting the importance of considering gene interactions in disease etiology and drug discovery."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": "Genetic studies have provided valuable insights into the etiology and drug mechanisms of complex diseases. However, they often fail to capture the functional relationships between genes, making it challenging to identify potential therapeutic targets. Here we present a novel approach called PhenoPLIER that leverages gene co-expression patterns to project genetic associations onto gene expression data, thus highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nPhenoPLIER uses clustering algorithms to group genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, thereby identifying modules of functionally related genes. We then map these gene modules onto disease-relevant transcriptome-wide association studies, pharmacological perturbation data, and CRISPR screens to identify the most relevant modules for each disease or trait.\n\nOur results show that PhenoPLIER can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs, infer mechanisms of action, and uncover novel potential therapeutic targets. For example, we found that genes involved in lipid regulation are not associated with any specific disease in traditional genetic studies but were highly prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nOverall, our findings underscore the importance of gene co-expression patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanism discovery, and PhenoPLIER provides a valuable tool for identifying potential therapeutic targets through gene expression data analysis."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

To uncover these relationships, we have developed a computational approach called PhenoPLIER that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, which we observe to be significantly associated with diseases expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. We further demonstrate this by using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and finding that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Overall, our study highlights the importance of gene co-expression analysis in understanding complex traits and identifying therapeutic targets for drug repurposing."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph: ",

          "output": "\nGenetic studies and functional genomics have long been used to identify disease risk factors. However, the complexity of gene expression patterns across different conditions makes it challenging to determine how individual genes influence complex traits. This challenge is particularly relevant in the context of drug development, where a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation is critical for developing effective therapies.\n\nTo address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.\n\nOur results suggest that functional important players may lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This finding highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Overall, our approach provides a powerful tool for identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs for new indications."

The identification of key modules of differentially expressed genes across various conditions can help predict complex trait associations and identify novel therapeutic targets for drug repurposing. In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates transcriptome-wide association studies with pharmacological perturbation data to map gene-trait associations into a common latent representation based on gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. By using PhenoPLIER, we were able to predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by our approach. Our findings highlight the importance of considering gene co-expression patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and provide a valuable tool for identifying new therapeutic targets through clustering of complex traits."

However, functional genomics techniques such as gene co-expression analysis have revealed that genes do not act in isolation but interact with each other to perform their functions. Understanding these interactions is critical for developing new therapies, as modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.\n\nTo fill this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.\n\nMoreover, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings suggest that by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.

              "text": "\nThe study of complex traits is challenging due to the involvement of multiple genes interacting in specific contexts. While previous studies have identified individual genes that contribute to disease mechanisms, it is increasingly recognized that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. This highlights the need for new approaches that can capture these interactions and provide insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data to map gene modules in a common latent representation. Our analysis reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. We further use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which can contextualize these associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach has broader significance as it can facilitate the discovery of therapeutic targets and drug repurposing in complex diseases.",

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.

We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. We also find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

However, traditional approaches to understanding these relationships are limited by a focus on individual genes and their associations with specific traits. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to identify potential therapeutic targets and predict drug responses. By mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, we demonstrate the power of this approach in identifying disease-relevant genes and predicting known drug-disease pairs. Moreover, our results suggest that PhenoPLIER can provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying complex traits by contextualizing genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of a systems-level approach to understanding disease etiology and drug responses and provide a novel framework for identifying potential therapeutic targets and predicting drug effects.",

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Gene expression patterns are highly contextual and can be influenced by various factors. Therefore, determining how these genes contribute to complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of their regulation across different conditions. Recent transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play an essential role in disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER's approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important players lack associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's framework provides a novel way to contextualize genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, allowing us to identify potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.",

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

              "text": "\nIn recent years, there has been growing interest in the use of functional genomics to identify potential therapeutic targets for complex diseases. However, the current approach to disease etiology and drug mechanisms is limited by its focus on single-gene studies, which fail to account for gene-gene interactions that play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we have developed PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By leveraging modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. We demonstrate this by using PhenoPLIER to analyze lipid regulation in response to CRISPR screens, where we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's representation provides a powerful tool for projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns and highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of complex diseases and guide the development of new therapies.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

The field of functional genomics has shown that genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions, and determining how these genes influence complex traits requires an understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. Modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. However, transcriptome-wide association studies have only uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, leaving out the importance of gene-gene interactions. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our approach observes that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and contextualizing genetic associations, thus revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach can be applied to various complex traits, such as disease etiology and drug mechanisms, highlighting the importance of gene co-expression in understanding these processes.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Our study has shown that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. We also used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, the PhenoPLIER framework provides a novel context for interpreting genetic associations through gene modules, which can help identify potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and inform drug repurposing efforts.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.

Functional genomics provides a way to investigate these interactions, allowing researchers to identify co-expressed genes and understand their roles in disease mechanisms. However, the vast amount of data generated by functional genomics studies makes it challenging to identify key players and therapeutic targets. Our manuscript presents an innovative approach that uses gene expression patterns to predict disease associations and drug repurposing. We utilized clustering algorithms to group co-expressed genes into modules and analyzed their roles in disease etiology. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules, and our method accurately predicted known drug-disease pairs and identified potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Additionally, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important players lack associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, our study provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, highlighting the importance of considering gene interactions in disease etiology and drug discovery.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

However, they often fail to capture the functional relationships between genes, making it challenging to identify potential therapeutic targets. Here we present a novel approach called PhenoPLIER that leverages gene co-expression patterns to project genetic associations onto gene expression data, thus highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nPhenoPLIER uses clustering algorithms to group genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, thereby identifying modules of functionally related genes. We then map these gene modules onto disease-relevant transcriptome-wide association studies, pharmacological perturbation data, and CRISPR screens to identify the most relevant modules for each disease or trait.\n\nOur results show that PhenoPLIER can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs, infer mechanisms of action, and uncover novel potential therapeutic targets. For example, we found that genes involved in lipid regulation are not associated with any specific disease in traditional genetic studies but were highly prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nOverall, our findings underscore the importance of gene co-expression patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanism discovery, and PhenoPLIER provides a valuable tool for identifying potential therapeutic targets through gene expression data analysis.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Recent transcriptome-wide association studies have provided insights into individual gene associations with disease-relevant mechanisms, but they have not fully captured the complexity of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene expression patterns and pharmacological perturbation data to identify common latent representations of gene modules that are associated with complex traits. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

However, the complexity of gene expression patterns across different conditions makes it challenging to determine how individual genes influence complex traits. This challenge is particularly relevant in the context of drug development, where a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation is critical for developing effective therapies.\n\nTo address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.\n\nOur results suggest that functional important players may lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This finding highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Overall, our approach provides a powerful tool for identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs for new indications.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

              "text": "\nGenetic studies have traditionally focused on individual genes and their association with disease outcomes, but recent advances in functional genomics suggest that gene co-expression patterns may provide valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. The identification of key modules of differentially expressed genes across various conditions can help predict complex trait associations and identify novel therapeutic targets for drug repurposing. In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates transcriptome-wide association studies with pharmacological perturbation data to map gene-trait associations into a common latent representation based on gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. By using PhenoPLIER, we were able to predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by our approach. Our findings highlight the importance of considering gene co-expression patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and provide a valuable tool for identifying new therapeutic targets through clustering of complex traits.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph: ",
