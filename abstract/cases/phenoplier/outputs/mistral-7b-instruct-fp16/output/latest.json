Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "\nIn recent years, there has been an increasing need to understand the complex interplay between genes in specific contexts to elucidate disease mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic targets. Traditional single-gene studies have limitations in capturing the impact of gene-gene interactions on complex traits. To address this gap, we developed a novel computational approach called PhenoPLIER that maps gene expression data, pharmacological perturbation data, and disease associations into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our analysis revealed that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicted known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action. Moreover, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important players were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, even when they lacked individual gene associations. These results demonstrate the potential of PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. In conclusion, our method provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which can aid in the development of new therapies and the identification of drug repurposing opportunities."

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

This is where gene co-expression analysis can be helpful. By analyzing gene expression patterns across different conditions, we can identify groups of genes that work together in specific contexts to perform their functions. However, traditional methods for analyzing gene expression data are limited in their ability to capture the complex interactions between genes.\n\nIn this manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By leveraging modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, PhenoPLIER is able to provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the relationships between genes and complex traits.\n\nUsing PhenoPLIER, we were able to predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, as well as identify potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We also used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important players lacked associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

By leveraging the concept of gene modules, which are groups of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nThe study demonstrates the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER in identifying disease etiology and drug mechanisms by analyzing transcriptome-wide association studies and CRISPR screens. The results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.\n\nFurthermore, the study highlights the importance of functional genomics and gene co-expression in identifying therapeutic targets for complex traits such as lipid regulation. The findings suggest that functionally important players may lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nOverall, the study provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which can have significant implications for drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Genes act together in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. Previous research has demonstrated the importance of this insight in developing new therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have helped reveal individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, which is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which can contextualize these associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach has significant implications for therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing, as it allows us to identify clusters of complex traits that are not apparent in single-gene studies."

However, the complexity of these relationships has made it challenging to identify specific genetic associations that play a role in disease development and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that uses gene co-expression patterns to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By combining groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of disease mechanisms and drug mechanisms. We demonstrate that our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action by observing significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, we use PhenoPLIER to identify functionally important players in lipid regulation that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our results highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER as a powerful tool for identifying therapeutic targets and drug repurposing strategies. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel and valuable approach to projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns, which can significantly enhance our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms."

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

While this insight has shown promise for developing new therapies, there remains a gap in our ability to accurately predict disease associations and infer mechanisms of action through the analysis of gene expression patterns. In this study, we sought to fill this gap by projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns. Specifically, we used clustering algorithms to identify groups of co-expressed genes that are associated with specific complex traits. Our approach was successful in accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, we applied a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important players were prioritized in trait-associated modules despite lacking significant associations. Taken together, our results demonstrate the value of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes in the analysis of genetic associations, as this approach can contextualize these associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is highly accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Functional genomics techniques, such as gene co-expression analysis, have emerged as a promising approach to uncovering disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However, existing methods lack the ability to contextualize genetic associations by considering groups of co-expressed genes. In this study, we developed PhenoPLIER, a novel tool that integrates gene modules expressed in relevant cell types to predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in specific contexts.

Despite extensive genetic studies, the mechanistic regulation of gene expression across different conditions remains poorly understood. Our study addresses this gap by investigating how diseases are associated with specific groups of co-expressed genes in relevant cell types.\n\nTo achieve this, we developed a novel approach called PhenoPLIER that integrates gene expression data with functional genomics information to identify disease-associated modules. We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using CRISPR screens to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nOur results show that by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules has significant implications for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing.\n\nIn conclusion, our study provides a valuable resource for researchers seeking to better understand the complex interplay of genes in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. The PhenoPLIER approach can facilitate clustering of complex traits and inform therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating gene expression patterns."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

This approach involves identifying groups of genes that exhibit coordinated expression patterns under different conditions, which can provide insights into the mechanisms underlying complex traits. The authors introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational tool that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data to identify gene modules associated with disease etiology and drug response mechanisms. By leveraging functional genomics techniques such as clustering of complex traits, the study identifies key players in lipid regulation that lack direct genetic associations but are prioritized by PhenoPLIER based on their co-expression patterns with known disease-associated genes. These findings demonstrate the importance of considering gene expression patterns and functional genomics data in understanding the underlying mechanisms of complex traits and identifying potential therapeutic targets for drug repurposing."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Although previous studies have identified individual genes associated with disease, recent models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease onset and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By leveraging modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with trait-specific gene modules and accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we show that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in disease-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our study provides valuable insights into the role of gene co-expression patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, which could inform novel therapeutic strategies and accelerate drug repurposing efforts."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Traditional approaches to studying complex traits have relied on analyzing individual gene expression patterns, but recent research suggests that gene-gene interactions are critical for disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, we demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and identifying functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Overall, PhenoPLIER highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms and provides a valuable tool for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing."

              "text": "\nThe study of genes and their functions in specific contexts has been a crucial field of research, as it is essential to understand how these genes influence complex traits. Traditional methods have focused on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, and we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, enabling us to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This study fills a gap in the literature by introducing a new computational approach that improves our understanding of gene expression patterns and their role in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.

              "text": "\nIn recent years, there has been an increasing need to understand the complex interplay between genes in specific contexts to elucidate disease mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic targets. Traditional single-gene studies have limitations in capturing the impact of gene-gene interactions on complex traits. To address this gap, we developed a novel computational approach called PhenoPLIER that maps gene expression data, pharmacological perturbation data, and disease associations into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our analysis revealed that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicted known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action. Moreover, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important players were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, even when they lacked individual gene associations. These results demonstrate the potential of PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. In conclusion, our method provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which can aid in the development of new therapies and the identification of drug repurposing opportunities.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.

A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

However, the complexity of gene-gene interactions has hindered our ability to identify therapeutic targets and mechanisms of action. This manuscript introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our approach identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, which are then used to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER in identifying novel therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities. Overall, this manuscript provides a valuable contribution to the field of functional genomics and gene co-expression analysis, highlighting the importance of gene modules in understanding disease mechanisms and developing effective therapies.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Genes act together in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. Previous research has demonstrated the importance of this insight in developing new therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have helped reveal individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, which is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which can contextualize these associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach has significant implications for therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing, as it allows us to identify clusters of complex traits that are not apparent in single-gene studies.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Recent transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are crucial for disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By analyzing modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which is critical for developing new therapies and drug repurposing.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

However, the complexity of these relationships has made it challenging to identify specific genetic associations that play a role in disease development and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that uses gene co-expression patterns to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By combining groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of disease mechanisms and drug mechanisms. We demonstrate that our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action by observing significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, we use PhenoPLIER to identify functionally important players in lipid regulation that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our results highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER as a powerful tool for identifying therapeutic targets and drug repurposing strategies. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel and valuable approach to projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns, which can significantly enhance our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

However, understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a deeper understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. While this insight has shown promise for developing new therapies, there remains a gap in our ability to accurately predict disease associations and infer mechanisms of action through the analysis of gene expression patterns. In this study, we sought to fill this gap by projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns. Specifically, we used clustering algorithms to identify groups of co-expressed genes that are associated with specific complex traits. Our approach was successful in accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, we applied a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important players were prioritized in trait-associated modules despite lacking significant associations. Taken together, our results demonstrate the value of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes in the analysis of genetic associations, as this approach can contextualize these associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. As such, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which has broader significance for drug discovery and precision medicine.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Despite extensive genetic studies, the mechanistic regulation of gene expression across different conditions remains poorly understood. Our study addresses this gap by investigating how diseases are associated with specific groups of co-expressed genes in relevant cell types.\n\nTo achieve this, we developed a novel approach called PhenoPLIER that integrates gene expression data with functional genomics information to identify disease-associated modules. We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using CRISPR screens to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nOur results show that by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules has significant implications for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing.\n\nIn conclusion, our study provides a valuable resource for researchers seeking to better understand the complex interplay of genes in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. The PhenoPLIER approach can facilitate clustering of complex traits and inform therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating gene expression patterns.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

It highlights the importance of understanding gene expression regulation across different conditions, particularly in the development of new therapies. The open question that this research addresses is how to accurately predict disease associations and infer mechanisms of action through groups of co-expressed genes.\n\nTo fill this gap, we have developed a novel approach called PhenoPLIER, which integrates gene modules expressed in relevant cell types to contextualize genetic associations. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, we have used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn conclusion, our findings demonstrate that by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework provides a powerful tool for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which has broad implications for drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

This approach involves identifying groups of genes that exhibit coordinated expression patterns under different conditions, which can provide insights into the mechanisms underlying complex traits. The authors introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational tool that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data to identify gene modules associated with disease etiology and drug response mechanisms. By leveraging functional genomics techniques such as clustering of complex traits, the study identifies key players in lipid regulation that lack direct genetic associations but are prioritized by PhenoPLIER based on their co-expression patterns with known disease-associated genes. These findings demonstrate the importance of considering gene expression patterns and functional genomics data in understanding the underlying mechanisms of complex traits and identifying potential therapeutic targets for drug repurposing.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Although previous studies have identified individual genes associated with disease, recent models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease onset and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By leveraging modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with trait-specific gene modules and accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we show that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in disease-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Traditional approaches to studying complex traits have relied on analyzing individual gene expression patterns, but recent research suggests that gene-gene interactions are critical for disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, we demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and identifying functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Overall, PhenoPLIER highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms and provides a valuable tool for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",
