Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene expression patterns to common latent representations for joint analysis. Our method identifies modules of genes with similar expression profiles across different conditions and reveals the role of these modules in disease development and drug response. We demonstrate that disease-relevant genes are enriched in trait-associated modules, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, we apply PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation and identify functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules. Our findings provide a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene expression patterns, which can inform new therapeutic strategies and drug repurposing efforts."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "\nIn recent years, our understanding of disease mechanisms has been revolutionized by advances in functional genomics and genome-wide association studies. However, while single-gene approaches have provided valuable insights into complex traits, they are limited by the fact that many genes act in concert with each other to produce specific outcomes. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene expression data with pharmacological perturbation information to identify key players in disease pathways. Our method maps gene-trait associations and drug effects into a common latent space based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns under different conditions. Using this representation, we find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. We further validate PhenoPLIER by using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and finding that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which can help identify potential therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities. By contextualizing genetic associations with groups of co-expressed genes, our method can uncover new insights into disease etiology and mechanisms that may have been missed by single-gene strategies."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          "output": "\nComplex traits are influenced by interactions between multiple genes, which makes determining their etiology and mechanisms challenging. While transcriptome-wide association studies have provided insights into individual gene roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, they do not capture the complex interplay of gene expression patterns across different conditions. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. We demonstrate this by using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, where functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can highlight the importance of complex interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This research advances our understanding of complex traits and provides a valuable tool for identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs."

By using PhenoPLIER, we observed that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicted known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action. Moreover, we applied PhenoPLIER to analyze lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen and found that functionally important players lack associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which can help identify potential targets missed by single-gene strategies."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Gene expression patterns play an important role in complex traits, as genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions. This necessitates a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns in the same context. We demonstrate the accuracy and utility of our approach by observing significant associations between disease outcomes and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, even when they lack direct associations. These findings suggest that our approach can provide a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, and may be useful for drug repurposing and target discovery."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Context:\nThe current literature on complex traits highlights that modern models predict the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression, but transcriptome-wide association studies have focused on individual genes. Therefore, there is a need for computational approaches that can contextualize genetic associations through groups of co-expressed genes.\n\n1. Content:\nIn this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. We identify modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions and observe that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, highlighting its potential to reveal targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\n1. Conclusion:\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations through groups of co-expressed genes, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. This approach has the potential to identify new therapeutic targets and improve our understanding of disease etiology and progression. Future studies should incorporate PhenoPLIER in drug discovery pipelines to uncover drug repurposing opportunities and improve treatment outcomes."

          "output": "\nThe manuscript describes the development and application of PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that uses gene expression patterns and pharmacological perturbation data to identify potential therapeutic targets and drug mechanisms for complex diseases. Genes do not function in isolation but interact with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. This requires an understanding of how genes influence complex traits through expression regulation across different conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are crucial for disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By analyzing diseases associated with these modules in relevant cell types, the authors found that their method accurately predicted known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action. Moreover, they used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important players were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's framework provides a new way to interpret genetic associations through the context of gene modules, enabling researchers to identify potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and gain insights into drug mechanisms for complex diseases. This work has significant implications for drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits, and therapeutic target identification in functional genomics studies."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

          "output": "\nThe field of genetics has made significant progress in recent years, but our understanding of complex traits remains limited due to the lack of insight into gene-gene interactions. Traditional approaches that focus on single genes have limitations in uncovering complex disease mechanisms and identifying potential therapeutic targets. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene expression patterns and pharmacological perturbation data to identify functional modules of co-expressed genes. Our method identifies significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, providing accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "\nThe field of genetic studies has been advancing rapidly, with functional genomics providing insights into complex traits and disease mechanisms. However, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are critical in disease origin and progression, highlighting the need for a more holistic approach to understanding how genes influence complex traits. This is where PhenoPLIER comes in. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Our method identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. Overall, our study highlights the importance of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes in understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms."

          "output": "\nThe field of functional genomics has enabled the discovery of new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities. However, there is still much to learn about how genes interact with each other in specific contexts, which can lead to unexpected outcomes. One approach for addressing this challenge is through gene co-expression analysis, which identifies groups of genes that express similarly under different conditions. In this manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. By analyzing the expression patterns of these gene modules in specific cell types, we observed that diseases were significantly associated with relevant gene modules. We also found that our approach was accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. In addition, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important players lacked associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which can aid in disease etiology and drug mechanism studies."

Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

However, understanding these interactions requires a deeper insight into expression regulation across different contexts. Our study demonstrates the importance of this understanding in developing new therapies by showing that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach is highly accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the importance of contextualizing genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which can reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Functional genomics and gene co-expression analyses can provide valuable insights into expression regulation across different conditions, helping us better understand how genes contribute to complex traits. However, current approaches are limited by their focus on single genes or modules, potentially overlooking important regulatory interactions that may be missed. In this study, we developed a new approach called PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations through the analysis of gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with these modules and that our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lack associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, potentially revealing new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

This highlights the importance of understanding expression regulation across different conditions for developing new therapies. In this study, we demonstrate how gene co-expression analysis can be used to identify disease-associated modules and predict drug repurposing outcomes. We also show that CRISPR screening can prioritize functionally important players missed by single-gene strategies. Our findings suggest that integrating groups of co-expressed genes through a framework like PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets for therapeutic interventions, thereby advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms and drug discovery."

          "output": "\nContext: The complex interplay between genes is critical to understanding their functions, particularly in the context of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. While functional genomics has shed light on this interplay, current approaches are limited in their ability to predict disease associations and identify potential therapeutic targets. A novel method is needed to contextualize genetic associations and reveal hidden patterns that may be missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nContent: We present a new approach called PhenoPLIER that leverages gene co-expression patterns to identify functional modules associated with complex traits. Using this approach, we analyzed lipid regulation in cell types implicated in various diseases and found that functionally important players were prioritized in trait-associated modules despite lacking direct associations. Additionally, we validated our approach by predicting known drug-disease pairs and identifying potential therapeutic targets. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can accurately contextualize genetic associations and reveal new insights into disease mechanisms.\n\nConclusion: The ability to contextualize genetic associations through the lens of gene modules provides a novel framework for interpreting complex traits and identifying potential drug targets. PhenoPLIER has broader significance in accelerating drug discovery and developing personalized treatments for diseases that involve multiple genes working together."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph.

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

However, traditional approaches to gene expression analysis often fail to capture complex interactions between genes, which are critical for understanding how traits are influenced by multiple genetic factors. In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates transcriptome-wide association studies with pharmacological perturbation data to map gene-trait associations and drug mechanisms into a common latent representation. Our method uses modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant cell types and conditions to identify disease-relevant genes and drug targets. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, and show that it is also effective in identifying previously overlooked functional players in lipid regulation by prioritizing them within trait-associated modules. Overall, our work provides a novel framework for analyzing gene expression patterns in complex traits and highlights the importance of gene co-expression in disease etiology and drug discovery."

Gene co-expression patterns play a crucial role in complex traits, and gene-gene interactions are predicted to be essential for disease origin and progression. To address these challenges, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene expression data with pharmacological perturbation and trait associations. Our method uses modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions to map gene-trait associations and drug perturbations into a common latent representation for joint analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs, inferring mechanisms of action, and identifying functional players that lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules. Our findings provide new insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms, highlighting the potential of gene expression patterns for identifying therapeutic targets and drug repurposing."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

However, existing models have limitations when it comes to capturing the role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that addresses these challenges by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation. This method identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, which allows us to better understand how genes interact in specific contexts. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important players lack associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings provide insights into the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms of complex traits, which may lead to new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing strategies."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

The current models of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. However, determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, there is a need for a computational approach that can map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common representation for joint analysis. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that does just that by mapping gene modules expressed in relevant cell types into latent representations. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrate the importance of functionally important players lacking associations but being prioritized in trait-associated modules by using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides valuable insights into the role of gene expression patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, thereby filling an important gap in the current literature."

              "text": "Genetic studies have unveiled complex patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, but understanding how these genes interact with each other remains elusive. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene expression patterns to common latent representations for joint analysis. Our method identifies modules of genes with similar expression profiles across different conditions and reveals the role of these modules in disease development and drug response. We demonstrate that disease-relevant genes are enriched in trait-associated modules, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, we apply PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation and identify functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules. Our findings provide a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene expression patterns, which can inform new therapeutic strategies and drug repurposing efforts.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "text": "\nIn recent years, our understanding of disease mechanisms has been revolutionized by advances in functional genomics and genome-wide association studies. However, while single-gene approaches have provided valuable insights into complex traits, they are limited by the fact that many genes act in concert with each other to produce specific outcomes. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene expression data with pharmacological perturbation information to identify key players in disease pathways. Our method maps gene-trait associations and drug effects into a common latent space based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns under different conditions. Using this representation, we find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. We further validate PhenoPLIER by using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and finding that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which can help identify potential therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities. By contextualizing genetic associations with groups of co-expressed genes, our method can uncover new insights into disease etiology and mechanisms that may have been missed by single-gene strategies.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.

              "text": "\nComplex traits are influenced by interactions between multiple genes, which makes determining their etiology and mechanisms challenging. While transcriptome-wide association studies have provided insights into individual gene roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, they do not capture the complex interplay of gene expression patterns across different conditions. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. We demonstrate this by using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, where functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can highlight the importance of complex interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This research advances our understanding of complex traits and provides a valuable tool for identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Context:\nThe current literature on complex traits highlights that modern models predict the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression, but transcriptome-wide association studies have focused on individual genes. Therefore, there is a need for computational approaches that can contextualize genetic associations through groups of co-expressed genes.\n\n1. Content:\nIn this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. We identify modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions and observe that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, highlighting its potential to reveal targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\n1. Conclusion:\nIn conclusion, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations through groups of co-expressed genes, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. This approach has the potential to identify new therapeutic targets and improve our understanding of disease etiology and progression. Future studies should incorporate PhenoPLIER in drug discovery pipelines to uncover drug repurposing opportunities and improve treatment outcomes.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Genes do not function in isolation but interact with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. This requires an understanding of how genes influence complex traits through expression regulation across different conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are crucial for disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By analyzing diseases associated with these modules in relevant cell types, the authors found that their method accurately predicted known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action. Moreover, they used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important players were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's framework provides a new way to interpret genetic associations through the context of gene modules, enabling researchers to identify potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and gain insights into drug mechanisms for complex diseases. This work has significant implications for drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits, and therapeutic target identification in functional genomics studies.",

Traditional approaches that focus on single genes have limitations in uncovering complex disease mechanisms and identifying potential therapeutic targets. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene expression patterns and pharmacological perturbation data to identify functional modules of co-expressed genes. Our method identifies significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, providing accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER by using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and finding that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach has broader significance as it enables us to better understand complex disease mechanisms and identify new therapeutic targets.",

The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

However, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are critical in disease origin and progression, highlighting the need for a more holistic approach to understanding how genes influence complex traits. This is where PhenoPLIER comes in. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Our method identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. Overall, our study highlights the importance of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes in understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

However, there is still much to learn about how genes interact with each other in specific contexts, which can lead to unexpected outcomes. One approach for addressing this challenge is through gene co-expression analysis, which identifies groups of genes that express similarly under different conditions. In this manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. By analyzing the expression patterns of these gene modules in specific cell types, we observed that diseases were significantly associated with relevant gene modules. We also found that our approach was accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. In addition, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important players lacked associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

Functional genomics and gene co-expression analyses can provide valuable insights into expression regulation across different conditions, helping us better understand how genes contribute to complex traits. However, current approaches are limited by their focus on single genes or modules, potentially overlooking important regulatory interactions that may be missed. In this study, we developed a new approach called PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations through the analysis of gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with these modules and that our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lack associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

This highlights the importance of understanding expression regulation across different conditions for developing new therapies. In this study, we demonstrate how gene co-expression analysis can be used to identify disease-associated modules and predict drug repurposing outcomes. We also show that CRISPR screening can prioritize functionally important players missed by single-gene strategies.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

A novel method is needed to contextualize genetic associations and reveal hidden patterns that may be missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nContent: We present a new approach called PhenoPLIER that leverages gene co-expression patterns to identify functional modules associated with complex traits. Using this approach, we analyzed lipid regulation in cell types implicated in various diseases and found that functionally important players were prioritized in trait-associated modules despite lacking direct associations. Additionally, we validated our approach by predicting known drug-disease pairs and identifying potential therapeutic targets. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can accurately contextualize genetic associations and reveal new insights into disease mechanisms.\n\nConclusion: The ability to contextualize genetic associations through the lens of gene modules provides a novel framework for interpreting complex traits and identifying potential drug targets. PhenoPLIER has broader significance in accelerating drug discovery and developing personalized treatments for diseases that involve multiple genes working together.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

This knowledge is critical for developing new therapies that target specific genes and pathways. In this study, we address the gap in the current literature by proposing a novel method called PhenoPLIER that allows us to predict disease associations based on groups of co-expressed genes, rather than single genes. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and reveals potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. We also show that functionally important players can be prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate the power of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into the analysis of genetic associations, providing a novel framework for interpreting complex traits and informing therapeutic strategies.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

However, traditional approaches to gene expression analysis often fail to capture complex interactions between genes, which are critical for understanding how traits are influenced by multiple genetic factors. In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates transcriptome-wide association studies with pharmacological perturbation data to map gene-trait associations and drug mechanisms into a common latent representation. Our method uses modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant cell types and conditions to identify disease-relevant genes and drug targets. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, and show that it is also effective in identifying previously overlooked functional players in lipid regulation by prioritizing them within trait-associated modules. Overall, our work provides a novel framework for analyzing gene expression patterns in complex traits and highlights the importance of gene co-expression in disease etiology and drug discovery.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

However, the mechanisms of how these genes influence complex traits have not yet been fully understood, requiring a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. This knowledge is critical for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Our approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, and we observe that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for complex traits.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

However, existing models have limitations when it comes to capturing the role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that addresses these challenges by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation. This method identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, which allows us to better understand how genes interact in specific contexts. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important players lack associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings provide insights into the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms of complex traits, which may lead to new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing strategies.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

The current models of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. However, determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, there is a need for a computational approach that can map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common representation for joint analysis. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that does just that by mapping gene modules expressed in relevant cell types into latent representations. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrate the importance of functionally important players lacking associations but being prioritized in trait-associated modules by using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides valuable insights into the role of gene expression patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, thereby filling an important gap in the current literature.",

The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
