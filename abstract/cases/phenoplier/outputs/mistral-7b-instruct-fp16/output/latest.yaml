          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          The coordinated activity of genes in specific contexts is essential
          for their functions to be realized. Understanding how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic comprehension of
          expression regulation across different conditions. This insight has
          been shown to be critical for developing new therapies, and
          transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. To address this challenge, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          The study of genes and their functions in specific contexts has been a
          crucial field of research, as it is essential to understand how these
          genes influence complex traits. Traditional methods have focused on
          the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but
          modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant
          role in disease origin and progression. In this study, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations

          enabling us to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. This study fills a gap in
          the literature by introducing a new computational approach that
          improves our understanding of gene expression patterns and their role

          Genes are part of a larger network that works together to perform
          their functions. Understanding how these genes affect complex traits
          requires insight into expression regulation across different
          conditions. This knowledge is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
          identifying the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, but modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play
          a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address this

          to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important
          players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER allows for
          contextualization of genetic associations through the lens of gene
          modules and provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations in complex diseases.

          In recent years, there has been an increasing need to understand the
          complex interplay between genes in specific contexts to elucidate
          disease mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic targets. Traditional
          single-gene studies have limitations in capturing the impact of
          gene-gene interactions on complex traits. To address this gap, we
          developed a novel computational approach called PhenoPLIER that maps
          gene expression data, pharmacological perturbation data, and disease
          associations into a common latent representation based on modules of
          genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
          analysis revealed that diseases are strongly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately
          predicted known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action.
          Moreover, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and
          found that functionally important players were prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, even when they lacked
          individual gene associations. These results demonstrate the potential
          of PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. In conclusion, our
          method provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, which can aid in the
          development of new therapies and the identification of drug
          repurposing opportunities.

          Genes work together in concert to perform their functions, and
          understanding how they influence complex traits is critical for
          developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies
          have identified individual genes involved in disease mechanisms,
          modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant

          Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that
          functionally important players lacked associations but were

          strategies and providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic

          Complex traits are influenced by the coordinated action of multiple
          genes, but understanding how these genes interact to contribute to
          disease development and drug response remains a challenge. This is
          where gene co-expression analysis can be helpful. By analyzing gene
          expression patterns across different conditions, we can identify
          groups of genes that work together in specific contexts to perform
          their functions. However, traditional methods for analyzing gene
          expression data are limited in their ability to capture the complex
          interactions between genes.


          In this manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By
          leveraging modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          different conditions, PhenoPLIER is able to provide a more accurate
          and comprehensive understanding of the relationships between genes and
          complex traits.


          Using PhenoPLIER, we were able to predict known drug-disease pairs and
          infer mechanisms of action, as well as identify potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. We also used a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important players
          lacked associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules
          by PhenoPLIER.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. By
          contextualizing genetic data with gene expression patterns, we can
          gain new insights into disease mechanisms and drug response.

          Gene expression patterns are critical in determining how genes
          influence complex traits and diseases. Understanding the regulatory
          mechanisms of gene expression across different conditions is vital for
          developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies
          have been successful in identifying individual genes associated with
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Therefore, we propose PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. Our approach is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions, which allows us to contextualize genetic associations and
          reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall,
          PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, which can aid in drug
          repurposing and clustering of complex traits.

          Context: The field of genetics has long known that genes interact with
          each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. However,
          determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions. This insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.


          Content: In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observed
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach was accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          found that functionally important players lack associations but were
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


          Conclusion: By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules. Our findings have significant implications for disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms, as well as therapeutic targets and drug

          Gene expression patterns play a critical role in the development and
          progression of complex traits, including diseases. However,
          traditional approaches to gene-gene interactions have limitations, as
          they often focus on individual genes rather than groups of
          co-expressed genes. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for a joint analysis. Our approach is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions, and we observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Our study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach allows
          us to examine how genes work together in specific contexts to perform
          their functions and determine how they influence complex traits.
          Recent research has shown the importance of understanding expression
          regulation across different conditions, particularly for developing
          new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped identify individual genes involved in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, modern models of the architecture of complex traits
          suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
          etiology and progression.


          PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions. Our analysis reveals
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using
          a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our study provides a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules, which can contextualize findings and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. Overall, our work highlights
          the importance of considering gene expression patterns and
          interactions in understanding complex traits and drug mechanisms.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          The study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By
          leveraging the concept of gene modules, which are groups of genes with
          similar expression patterns across different conditions, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.


          The study demonstrates the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER in identifying
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms by analyzing transcriptome-wide
          association studies and CRISPR screens. The results show that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action.


          Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of functional
          genomics and gene co-expression in identifying therapeutic targets for
          complex traits such as lipid regulation. The findings suggest that
          functionally important players may lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


          Overall, the study provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, which can have
          significant implications for drug repurposing and clustering of
          complex traits.

          In recent years, gene expression patterns have been increasingly
          studied to gain insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
          However, the complexity of gene-gene interactions has hindered our
          ability to identify therapeutic targets and mechanisms of action. This
          manuscript introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. Our approach
          identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions, which are then used to contextualize genetic
          associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. We find that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Our results demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER in
          identifying novel therapeutic targets and drug repurposing
          opportunities. Overall, this manuscript provides a valuable
          contribution to the field of functional genomics and gene
          co-expression analysis, highlighting the importance of gene modules in
          understanding disease mechanisms and developing effective therapies.

          Our study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that integrates
          gene expression and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
          latent representation for joint analysis. Gene-gene interactions have
          been shown to play a crucial role in the etiology of complex diseases,
          highlighting the importance of understanding expression regulation
          across different contexts. To address this challenge, we develop
          PhenoPLIER's representation based on modules of genes that exhibit
          similar expression patterns under the same conditions. Our results
          demonstrate that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types and that our approach is highly
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we show that functionally important players lack direct
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, our study provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          which can aid in identifying potential therapeutic targets and drug
          repurposing strategies.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that links gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data to a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. Genes act together in specific
          contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic comprehension of
          expression regulation across various conditions. Previous research has
          demonstrated the importance of this insight in developing new
          therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
          reveal individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a critical role in disease etiology and progression.
          In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, which is based on modules of
          genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We
          find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules, which can contextualize these
          associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. Our approach has significant implications for therapeutic
          target discovery and drug repurposing, as it allows us to identify
          clusters of complex traits that are not apparent in single-gene
          studies.

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          The study presents PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. The
          manuscript highlights the importance of understanding how genes
          collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions. It notes
          that modern models of complex trait architecture predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease development and
          progression. The authors demonstrate that their approach, which is
          based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          relevant conditions, accurately identifies diseases associated with
          specific cell types. Furthermore, they show that PhenoPLIER can
          accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of
          action. Lastly, the study highlights how PhenoPLIER can identify
          functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in
          trait-associated modules, providing a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. Overall, this
          manuscript presents an innovative approach to analyzing genetic
          associations and reveals potential drug targets that may have been
          overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          The field of genetic studies has greatly benefited from functional
          genomics, but there is still a gap in our understanding of how genes
          interact with each other to influence complex traits. Recent
          transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models
          predict that gene-gene interactions are crucial for disease origin and
          progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          shared latent space for joint analysis. Gene expression patterns are
          crucial in determining how genes collaborate to perform specific
          functions in different contexts. Understanding the regulatory
          mechanisms underlying these expression patterns is critical for
          developing new treatments. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          been instrumental in identifying individual genes associated with
          disease-relevant processes. However, modern models of complex trait
          architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is
          based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
          same conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly
          associated with modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, even when they
          lack direct associations. In conclusion, by integrating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          contextualizing genetic associations and identifying potential drug
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. This method enables us to
          interpret genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          providing valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          In the field of functional genomics, gene expression patterns have
          been shown to be closely linked to disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. However, the complexity of these relationships has made it
          challenging to identify specific genetic associations that play a role
          in disease development and progression. To address this gap, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that uses gene
          co-expression patterns to map gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. By combining groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of disease mechanisms and drug
          mechanisms. We demonstrate that our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action by observing
          significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types. Furthermore, we use PhenoPLIER to identify
          functionally important players in lipid regulation that lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our
          results highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER as a powerful tool for
          identifying therapeutic targets and drug repurposing strategies.
          Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel and valuable approach to
          projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns,
          which can significantly enhance our understanding of disease etiology
          and drug mechanisms.

          The coordinated function of genes is crucial for performing their

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          In the field of functional genomics, it is well established that genes
          interact in specific contexts to perform their functions. However,
          understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          deeper understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions. While this insight has shown promise for developing new
          therapies, there remains a gap in our ability to accurately predict
          disease associations and infer mechanisms of action through the
          analysis of gene expression patterns. In this study, we sought to fill
          this gap by projecting genetic associations through gene expression
          patterns. Specifically, we used clustering algorithms to identify
          groups of co-expressed genes that are associated with specific complex
          traits. Our approach was successful in accurately predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          we applied a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that
          functionally important players were prioritized in trait-associated
          modules despite lacking significant associations. Taken together, our
          results demonstrate the value of incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes in the analysis of genetic associations, as this approach can
          contextualize these associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. As such, PhenoPLIER provides a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules, which has broader significance for drug discovery and
          precision medicine.

          action. Furthermore, we show that PhenoPLIER, a novel clustering
          algorithm, can prioritize functionally important players in
          trait-associated modules even when they lack direct associations. This
          highlights the potential of gene modules as therapeutic targets for
          disease repurposing and drug discovery. Overall, our findings provide
          a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
          of functional genomics, which can lead to more effective treatments
          for complex diseases.

          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          The complex interplay of genes in specific contexts is essential for
          understanding their functions and how they contribute to complex
          traits. Determining the precise regulation of gene expression across
          different conditions is critical for developing new therapies. In this
          study, we sought to elucidate the association between genes and
          complex traits by integrating groups of co-expressed genes into our
          analysis pipeline. Using PhenoPLIER, we identified disease-associated
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types with high accuracy.
          Moreover, our approach accurately predicted known drug-disease pairs
          and inferred mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we used a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, revealing that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings provide a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules, enabling contextualization and identification of
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can reveal the underlying
          mechanisms of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, providing valuable
          insights into therapeutic targets and drug repurposing for complex
          traits.

          Genetic associations with complex traits are challenging to interpret
          due to the intricate network of gene interactions. Functional genomics
          techniques, such as gene co-expression analysis, have emerged as a
          promising approach to uncovering disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
          However, existing methods lack the ability to contextualize genetic
          associations by considering groups of co-expressed genes. In this
          study, we developed PhenoPLIER, a novel tool that integrates gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types to predict known drug-disease
          pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Our results show that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in specific
          contexts. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we found that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations and uncovering potential therapeutic targets missed by
          single-gene strategies.

          In this study, we demonstrate the importance of understanding gene
          expression patterns in identifying disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. We show that diseases are significantly associated with
          specific groups of co-expressed genes in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is able to accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and
          infer potential mechanisms of action. Our findings also reveal that
          functionally important players may lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, a CRISPR screen
          analysis tool. Overall, our results highlight the value of
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes in interpreting genetic
          associations and uncovering potential therapeutic targets missed by
          single-gene strategies.

          Gene expression patterns have emerged as a powerful tool for
          understanding the complex interplay of genes in disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms. Despite extensive genetic studies, the mechanistic
          regulation of gene expression across different conditions remains
          poorly understood. Our study addresses this gap by investigating how
          diseases are associated with specific groups of co-expressed genes in
          relevant cell types.


          To achieve this, we developed a novel approach called PhenoPLIER that
          integrates gene expression data with functional genomics information
          to identify disease-associated modules. We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using CRISPR screens to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.


          Our results show that by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules has
          significant implications for therapeutic target identification and
          drug repurposing.


          In conclusion, our study provides a valuable resource for researchers
          seeking to better understand the complex interplay of genes in disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms. The PhenoPLIER approach can facilitate
          clustering of complex traits and inform therapeutic strategies aimed
          at modulating gene expression patterns.

          Our manuscript presents a novel approach for understanding genetic
          associations by analyzing gene expression patterns across various
          conditions. We show that genes act in concert with each other to
          perform complex functions, and that their influence on traits requires
          an understanding of expression regulation. Our study reveals that
          disease etiology can be predicted through the analysis of gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is highly accurate
          in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, revealing that functionally
          important players may not have direct associations with traits but can
          still be prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our results provide
          a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the
          lens of gene modules, which can help inform therapeutic strategies and
          drug repurposing efforts.

          The context of this manuscript is the complex interplay between genes
          and how they influence various traits. It highlights the importance of
          understanding gene expression regulation across different conditions,
          particularly in the development of new therapies. The open question
          that this research addresses is how to accurately predict disease
          associations and infer mechanisms of action through groups of
          co-expressed genes.


          To fill this gap, we have developed a novel approach called
          PhenoPLIER, which integrates gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types to contextualize genetic associations. Our results show that
          diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, we have used a CRISPR screen
          to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important
          players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER.


          In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that by incorporating groups
          of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
          associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. This novel framework provides a powerful tool for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          which has broad implications for drug repurposing and clustering of
          complex traits.

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes play a critical role in the development and progression of
          complex traits. However, determining their influence on these traits
          requires a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation under
          different conditions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          revealed the contribution of individual genes to disease mechanisms.
          However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
          vital role in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. The representation is
          based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
          same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation and observe that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Our study highlights the importance of gene co-expression
          in disease etiology and drug mechanism discovery and provides insights
          into therapeutic targets for complex traits. Keywords: genetic
          studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets,

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Genetic studies have shown that genes work together to perform
          specific functions, but understanding how these genes influence
          complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across different conditions. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
          in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the architecture of
          complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in disease origin and progression. In this manuscript, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. Our approach is based on modules of
          genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions and
          observes that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of

          that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, our
          work highlights the importance of gene expression patterns in disease
          etiology and drug mechanism, and provides a valuable tool for
          identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs.

          The study of genetic associations through gene expression patterns has
          emerged as an important area in the field of functional genomics and
          disease etiology. This approach involves identifying groups of genes
          that exhibit coordinated expression patterns under different
          conditions, which can provide insights into the mechanisms underlying
          complex traits. The authors introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational tool that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data to identify gene modules associated
          with disease etiology and drug response mechanisms. By leveraging
          functional genomics techniques such as clustering of complex traits,
          the study identifies key players in lipid regulation that lack direct
          genetic associations but are prioritized by PhenoPLIER based on their
          co-expression patterns with known disease-associated genes. These
          findings demonstrate the importance of considering gene expression
          patterns and functional genomics data in understanding the underlying
          mechanisms of complex traits and identifying potential therapeutic
          targets for drug repurposing.

          Genetic associations and functional genomics are essential for
          understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However, the
          complexity of trait-gene interactions has limited our ability to
          identify therapeutic targets and repurpose drugs. This manuscript
          presents PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages
          gene expression patterns to map gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data. By clustering genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions, PhenoPLIER identifies
          disease-associated modules and predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players
          lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Our findings highlight the importance of gene expression
          patterns in identifying disease etiology and drug mechanisms and
          provide a useful tool for drug repurposing and clustering complex
          traits.

          Understanding the complex interactions between genes in specific
          contexts is crucial for unraveling disease mechanisms and identifying
          novel therapeutic targets. Although previous studies have identified
          individual genes associated with disease, recent models of complex
          trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a critical
          role in disease onset and progression. In this study, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. By leveraging modules of
          genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, we
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with
          trait-specific gene modules and accurately predict known drug-disease
          pairs and their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we show that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          disease-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our study provides valuable
          insights into the role of gene co-expression patterns in disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms, which could inform novel therapeutic
          strategies and accelerate drug repurposing efforts.

          The understanding of how genes act in concert with each other to
          perform their functions is crucial for the development of new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
          uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms,
          modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and
          progression. However, these interactions are difficult to detect using
          current methods. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a

          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation

          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in

          The study highlights the importance of understanding gene expression
          patterns and their role in complex traits. Genetic studies and
          functional genomics have helped uncover the mechanisms underlying
          disease development and progression, but modern models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are crucial. The proposed computational
          approach, PhenoPLIER, is designed to map gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a latent representation for
          joint analysis. Based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across conditions, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts
          drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Additionally, the study
          found that functionally important players were prioritized in
          trait-associated modules despite lacking direct associations using a
          CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation. Overall, this research
          provides valuable insights into the role of gene expression patterns
          in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, potentially paving the way
          for new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing strategies.

          In the field of functional genomics, it is well established that genes
          act in concert with each other to perform their functions. Determining
          how these genes influence complex traits and disease mechanisms
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex

          patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms and suggest that the

          therapeutic targets for complex diseases.

          This manuscript presents a novel computational approach, PhenoPLIER,
          that identifies gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data by mapping them into a common latent representation.
          This approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions, which allows for a joint analysis
          of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. The results show that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known

          a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in

          and how this knowledge can inform the development of new therapies and

          Understanding the intricate ways in which genes interact with each
          other is essential for developing effective therapies. Traditional
          approaches to studying complex traits have relied on analyzing
          individual gene expression patterns, but recent research suggests that
          gene-gene interactions are critical for disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns
          across the same conditions. Our results show that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, we demonstrate the usefulness
          of our approach by using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation
          and identifying functionally important players that lack associations
          but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Overall, PhenoPLIER
          highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms and provides a valuable tool for
          therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing.

            contributions from the current state of the art by communicating
            what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
            that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the

            section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field

              The coordinated activity of genes in specific contexts is
              essential for their functions to be realized. Understanding how
              these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
              comprehension of expression regulation across different
              conditions. This insight has been shown to be critical for
              developing new therapies, and transcriptome-wide association
              studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. To address this challenge, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions, and we observe that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our
              approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen

              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. This suggests that by incorporating groups
              of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, providing new insights into disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms. Keywords: genetic studies, functional genomics, gene

              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and

              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent

              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. We show that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, we use a CRISPR

              important players lack associations but are prioritized in

              In recent years, there has been an increasing need to understand
              the complex interplay between genes in specific contexts to
              elucidate disease mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic
              targets. Traditional single-gene studies have limitations in
              capturing the impact of gene-gene interactions on complex traits.
              To address this gap, we developed a novel computational approach
              called PhenoPLIER that maps gene expression data, pharmacological
              perturbation data, and disease associations into a common latent
              representation based on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions. Our analysis revealed that
              diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicted known
              drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action. Moreover, we
              used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that
              functionally important players were prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, even when they lacked
              individual gene associations. These results demonstrate the
              potential of PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. In
              conclusion, our method provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which can
              aid in the development of new therapies and the identification of
              drug repurposing opportunities.

              Complex traits are influenced by the coordinated action of
              multiple genes, but understanding how these genes interact to
              contribute to disease development and drug response remains a
              challenge. This is where gene co-expression analysis can be
              helpful. By analyzing gene expression patterns across different
              conditions, we can identify groups of genes that work together in
              specific contexts to perform their functions. However, traditional
              methods for analyzing gene expression data are limited in their
              ability to capture the complex interactions between genes.


              In this manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. By leveraging modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across different conditions, PhenoPLIER is able to
              provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the
              relationships between genes and complex traits.


              Using PhenoPLIER, we were able to predict known drug-disease pairs
              and infer mechanisms of action, as well as identify potential
              targets missed by single-gene strategies. We also used a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally
              important players lacked associations but were prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules. By contextualizing genetic data with gene expression
              patterns, we can gain new insights into disease mechanisms and
              drug response.

            Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to
            perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
            complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
            regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this
            insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
            same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
            analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of
            co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
            associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene
            strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
            genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              Gene expression patterns are critical in determining how genes
              influence complex traits and diseases. Understanding the
              regulatory mechanisms of gene expression across different
              conditions is vital for developing new therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in
              identifying individual genes associated with disease-relevant
              mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play
              a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Therefore, we
              propose PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. Our approach is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions, which allows us to contextualize genetic associations
              and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Additionally, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation and find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, which can aid in drug repurposing and clustering of
              complex traits.

              Context: The field of genetics has long known that genes interact
              with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.
              However, determining how these genes influence complex traits
              requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions. This insight is critical for
              developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
              architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
              play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.


              Content: In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We
              observed that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach was
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important
              players lack associations but were prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER.


              Conclusion: By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
              provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules. Our findings have significant
              implications for disease etiology and drug mechanisms, as well as
              therapeutic targets and drug repurposing.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Our study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This approach allows us to examine how genes work
              together in specific contexts to perform their functions and
              determine how they influence complex traits. Recent research has
              shown the importance of understanding expression regulation across
              different conditions, particularly for developing new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify
              individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern
              models of the architecture of complex traits suggest that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and
              progression.


              PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
              analysis reveals that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. Our study provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which can
              contextualize findings and reveal potential targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. Overall, our work highlights the
              importance of considering gene expression patterns and
              interactions in understanding complex traits and drug mechanisms.

              The study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint

              conditions, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.


              The study demonstrates the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER in
              identifying disease etiology and drug mechanisms by analyzing
              transcriptome-wide association studies and CRISPR screens. The

              for complex traits such as lipid regulation. The findings suggest

              In recent years, gene expression patterns have been increasingly
              studied to gain insights into disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms. However, the complexity of gene-gene interactions has
              hindered our ability to identify therapeutic targets and
              mechanisms of action. This manuscript introduces PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. Our approach identifies modules
              of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions, which are then used to contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. We find that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results demonstrate
              the utility of PhenoPLIER in identifying novel therapeutic targets
              and drug repurposing opportunities. Overall, this manuscript
              provides a valuable contribution to the field of functional
              genomics and gene co-expression analysis, highlighting the
              importance of gene modules in understanding disease mechanisms and
              developing effective therapies.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence

              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of

              Our study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that
              integrates gene expression and pharmacological perturbation data
              into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. Gene-gene
              interactions have been shown to play a crucial role in the
              etiology of complex diseases, highlighting the importance of
              understanding expression regulation across different contexts. To
              address this challenge, we develop PhenoPLIER's representation
              based on modules of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns
              under the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases
              are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types and that our approach is highly accurate in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Using
              a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we show that
              functionally important players lack direct associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, our study provides a novel framework for interpreting

              aid in identifying potential therapeutic targets and drug

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that links
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data to a
              common latent representation for joint analysis. Genes act
              together in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and
              understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
              mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various
              conditions. Previous research has demonstrated the importance of
              this insight in developing new therapies. Although
              transcriptome-wide association studies have helped reveal
              individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern
              models of the architecture of complex traits predict that

              and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, which is

              The field of genetic studies has greatly benefited from functional
              genomics, but there is still a gap in our understanding of how
              genes interact with each other to influence complex traits. Recent
              transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of
              individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models
              predict that gene-gene interactions are crucial for disease origin
              and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. By analyzing modules of genes
              with similar expression patterns across the same conditions,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results
              show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework
              for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a shared latent space for joint analysis. Gene expression patterns
              are crucial in determining how genes collaborate to perform
              specific functions in different contexts. Understanding the
              regulatory mechanisms underlying these expression patterns is
              critical for developing new treatments. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been instrumental in identifying
              individual genes associated with disease-relevant processes.
              However, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of

              Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with

              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms

              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, even when
              they lack direct associations. In conclusion, by integrating
              groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel
              framework for contextualizing genetic associations and identifying
              potential drug targets missed by single-gene strategies. This

              In the field of functional genomics, gene expression patterns have
              been shown to be closely linked to disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms. However, the complexity of these relationships has
              made it challenging to identify specific genetic associations that
              play a role in disease development and progression. To address
              this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              uses gene co-expression patterns to map gene-trait associations
              and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent

              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of disease
              mechanisms and drug mechanisms. We demonstrate that our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action by observing significant associations between diseases
              and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, we

              regulation that lack associations but are prioritized in

              PhenoPLIER as a powerful tool for identifying therapeutic targets
              and drug repurposing strategies. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a

              our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

            concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
            functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
            requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
            different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's
            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
            patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
            significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
            cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
            drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
            using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
            functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
            in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
            incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
            contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
            missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel
            framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of

              The coordinated function of genes is crucial for performing their
              functions in specific contexts, and understanding how these genes
              influence complex traits requires an insight into expression
              regulation across different conditions. In this study, we show
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules

              In the field of functional genomics, it is well established that
              genes interact in specific contexts to perform their functions.
              However, understanding how these genes influence complex traits
              requires a deeper understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions. While this insight has shown promise for
              developing new therapies, there remains a gap in our ability to
              accurately predict disease associations and infer mechanisms of
              action through the analysis of gene expression patterns. In this
              study, we sought to fill this gap by projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns. Specifically, we
              used clustering algorithms to identify groups of co-expressed
              genes that are associated with specific complex traits. Our
              approach was successful in accurately predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, we applied a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation and found that functionally important players were
              prioritized in trait-associated modules despite lacking
              significant associations. Taken together, our results demonstrate
              the value of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes in the
              analysis of genetic associations, as this approach can
              contextualize these associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. As such, PhenoPLIER provides a
              novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the
              lens of gene modules, which has broader significance for drug
              discovery and precision medicine.

              Our study highlights the importance of gene expression patterns in

              The complex interplay of genes in specific contexts is essential

              Genes function in coordination with each other to execute their
              roles. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
              requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different contexts. This knowledge is crucial for
              developing new therapies. Our study demonstrates that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              we found that functionally important players lack associations but
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, a
              CRISPR screen that analyzed lipid regulation. In conclusion,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal

              Genetic associations with complex traits are challenging to
              interpret due to the intricate network of gene interactions.
              Functional genomics techniques, such as gene co-expression
              analysis, have emerged as a promising approach to uncovering
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However, existing methods
              lack the ability to contextualize genetic associations by
              considering groups of co-expressed genes. In this study, we
              developed PhenoPLIER, a novel tool that integrates gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types to predict known drug-disease
              pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Our results show that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in specific contexts. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of

              interpreting genetic associations and uncovering potential

              Gene expression patterns have emerged as a powerful tool for
              understanding the complex interplay of genes in disease etiology
              and drug mechanisms. Despite extensive genetic studies, the
              mechanistic regulation of gene expression across different
              conditions remains poorly understood. Our study addresses this gap
              by investigating how diseases are associated with specific groups
              of co-expressed genes in relevant cell types.


              To achieve this, we developed a novel approach called PhenoPLIER
              that integrates gene expression data with functional genomics
              information to identify disease-associated modules. We demonstrate
              that PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using CRISPR
              screens to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              Our results show that by incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This
              novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the
              lens of gene modules has significant implications for therapeutic
              target identification and drug repurposing.


              In conclusion, our study provides a valuable resource for
              researchers seeking to better understand the complex interplay of
              genes in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. The PhenoPLIER
              approach can facilitate clustering of complex traits and inform
              therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating gene expression
              patterns.

              Our manuscript presents a novel approach for understanding genetic
              associations by analyzing gene expression patterns across various
              conditions. We show that genes act in concert with each other to
              perform complex functions, and that their influence on traits
              requires an understanding of expression regulation. Our study
              reveals that disease etiology can be predicted through the
              analysis of gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach is highly accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrate
              the utility of using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation,
              revealing that functionally important players may not have direct
              associations with traits but can still be prioritized in

              The context of this manuscript is the complex interplay between
              genes and how they influence various traits. It highlights the
              importance of understanding gene expression regulation across
              different conditions, particularly in the development of new
              therapies. The open question that this research addresses is how
              to accurately predict disease associations and infer mechanisms of
              action through groups of co-expressed genes.


              To fill this gap, we have developed a novel approach called
              PhenoPLIER, which integrates gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types to contextualize genetic associations. Our results show
              that diseases are significantly associated with these gene
              modules, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover,
              we have used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found
              that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that by incorporating
              groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. This novel framework provides a powerful tool for
              interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, which has broad implications for drug repurposing and
              clustering of complex traits.

              Genes play a critical role in the development and progression of
              complex traits. However, determining their influence on these
              traits requires a comprehensive understanding of expression
              regulation under different conditions. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have revealed the contribution of individual
              genes to disease mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that
              gene-gene interactions play a vital role in disease etiology and
              progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. The representation is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Additionally, we use a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation and observe that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. Our study highlights the importance of gene
              co-expression in disease etiology and drug mechanism discovery and
              provides insights into therapeutic targets for complex traits.

              Genetic studies have shown that genes work together to perform
              specific functions, but understanding how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression

              The study of genetic associations through gene expression patterns
              has emerged as an important area in the field of functional
              genomics and disease etiology. This approach involves identifying
              groups of genes that exhibit coordinated expression patterns under
              different conditions, which can provide insights into the
              mechanisms underlying complex traits. The authors introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational tool that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data to identify
              gene modules associated with disease etiology and drug response
              mechanisms. By leveraging functional genomics techniques such as
              clustering of complex traits, the study identifies key players in
              lipid regulation that lack direct genetic associations but are
              prioritized by PhenoPLIER based on their co-expression patterns
              with known disease-associated genes. These findings demonstrate
              the importance of considering gene expression patterns and
              functional genomics data in understanding the underlying
              mechanisms of complex traits and identifying potential therapeutic
              targets for drug repurposing.

              Genetic associations and functional genomics are essential for
              understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However, the
              complexity of trait-gene interactions has limited our ability to
              identify therapeutic targets and repurpose drugs. This manuscript
              presents PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that leverages
              gene expression patterns to map gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data. By clustering genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions, PhenoPLIER
              identifies disease-associated modules and predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and their mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that
              functionally important players lacking associations were
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our
              findings highlight the importance of gene expression patterns in
              identifying disease etiology and drug mechanisms and provide a
              useful tool for drug repurposing and clustering complex traits.

              Understanding the complex interactions between genes in specific
              contexts is crucial for unraveling disease mechanisms and
              identifying novel therapeutic targets. Although previous studies
              have identified individual genes associated with disease, recent
              models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a critical role in disease onset and

              The study highlights the importance of understanding gene
              expression patterns and their role in complex traits. Genetic
              studies and functional genomics have helped uncover the mechanisms
              underlying disease development and progression, but modern models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial. The proposed
              computational approach, PhenoPLIER, is designed to map gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a latent
              representation for joint analysis. Based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across conditions, PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, the study found that functionally important players
              were prioritized in trait-associated modules despite lacking
              direct associations using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into
              the role of gene expression patterns in disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms, potentially paving the way for new therapeutic targets
              and drug repurposing strategies.

              In the field of functional genomics, it is well established that
              genes act in concert with each other to perform their functions.
              Determining how these genes influence complex traits and disease
              mechanisms requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of

              modules expressed in relevant cell types, we demonstrate that
              PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR

              important players lack associations but are prioritized in

              Understanding the intricate ways in which genes interact with each
              other is essential for developing effective therapies. Traditional
              approaches to studying complex traits have relied on analyzing
              individual gene expression patterns, but recent research suggests
              that gene-gene interactions are critical for disease etiology and
              drug mechanisms. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
