Genes collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression.

In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we observe functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of groups of co-expressed genes contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

The abstract has been revised to enhance clarity, concision and scientific language:

Genes cooperate in specific contexts to carry out their functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions. This insight is crucial for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the onset and progression of diseases. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns in identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.

Genes perform their functions by working together in specific contexts. To understand how these genes influence complex traits, we need to study the regulation of gene expression across various conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and progression. We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, enabling accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs and inferences about mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking direct associations are prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules.","[PASS] (1.00) In the complex landscape of genetic studies, understanding how genes interact to influence diseases and traits remains a significant challenge. While transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual gene contributions, modern models emphasize the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER—a computational approach that combines gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a joint latent representation based on co-expressed gene modules. Our results demonstrate significant associations between diseases and module expression patterns in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease relationships and mechanisms of action. Moreover, through the analysis of lipid regulation using CRISPR screens, we show that PhenoPLIER can identify functionally important genes lacking direct associations, thus highlighting its potential for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing strategies.","genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits","Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.
