 Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is critical for elucidating how these genes influence complex traits and developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease etiology and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important genes lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Therefore, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

 The study of how genes influence complex traits requires a comprehensive understanding of their expression regulation in specific contexts. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we show that functionally important players lacking individual gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting its potential to reveal targets missed by single-gene strategies. Therefore, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, contextualizing these associations and revealing potential therapeutic targets in complex traits. This approach has broader significance for understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms, enabling more effective drug repurposing and functional genomics studies.">[FAIL] (0.91) Expected output to contain "CRISPR"

 Genes operate in conjunction with one another within specific contexts to execute their functions. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is critical for deciphering how these genes influence complex traits and developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action.

 Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is crucial for elucidating how these genes influence complex traits, which is critical for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have significantly contributed to uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression.

In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferrs mechanisms of action.

Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lacking individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets that might have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. Therefore, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby providing insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

 In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for joint analysis. Genes function in the context of complex networks, and understanding how they collectively regulate expression across various conditions is essential to elucidate their influence on complex traits. This knowledge is critical for developing effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern trait architecture models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression.

PhenoPLIER's innovative representation relies on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions.

 In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for comprehensive analysis.

 In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent space for joint analysis. Genes function in the context of intricate networks, executing their roles through coordinated expression regulation across various conditions. A mechanistic understanding of these expression patterns is critical for elucidating complex trait etiology and developing effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene-disease associations, recent genetic research highlights the importance of gene-gene interactions in shaping disease architecture.

Leveraging gene co-expression patterns across comparable conditions, PhenoPLIER represents gene modules to identify significant connections between these modules and diseases within relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, through the analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, we demonstrate that functionally important genes, which may lack individual gene-trait associations, are effectively prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups enables the contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that might be overlooked by conventional single-gene strategies. Our methodology offers a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, facilitating advancements in both functional genomics and therapeutic target discovery.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering individual gene-trait associations, they fall short in capturing the intricate gene-gene interactions that underlie disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space for joint analysis. This integration is based on gene co-expression modules, which are derived from genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking individual gene-trait associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

 Genes operate in coordination with one another within specific contexts to execute their functions. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates insight into expression regulation across diverse conditions. This knowledge is vital for the development of novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern architectural models of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that amalgamates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is derived from modules of genes with comparable expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, through the utilization of a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important elements, which lack individual associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in identifying individual genes associated with disease-relevant mechanisms, they do not account for the crucial role that gene-gene interactions play in disease etiology and progression.
