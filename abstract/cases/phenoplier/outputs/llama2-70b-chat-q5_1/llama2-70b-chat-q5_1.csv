Genes coordinate their expression in a concerted manner to execute their functions, and understanding how they contribute to complex traits requires a comprehensive analysis of gene regulation across diverse conditions. Recent studies have demonstrated that elucidating the mechanisms of gene expression is essential for developing novel therapeutic strategies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, the latest models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in the development and progression of complex diseases. To address this challenge, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation, enabling a joint analysis of gene expression patterns and drug mechanisms. Our method is based on modules of genes with similar expression profiles across relevant conditions, which are prioritized based on their functional significance in disease-relevant cell types. We observe that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and inferences mechanisms of action, as well as identifying functionally important players that lack genetic associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. By incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach provides a valuable tool for understanding the complex interplay between genes and their role in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately facilitating the discovery of new therapeutic strategies.","[FAIL] (0.88) Expected output to contain ""CRISPR""

Genes coordinately act in specific contexts to execute their functions. However, understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions. This knowledge is essential for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and progression. To address this challenge, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation, enabling a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our approach identifies disease-relevant gene modules expressed in appropriate cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action. Notably, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.","[FAIL] (0.88) Expected output to contain ""CRISPR""

Genes coordinate their functions in specific contexts, and understanding how they contribute to complex traits requires a mechanistic grasp of expression regulation across diverse conditions. This insight is crucial for developing novel therapies, as demonstrated by previous studies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a key role in disease origins and progression. To address this challenge, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation, enabling a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferences mechanisms of action. Notably, a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation reveals that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Revised abstract:

Uncovering the genetic basis of complex traits requires a comprehensive understanding of gene expression patterns and their relationship to disease mechanisms. PhenoPLIER, our novel computational approach, maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation, enabling a joint analysis of gene expression patterns and drug mechanisms. By integrating modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions, PhenoPLIER identifies significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in specific cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferences mechanisms of action, as demonstrated by a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players in trait-associated modules, providing new insights into disease etiology and therapeutic targets. This study highlights the potential of PhenoPLIER for identifying novel drug mechanisms and repurposing drugs for complex diseases.","[PASS] (1.00) 
Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions, but understanding how they influence complex traits requires a deep dive into expression regulation across different conditions. This knowledge is critical for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Our computational approach, PhenoPLIER, maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We found that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferences mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting the power of our approach in identifying potential therapeutic targets. By filling this gap in our understanding of complex traits, our research opens up new avenues for drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits, advancing the field of functional genomics.","genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits","Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.
