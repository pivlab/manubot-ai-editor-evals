          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits is crucial
          for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease
          mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are also
          important in disease origin and progression. In this study, we

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genetic studies have shown that genes work together in specific
          contexts to influence complex traits, highlighting the need for a
          mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
          different conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies
          have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are crucial for disease origin and progression.
          In this manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression

          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known

          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules, revealing potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies and advancing the understanding of disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms in the context of gene co-expression and

          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant
          role in disease origin and progression. In this study, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
          associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies, offering a promising approach for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and
          advancing the field of functional genomics.

          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          Genetic studies and functional genomics have provided valuable
          insights into the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, but
          the contribution of gene-gene interactions in complex traits remains a
          critical gap in our understanding. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a

          cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, our analysis of
          lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen reveals that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes
          genetic associations and uncovers potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a new framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genetic studies and functional genomics have provided valuable
          insights into the mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases.
          However, a critical gap in the current literature is the lack of a
          comprehensive approach to integrate gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data for a joint analysis. Here we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This approach is
          based on the concept that genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions, and understanding how
          these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.
          Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of
          PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework
          for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules
          and advancing the field of drug repurposing and therapeutic target
          identification.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for joint analysis. Genes work together
          in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding
          how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.
          This insight is crucial for the development of new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of
          complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are
          also critical in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. We have observed that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, our analysis of
          lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen reveals that functionally
          important players lacking associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by

          genetic associations and uncovers potential targets missed by

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          Genetic studies and functional genomics have provided valuable
          insights into the mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases.
          However, a gap remains in our understanding of how gene-gene
          interactions contribute to disease etiology and drug mechanisms. To
          address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. By
          identifying modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          different conditions, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations
          and reveals potential therapeutic targets that may be missed by
          single-gene strategies. Our analysis demonstrates that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of gene
          co-expression in understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms,
          and PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, with implications for
          drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.

          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genetic studies and functional genomics have provided valuable
          insights into the mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases.
          However, a gap remains in our understanding of how gene-gene
          interactions contribute to disease etiology and drug mechanisms. To
          address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. By
          identifying modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          different conditions, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations
          and reveals potential therapeutic targets that may be missed by
          single-gene strategies. Our analysis demonstrates that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, our approach prioritizes
          functionally important players in trait-associated modules, as
          evidenced by our analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen.
          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for projecting
          genetic associations through gene expression patterns, highlighting
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and offering new opportunities
          for drug repurposing and the clustering of complex traits.

          Genetic studies have shown that understanding the interplay between
          genes in specific contexts is crucial for unraveling the mechanisms
          underlying complex traits and diseases. However, there is a need for a
          method that can accurately project genetic associations through gene
          expression patterns to highlight disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
          Here we present our novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which identifies gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types that are significantly
          associated with diseases. Our results demonstrate the accuracy of
          PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, our use of a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation reveals that functionally important players
          lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for
          contextualizing genetic associations and uncovering potential
          therapeutic targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. This
          approach has broader significance in advancing functional genomics and
          drug repurposing by providing a more comprehensive understanding of
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions. This insight is crucial for the development of new

          using a CRISPR screen reveals that functionally important players lack

          co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          Genetic studies and functional genomics have shown that understanding
          the interplay of genes in specific contexts is crucial for unraveling
          the mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases. However, there
          is a need for a method that can accurately project genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns to highlight disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms. Here we present our novel approach,
          PhenoPLIER, which identifies gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types that are significantly associated with diseases. Our results
          demonstrate that PhenoPLIER is effective in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          our analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen reveals that
          functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, our findings
          highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic
          associations and uncover potential therapeutic targets that may be
          missed by single-gene strategies, providing a new framework for
          interpreting genetic associations and advancing drug repurposing and
          therapeutic target identification in the field of precision medicine.

          new therapies. In this study, we demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, our use of a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation reveals that functionally important
          players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, our novel framework, PhenoPLIER,
          incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic
          associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies, providing a valuable tool for interpreting genetic
          associations and advancing the field of functional genomics.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          Genetic studies have shown that understanding how genes work together
          in specific contexts is crucial for unraveling the mechanisms behind
          complex traits and diseases. However, there is a need for a more
          accurate and comprehensive approach to identify therapeutic targets
          and mechanisms of action. In this study, we introduce a novel method,
          PhenoPLIER, which utilizes gene co-expression patterns to project
          genetic associations onto disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our
          results demonstrate that diseases are significantly linked to gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, our analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen
          reveals that functionally important players lacking associations are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, our
          findings highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER to contextualize
          genetic associations and uncover potential targets that may be missed
          by traditional single-gene strategies, providing a new framework for
          interpreting genetic associations and advancing the field of
          functional genomics and drug repurposing.

          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is

          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the

          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated

          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack

          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genetic studies have shown that understanding how genes work together
          in specific contexts is crucial for unraveling the mechanisms behind
          complex traits and diseases. However, there is a need for a more
          accurate and comprehensive approach to predicting therapeutic targets
          and drug mechanisms. In this study, we introduce a novel method,
          PhenoPLIER, which utilizes gene co-expression patterns to project
          genetic associations and highlight disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, our analysis of lipid regulation
          using a CRISPR screen reveals that functionally important players
          lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Overall, our findings suggest that PhenoPLIER provides a
          valuable framework for contextualizing genetic associations and
          identifying potential targets that may be missed by single-gene
          strategies, thus advancing the field of functional genomics and drug
          repurposing.

          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data to identify common patterns of gene expression across different
          conditions. Our analysis reveals that diseases are closely linked to
          specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to study
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important genes, which
          lack direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules
          by PhenoPLIER. This novel approach not only highlights the importance
          of gene co-expression in disease etiology and drug mechanisms but also
          provides a valuable tool for drug repurposing and identifying
          therapeutic targets.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our

          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by

          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          Genetic studies have shown that understanding how genes work together
          in specific contexts is crucial for uncovering disease etiology and
          identifying potential therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have provided valuable insights into the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models of complex
          traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are also key players in
          disease progression. In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a
          novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data to identify common patterns of
          gene expression across different conditions. Our analysis reveals that
          diseases are closely linked to specific gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we demonstrate that
          functionally important genes, which may lack direct associations, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This work not
          only fills a gap in the current literature by highlighting the
          importance of gene co-expression in disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms, but also provides a valuable tool for drug repurposing and
          identifying therapeutic targets.

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of their expression regulation across
          different conditions. This insight is crucial for the development of
          new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are also critical in disease origin and
          progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings
          show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          Genetic studies have shown that understanding how genes work together
          in specific contexts is crucial for uncovering disease etiology and
          identifying potential therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have provided valuable insights into the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models of complex
          traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are also key players in
          disease progression. In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a
          novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data to identify common patterns of
          gene expression across different conditions. Our analysis reveals that
          diseases are closely linked to specific gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          our use of a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation demonstrates that
          functionally important genes, which may lack individual associations,
          are prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER.
          This work not only fills a gap in current research by highlighting the
          importance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms, but also provides a valuable tool for identifying
          potential therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genetic studies have shown that understanding how genes work together
          in specific contexts is crucial for uncovering disease etiology and
          identifying potential therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have provided valuable insights into the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models of complex
          traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are also key players in
          disease progression. In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a
          novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data to identify common patterns of
          gene expression across different conditions. Our analysis reveals that
          diseases are closely linked to specific gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          our use of a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation demonstrates that
          functionally important genes, which may lack individual associations,
          are prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER.
          This work not only fills a gap in current research by highlighting the
          importance of gene co-expression in disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms, but also provides a valuable tool for identifying
          potential therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genetic studies have shown that understanding how genes work together
          in specific contexts is crucial for uncovering disease etiology and
          identifying potential therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have provided valuable insights into the role of
          individual genes in disease mechanisms, the complex nature of
          gene-gene interactions in disease origin and progression remains a
          challenge. In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data to identify common patterns of gene
          expression across different conditions. Our analysis reveals that
          diseases are closely linked to specific gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          our use of a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation demonstrates that
          functionally important genes, which may lack direct associations, are
          prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER. This
          research not only fills a gap in the current literature by
          highlighting the importance of gene co-expression patterns in disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms, but also provides a valuable tool for
          identifying potential therapeutic targets and repurposing existing
          drugs.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their

              traits is crucial for developing new therapies. While

            Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to
            perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
            complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
            regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this
            insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
            same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
            analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of
            co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
            associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene
            strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
            genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This

              significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
              provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

              Genetic studies have shown that genes work together in specific
              contexts to influence complex traits, highlighting the need for a
              mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
              different conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies

              Genetic studies have shown that genes work together in specific
              contexts to influence complex traits, highlighting the need for a
              mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
              different conditions. This insight is crucial for the development
              of new therapies, as individual genes have been implicated in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of complex
              trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
              significant role in disease origin and progression. In this study,
              we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
              associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework
              for contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential
              targets missed by single-gene strategies, offering a promising
              approach for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
              gene modules and advancing the field of functional genomics.

              abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence
              structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should
              follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint

              Genetic studies and functional genomics have provided valuable
              insights into the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms,
              but the contribution of gene-gene interactions in complex traits
              remains a critical gap in our understanding. Here we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait

              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out
              their functions, and understanding how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial
              for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex
              trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
              critical role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We have observed
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, our analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR
              screen reveals that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
              offers a new framework for interpreting genetic associations
              through the lens of gene modules.

              Genetic studies and functional genomics have provided valuable
              insights into the mechanisms underlying complex traits and
              diseases. However, a critical gap in the current literature is the
              lack of a comprehensive approach to integrate gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data for a joint
              analysis. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This approach is based on the concept that genes act in
              concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
              functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex
              traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. Our results demonstrate
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of
              PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a
              novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the
              lens of gene modules and advancing the field of drug repurposing
              and therapeutic target identification.

              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting

              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out
              their functions, and understanding how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial
              for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex
              trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are also
              critical in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We have observed
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, our analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR
              screen reveals that functionally important players lacking
              associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a

              Genetic studies and functional genomics have provided valuable
              insights into the mechanisms underlying complex traits and
              diseases. However, a gap remains in our understanding of how
              gene-gene interactions contribute to disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a

              abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence
              structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should
              follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              single-gene strategies. Our analysis demonstrates that diseases
              are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              our approach prioritizes functionally important players in
              trait-associated modules, as evidenced by our analysis of lipid
              regulation using a CRISPR screen. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
              provides a novel framework for projecting genetic associations
              through gene expression patterns, highlighting disease etiology
              and drug mechanisms, and offering new opportunities for drug
              repurposing and the clustering of complex traits.

              Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              Genetic studies have shown that understanding the interplay
              between genes in specific contexts is crucial for unraveling the
              mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases. However, there
              is a need for a method that can accurately project genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns to highlight disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms. Here we present our novel approach,
              PhenoPLIER, which identifies gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types that are significantly associated with diseases. Our
              results demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, our use of a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation reveals that functionally important players lacking
              associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for
              contextualizing genetic associations and uncovering potential
              therapeutic targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies.
              This approach has broader significance in advancing functional
              genomics and drug repurposing by providing a more comprehensive
              understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              Genetic studies and functional genomics have shown that
              understanding the interplay of genes in specific contexts is
              crucial for unraveling the mechanisms underlying complex traits
              and diseases. However, there is a need for a method that can
              accurately project genetic associations through gene expression
              patterns to highlight disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Here
              we present our novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which identifies gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types that are significantly
              associated with diseases. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER
              is effective in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, our analysis of lipid
              regulation using a CRISPR screen reveals that functionally
              important players lacking associations are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, our findings
              highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic
              associations and uncover potential therapeutic targets that may be
              missed by single-gene strategies, providing a new framework for
              interpreting genetic associations and advancing drug repurposing
              and therapeutic target identification in the field of precision
              medicine.

              abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence

              follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.

              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an

              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader

              Genetic studies have shown that understanding how genes work
              together in specific contexts is crucial for uncovering disease
              etiology and identifying potential therapeutic targets. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable
              insights into the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms,
              modern models of complex traits suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are also important. In this manuscript, we present
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data to identify
              common patterns of gene expression across different conditions.
              Our analysis reveals that diseases are closely linked to specific
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to study

              lack direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated

              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence
              structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should
              follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been
              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that

              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex
              traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial

              Genetic studies have shown that understanding how genes work
              together in specific contexts is crucial for uncovering disease
              etiology and identifying potential therapeutic targets. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable

              modern models of complex traits suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are also key players in disease progression. In this

              that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data to identify common patterns of gene expression
              across different conditions. Our analysis reveals that diseases
              are closely linked to specific gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we
              demonstrate that functionally important genes, which may lack
              direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules

              disease etiology and drug mechanisms, but also provides a valuable

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex
              traits requires a mechanistic understanding of their expression
              regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial
              for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex
              trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are also
              critical in disease origin and progression. In this study, we
              present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions. Our findings show that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Genetic studies have shown that understanding how genes work
              together in specific contexts is crucial for uncovering disease
              etiology and identifying potential therapeutic targets. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable
              insights into the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms,
              modern models of complex traits suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are also key players in disease progression. In this
              manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
              that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data to identify common patterns of gene expression
              across different conditions. Our analysis reveals that diseases
              are closely linked to specific gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, our use of a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation
              demonstrates that functionally important genes, which may lack
              individual associations, are prioritized within trait-associated
              gene modules by PhenoPLIER. This work not only fills a gap in
              current research by highlighting the importance of gene-gene
              interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, but also
              provides a valuable tool for identifying potential therapeutic
              targets and repurposing existing drugs.

              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current

              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an

              Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been
              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex
              traits requires a mechanistic understanding of their expression
              regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial
              for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex
              trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are also
              crucial in disease origin and progression. In this study, we
              present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is

              Genetic studies have shown that understanding how genes work
              together in specific contexts is crucial for uncovering disease
              etiology and identifying potential therapeutic targets. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable
              insights into the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms,
              the complex nature of gene-gene interactions in disease origin and
              progression remains a challenge. In this manuscript, we present
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data to
              identify common patterns of gene expression across different
              conditions. Our analysis reveals that diseases are closely linked
              to specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, our use of a CRISPR
              screen to study lipid regulation demonstrates that functionally
              important genes, which may lack direct associations, are
              prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER.
              This research not only fills a gap in the current literature by
              highlighting the importance of gene co-expression patterns in
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms, but also provides a valuable
              tool for identifying potential therapeutic targets and repurposing
              existing drugs.

              abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence
              structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should
              follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").
