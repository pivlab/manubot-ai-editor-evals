Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are also important in disease origin and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

Genetic studies have shown that genes work together in specific contexts to influence complex traits, highlighting the need for a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial for disease origin and progression. In this manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.

However, a gap remains in our understanding of how gene-gene interactions contribute to disease etiology and drug mechanisms. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. By identifying modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential therapeutic targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. Our analysis demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of gene co-expression in understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms, and PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, with implications for drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.

Genetic studies and functional genomics have shown that understanding the interplay of genes in specific contexts is crucial for unraveling the mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases. However, there is a need for a method that can accurately project genetic associations through gene expression patterns to highlight disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Here we present our novel approach, PhenoPLIER, which identifies gene modules expressed in relevant cell types that are significantly associated with diseases. Our results demonstrate that PhenoPLIER is effective in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, our analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen reveals that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential therapeutic targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies, providing a new framework for interpreting genetic associations and advancing drug repurposing and therapeutic target identification in the field of precision medicine.

Genetic studies have shown that understanding how genes work together in specific contexts is crucial for uncovering disease etiology and identifying potential therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights into the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are also key players in disease progression. In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data to identify common patterns of gene expression across different conditions. Our analysis reveals that diseases are closely linked to specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we demonstrate that functionally important genes, which may lack direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This work not only fills a gap in the current literature by highlighting the importance of gene co-expression in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, but also provides a valuable tool for drug repurposing and identifying therapeutic targets.

Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of their expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are also critical in disease origin and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Genetic studies have shown that understanding how genes work together in specific contexts is crucial for uncovering disease etiology and identifying potential therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights into the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are also key players in disease progression. In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data to identify common patterns of gene expression across different conditions. Our analysis reveals that diseases are closely linked to specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, our use of a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation demonstrates that functionally important genes, which may lack individual associations, are prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER. This work not only fills a gap in current research by highlighting the importance of gene co-expression in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, but also provides a valuable tool for identifying potential therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs.

Our analysis reveals that diseases are closely linked to specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, our use of a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation demonstrates that functionally important genes, which may lack direct associations, are prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER. This research not only fills a gap in the current literature by highlighting the importance of gene co-expression patterns in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, but also provides a valuable tool for identifying potential therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs.
