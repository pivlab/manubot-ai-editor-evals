          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

      response:
        output: ' Genes function intricately together in specific contexts to execute their duties. Understanding how these genes impact complex traits requires a thorough understanding of the regulation of gene expression across various conditions, which is crucial for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped reveal individual genes'' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in the origin and progression of diseases. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules consisting of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions. We observe that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and uncovers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we find functionally important players without direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes allows PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, contributing significantly to disease understanding and drug development.'

          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players

        output: ' The context of this manuscript addresses the need to understand how genes work together in specific settings and their influence on complex traits. Existing transcriptome-wide association studies have limited insight into gene-gene interactions, which are crucial for disease progression according to modern models. To address this issue, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that analyzes gene-trait associations along with pharmacological perturbation data in a latent representation, based on gene modules with similar expression patterns across conditions. We observe that diseases are associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and that our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR to analyze lipid regulation, we found that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players without associations but within trait-associated modules. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes enables PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, offering a novel framework for interpreting genetic connections through gene expression patterns.'

          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across

          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by

Analyzing how these genes influence complex traits requires a comprehensive understanding of gene expression regulation across various conditions, as it plays a vital role in developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped elucidate the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play an essential role in disease etiology and progression. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach is based on modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions, reflecting the contextual nature of genetic influence. Through the use of PhenoPLIER, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we find functionally important players without direct associations but prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, incorporating gene co-expression groups into the analysis offers an approach to contextualize genetic associations and potentially reveals targets missed using single-gene strategies.

        output: ' We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Genes collaborate in various contexts to execute their functions; understanding the complex interplay between these genes is crucial to decipher the etiology of diseases and unravel potential drug mechanisms. Transcriptome-wide association studies have significantly contributed to uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex traits emphasize the significance of gene-gene interactions in shaping the onset and progression of illnesses. PhenoPLIER''s representation is derived from modules comprising genes with similar expression patterns under specific conditions. We have found that diseases are significantly connected to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairings and elucidates the mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we observe that functionally essential players lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes through PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal hidden targets often missed when focusing on individual genes. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for deciphering the intricate genetic connections that underpin disease etiology and drug mechanisms by combining gene expression patterns into gene modules.'

          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their

          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER

        output: ' We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that unifies gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for comprehensive analysis. To understand the intricate influence of genes on complex traits, their coordinated functioning within specific contexts must be elucidated. Determining this requires insight into how expression regulation varies across different conditions, as this knowledge is crucial in devising novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER''s approach is based on modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions, leading us to observe that diseases are linked with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. The method has demonstrated accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs as well as the elucidation of mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we found that functionally significant genes lacking associations were prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into its framework, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and potentially identify overlooked therapeutic targets beyond single-gene strategies. This novel approach offers a means to interpret genetic associations in the context of gene modules and facilitates an understanding of the complex interplay between genetics and disease etiology.'

        output: ' We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. It is well known that genes cooperate with one another in specific contexts to perform their functions, influencing complex traits. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for developing novel therapies. Traditional transcriptome-wide association studies have been effective at revealing the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, but recent models suggest that gene-gene interactions are vital to comprehending the origin and progression of complex diseases. PhenoPLIER''s approach is built on modules of co-expressed genes across common conditions. We observe that diseases associate significantly with these gene expression patterns within relevant cell types. Additionally, our model accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates the mechanisms of action for drugs in relation to traits. Furthermore, a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players which lack individual gene associations but are found in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, by incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene approaches, offering a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.'

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

        output: ' We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions, necessitating an understanding of expression regulation across various conditions for unraveling their influence on complex traits. This insight is crucial for developing new therapeutics. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed individual genes'' role in disease mechanisms; however, modern theories suggest that gene-gene interactions are essential to the origin and progression of complex diseases. PhenoPLIER''s representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions, and our approach successfully predicts known drug-disease associations, while also inferring drug mechanisms. In a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we find that key players lacking direct gene association are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our work highlights the importance of incorporating co-expressed gene groups for better understanding genetic associations and revealing overlooked targets typically missed through single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework to interpret genetic associations in the context of gene expression patterns, thus enhancing our comprehension of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.'

          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

      response:
        output: ' Genes collaborate in specific scenarios to execute their functions, necessitating a deeper understanding of how they influence complex traits. Developing effective therapies hinges on unveiling the intricacies of gene expression regulation across varying contexts. Our recent findings demonstrate that diseases have significant associations with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease associations as well as elucidates their mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to explore lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players that lack direct connections but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER due to co-expression. In summary, integrating groups of co-expressed genes through PhenoPLIER enables the contextualization of genetic associations and highlights targets missed using single-gene approaches. The novel framework offered by PhenoPLIER redefines how we interpret genetic associations within the broader context of gene modules.'

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

        output: ' Genes work together within specific contexts to carry out their functions, necessitating the understanding of how they regulate expression across different conditions. This knowledge is vital for uncovering treatments as it can influence complex traits. Our research in this study shows that diseases are strongly linked with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, our approach is accurate at predicting drug-disease associations and elucidating their mechanisms of action. When using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that certain players without clear connections to the disease were actually prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules. In summary, PhenoPLIER employs co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and identify potential targets missed through single-gene strategies. This novel framework paves the way for interpreting genetic connections through the lens of gene modules, thereby advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.'

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

           Genes collaborate to carry out their functions, often working together in specific contexts. To understand how these genes influence complex traits and the development of novel therapies requires an appreciation for the mechanisms behind gene expression regulation across various conditions. It has been demonstrated that this comprehension is crucial when attempting to develop new treatments. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role individual genes play in disease-related processes. However, current models predicting the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are paramount in understanding the origins and progression of diseases.

          In order to tackle this issue, we introduce PhenoPLIER - a
          computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a single latent representation
          for further analysis. This representation is based on modules
          comprising groups of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns
          across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
          PhenoPLIER demonstrates accurate predictions regarding known
          drug-disease relationships, as well as the mechanisms of action
          involved.


          Additionally, by employing CRISPR screening to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally significant players are not
          associated with specific traits, but are prioritized within
          trait-associated gene modules when analyzed using PhenoPLIER. This
          further highlights the potential value of this computational approach
          in advancing our understanding of complex genetic associations and
          their implications on disease etiology, drug mechanisms, and
          therapeutic targets.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

        output: ' Genes cooperate to perform their functions, and understanding gene expression patterns in various contexts is crucial for unraveling the intricacies of complex traits. However, determining how these genes contribute to disease requires exploring gene-gene interactions as well. Existing transcriptome-wide association studies provide insight into individual genes'' roles in disease mechanisms, yet do not fully address the impact of gene-gene interactions on disease etiology and drug development. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations, pharmacological perturbation data, and expression patterns to identify gene modules associated with diseases in specific cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, uncovers mechanisms of action, and prioritizes functionally important players lacking direct associations but linked to trait-associated gene modules. By filling this gap, PhenoPLIER has broader implications for our understanding of disease etiology and the development of more effective therapies.'

        output: ' Genes collaborate with each other to execute their functions in specific contexts, influencing the development of complex traits. Understanding the influence of these genes on disease-related processes necessitates an investigation into expression regulation across varying conditions and scenarios. This knowledge is crucial for creating novel therapies. Existing transcriptome-wide association studies have helped unveil the roles of individual genes in relation to their disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in the origin and progression of diseases. To address this issue, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for a comprehensive analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across comparable conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly connected to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER exhibits remarkable accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating their mechanisms of action. Through a CRISPR screen analysis on lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting the tool''s capacity to identify key players in complex trait development and drug repurposing applications.'

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

        output: ' Genes collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions, influencing complex traits through expression regulation. Gaining insight into this mechanism is essential for developing effective therapies, particularly in understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide association studies have enabled the identification of genes with links to disease-related processes, it is evident that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease initiation and progression. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER - a computational method that connects gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data by representing them within a common latent representation. This approach utilizes modules consisting of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions. We observe that diseases are substantially associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, allowing PhenoPLIER to accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and elucidate their mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we discover that functional players without direct trait associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This novel approach aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of genetic interactions, ultimately benefiting therapeutic development and drug repurposing efforts in complex diseases.'

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

        output: ' Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates examining expression regulation across different conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing new therapies, yet transcriptome-wide association studies primarily focus on individual gene roles. Modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across conditions. We found that diseases are associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action, also prioritizing functionally important players not associated with traits but present in trait-associated modules through a CRISPR screen targeting lipid regulation.'

Traditional transcriptome-wide association studies have proven valuable in revealing the roles of individual genes; however, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease genesis and progression. To address this issue, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that converts gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across multiple conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found functionally important players without direct trait associations to be prioritized within the trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER.'

          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped reveal individual genes'' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in the origin and progression of diseases. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

We observe that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and uncovers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we find functionally important players without direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes allows PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, contributing significantly to disease understanding and drug development.'

            text: ' Genes function together in specific contexts to perform their tasks, and understanding how they influence complex traits requires an understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is critical for developing new therapies targeting diseases. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease etiology. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This method uses modules of genes with similar expression patterns across conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate at predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we observe that important players lack direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, integrating groups of co-expressed genes into PhenoPLIER helps contextualize genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Overall, this novel framework offers a valuable approach for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, contributing to our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.'

               Genes work harmoniously with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions, and understanding how these interactions influence complex traits requires an in-depth analysis of gene regulation under various conditions. This insight is vital for developing effective therapeutics. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in revealing the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in both disease origins and progression. To address this issue, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, highlighting their significance in disease-relevant cell types. We observe that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. By incorporating gene co-expression, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and identifies overlooked potential targets, surpassing the limitations of single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations by examining them through the lens of gene expression modules, advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

            text: ' Genes collaborate to perform their functions, requiring a thorough understanding of gene expression regulation across various contexts. Unraveling how these genes contribute to complex traits is crucial for the development of new treatments. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover individual genes'' roles in disease mechanisms; however, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in disease etiology and progression. Introducing PhenoPLIER, we developed a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis based on modules of genes expressing similarly across conditions. We observed that diseases are significantly linked to expression patterns in relevant cell types and accurately predicted known drug-disease pairs as well as mechanisms of action. Using CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players lacking direct associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by integrating gene co-expression patterns, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework to contextualize genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, thus advancing the understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.'

Additionally, we demonstrate this approach''s efficacy through a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation by identifying functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER''s integration of groups of co-expressed genes helps contextualize genetic associations, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and establishing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.'

               We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Genes collaborate in various contexts to execute their functions; understanding the complex interplay between these genes is crucial to decipher the etiology of diseases and unravel potential drug mechanisms. Transcriptome-wide association studies have significantly contributed to uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex traits emphasize the significance of gene-gene interactions in shaping the onset and progression of illnesses. PhenoPLIER's representation is derived from modules comprising genes with similar expression patterns under specific conditions. We have found that diseases are significantly connected to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairings and elucidates the mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we observe that functionally essential players lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes through PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal hidden targets often missed when focusing on individual genes. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for deciphering the intricate genetic connections that underpin disease etiology and drug mechanisms by combining gene expression patterns into gene modules.

               This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that connects gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data to provide a common latent representation for integrated analysis. To understand how genes impact complex traits, it's crucial to recognize their collective expression regulation across different conditions. Traditional transcriptome studies have revealed individual gene roles in disease mechanisms; however, modern models suggest gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease development and progression. PhenoPLIER's approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns under the same conditions. We observed that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and the method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Moreover, utilizing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation analysis, we discovered functionally important players without direct associations but prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. In conclusion, by incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers missed potential targets through single-gene strategies. This study provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene expression patterns and modules.

               The gap in the understanding of complex trait etiology and drug mechanisms led to developing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that links gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data. It is essential to explore the coordination among genes in specific contexts for their function. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires comprehending expression regulation across various conditions, which is critical for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have provided insights into individual gene roles in disease mechanisms; however, modern models of complex trait architecture highlight the importance of gene-gene interactions. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes under similar conditions. We observed significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and demonstrated accurate predictions for known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players without direct associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into PhenoPLIER enables contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. It presents a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

               We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that unifies gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for comprehensive analysis. To understand the intricate influence of genes on complex traits, their coordinated functioning within specific contexts must be elucidated. Determining this requires insight into how expression regulation varies across different conditions, as this knowledge is crucial in devising novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER's approach is based on modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions, leading us to observe that diseases are linked with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. The method has demonstrated accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs as well as the elucidation of mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we found that functionally significant genes lacking associations were prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into its framework, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and potentially identify overlooked therapeutic targets beyond single-gene strategies. This novel approach offers a means to interpret genetic associations in the context of gene modules and facilitates an understanding of the complex interplay between genetics and disease etiology.

               In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data to analyze genetic influences on complex traits. Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions, influencing disease mechanisms and drug development. While transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed individual genes' roles in these processes, it is crucial to account for the effects of gene-gene interactions in complex trait formation. PhenoPLIER's methodology uses gene modules with similar expression patterns across various conditions, allowing it to identify relevant diseases and predict drug-disease associations. Our findings suggest that essential players may lack direct genetic links but are prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated gene modules due to their co-expression patterns. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a new framework for examining genetic influences through the lens of gene expression modules and can contextualize associations to reveal overlooked therapeutic targets in complex traits.

               We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. It is well known that genes cooperate with one another in specific contexts to perform their functions, influencing complex traits. A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for developing novel therapies. Traditional transcriptome-wide association studies have been effective at revealing the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, but recent models suggest that gene-gene interactions are vital to comprehending the origin and progression of complex diseases. PhenoPLIER's approach is built on modules of co-expressed genes across common conditions. We observe that diseases associate significantly with these gene expression patterns within relevant cell types. Additionally, our model accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates the mechanisms of action for drugs in relation to traits. Furthermore, a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation revealed that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players which lack individual gene associations but are found in trait-associated modules.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic

              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting

               We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions, necessitating an understanding of expression regulation across various conditions for unraveling their influence on complex traits. This insight is crucial for developing new therapeutics. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed individual genes' role in disease mechanisms; however, modern theories suggest that gene-gene interactions are essential to the origin and progression of complex diseases. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions, and our approach successfully predicts known drug-disease associations, while also inferring drug mechanisms. In a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we find that key players lacking direct gene association are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our work highlights the importance of incorporating co-expressed gene groups for better understanding genetic associations and revealing overlooked targets typically missed through single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework to interpret genetic associations in the context of gene expression patterns, thus enhancing our comprehension of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               Genes collaborate in specific scenarios to execute their functions, necessitating a deeper understanding of how they influence complex traits. Developing effective therapies hinges on unveiling the intricacies of gene expression regulation across varying contexts. Our recent findings demonstrate that diseases have significant associations with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease associations as well as elucidates their mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to explore lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players that lack direct connections but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER due to co-expression. In summary, integrating groups of co-expressed genes through PhenoPLIER enables the contextualization of genetic associations and highlights targets missed using single-gene approaches. The novel framework offered by PhenoPLIER redefines how we interpret genetic associations within the broader context of gene modules.

               Genes work together within specific contexts to carry out their functions, necessitating the understanding of how they regulate expression across different conditions. This knowledge is vital for uncovering treatments as it can influence complex traits. Our research in this study shows that diseases are strongly linked with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, our approach is accurate at predicting drug-disease associations and elucidating their mechanisms of action. When using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that certain players without clear connections to the disease were actually prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules. In summary, PhenoPLIER employs co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and identify potential targets missed through single-gene strategies. This novel framework paves the way for interpreting genetic connections through the lens of gene modules, thereby advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               Genes collaborate to execute their functions in particular settings, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates insight into expression regulation across various conditions. This comprehension is crucial for developing novel therapeutics. Our study reveals that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. By employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally essential players lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, integrating co-expressed gene clusters, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic relationships and identify missed potential targets previously overlooked by single-gene approaches. This novel framework offered by PhenoPLIER allows for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thus providing a new perspective on disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               Genes collaborate to execute their functions under specific contexts, necessitating an understanding of how they regulate expression across varying conditions for deciphering complex traits' influence. This knowledge is crucial for devising new therapies. Our study demonstrates that diseases are closely associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Predictably, our approach accurately identifies known drug-disease relationships and elucidates mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find functionally significant players with no associations but are prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated gene modules. In conclusion, integrating groups of co-expressed genes into PhenoPLIER enables contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers overlooked targets compared to single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic links through gene module analysis.

               Genes function in collaboration to carry out their roles, and their interactions are crucial for understanding the intricacies of complex traits. Determining how these genes influence various characteristics necessitates a deeper understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. This insight plays a vital role in developing new therapies. In this study, we demonstrate that diseases possess significant associations with gene modules expressed specifically in relevant cell types and that our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Through a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we observe that while functionally crucial genes may lack direct associations, they are prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating co-expressed gene groups via PhenoPLIER provides an innovative framework for contextualizing genetic associations and uncovers potential targets missed through single-gene approaches, thereby broadening the scope of disease etiology research and drug mechanisms exploration.

               Genes interact in specific contexts to perform their functions, and determining how they influence complex traits is crucial for understanding gene expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is vital for developing new therapies, as it can improve our knowledge of disease mechanisms and drug repurposing. We demonstrate in this study that diseases are associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and by predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring their mechanisms, our approach highlights the importance of using co-expressed genes for better interpretation of genetic associations. PhenoPLIER's method reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and provides a novel framework for understanding complex traits through gene module analysis.

               Genes collaborate to execute their functions in specific contexts, and elucidating how they influence complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapeutic interventions. Our study demonstrates that diseases are substantially linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, with our approach accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and revealing the mechanisms of action. Utilizing CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally vital genes lack associations but get prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER aids in contextualizing genetic associations and unveiling potential targets missed by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER introduces a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations via the perspective of gene modules.

               Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions, influencing complex traits. To comprehend the mechanisms of expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for understanding disease etiology and developing effective therapies. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, enabling accurate predictions of drug-disease pairs and identifying mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we found that functionally important genes lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER bridges genetic associations with gene co-expression groups, providing a new framework for interpreting these connections and revealing potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This novel approach sheds light on the significance of integrating gene expression patterns in genetic association studies, ultimately advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               Genes collaborate to carry out their functions, often working together in specific contexts. To understand how these genes influence complex traits and the development of novel therapies requires an appreciation for the mechanisms behind gene expression regulation across various conditions. It has been demonstrated that this comprehension is crucial when attempting to develop new treatments. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role individual genes play in disease-related processes. However, current models predicting the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are paramount in understanding the origins and progression of diseases.

              In order to tackle this issue, we introduce PhenoPLIER - a
              computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a single latent
              representation for further analysis. This representation is based
              on modules comprising groups of genes that exhibit similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates accurate
              predictions regarding known drug-disease relationships, as well as
              the mechanisms of action involved.


              Additionally, by employing CRISPR screening to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally significant players are not
              associated with specific traits, but are prioritized within

               Genes cooperate to perform their functions, and understanding gene expression patterns in various contexts is crucial for unraveling the intricacies of complex traits. However, determining how these genes contribute to disease requires exploring gene-gene interactions as well. Existing transcriptome-wide association studies provide insight into individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms, yet do not fully address the impact of gene-gene interactions on disease etiology and drug development. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations, pharmacological perturbation data, and expression patterns to identify gene modules associated with diseases in specific cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, uncovers mechanisms of action, and prioritizes functionally important players lacking direct associations but linked to trait-associated gene modules. By filling this gap, PhenoPLIER has broader implications for our understanding of disease etiology and the development of more effective therapies.

              Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been
              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.

               Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions. Understanding how they impact complex traits demands insight into expression regulation across various conditions. This is vital for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms, but modern models suggest gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease development and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on gene modules with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe diseases are significantly associated with these trait-associated gene modules in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we see that functionally important players lacking direct associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

               Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts, and comprehending how they influence complex traits necessitates understanding the regulation of gene expression across different scenarios. This insight is vital for the development of new treatments, with transcriptome-wide association studies having already revealed the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in the origin and progression of complex traits. Introducing PhenoPLIER, we have developed a computational method that maps genetic associations to pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

               Genes collaborate to execute their functions within specific contexts, necessitating an understanding of how these genes influence complex traits in various conditions. Gaining insight into expression regulation is crucial for developing effective therapies and unraveling disease-related mechanisms. Traditional transcriptome-wide association studies have proven valuable in revealing the roles of individual genes; however, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease genesis and progression. To address this issue, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that converts gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across multiple conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found functionally important players without direct trait associations to be prioritized within the trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure

              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
