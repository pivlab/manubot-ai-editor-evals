          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
          their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          The revised abstract is clearer and more concise than the original
          version. It effectively summarizes the key findings and methods used
          in the study, while also providing an overview of the potential
          implications of their work.

          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
          their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of

          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps

          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

            improving the text of a manuscript with title '{{ title }}' and
            keywords '{{ keywords }}.' Revise the following abstract of this
            manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a
            context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single
            paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to
            follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
            follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to
            the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients
            the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
            research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands
            on the open question that the research answered. A successful
            context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s
            contributions from the current state of the art by communicating
            what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
            that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the
            broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here
            we") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to
            fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive
            summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the
            results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the
            context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion
            section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field
            forward (i.e., "broader significance").

              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.
              PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules.

            Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to
            perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
            complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
            regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this
            insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
            same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
            analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated

              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different
              conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for
              developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have helped uncover the role of individual genes in

              play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we

              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
              representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
              significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER

              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in
              concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
              functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
              requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight
              is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of
              the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight
              is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of
              the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the

              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights

              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results
              in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting

              etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results
              in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid

              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the

              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits

              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in

              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,

            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
            to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with

              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the

              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.

              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence

              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").
