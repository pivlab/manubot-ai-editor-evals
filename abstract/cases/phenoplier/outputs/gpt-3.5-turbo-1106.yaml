          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions. This insight is crucial for developing new therapies, as
          transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. In
          this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. Our findings show that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR

          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can

          by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions. This insight is crucial for developing new therapies, as
          transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. In
          this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. Our findings show that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can

          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.

          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a

          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
          their functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex
          traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions. This insight is critical for developing
          new therapies, as transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
          uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.
          However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict
          that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our analysis
          reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and
          advancing the field of functional genomics and drug repurposing.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. Our findings show that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, there is a
          need for a computational approach that can map gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for a joint analysis. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          novel method that addresses this gap by identifying gene modules with
          similar expression patterns across different conditions. This approach
          allows for a mechanistic understanding of gene influence on complex
          traits, which is crucial for developing new therapies. Our analysis
          shows that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, our approach prioritizes functionally important players
          in trait-associated modules, which are missed by single-gene
          strategies. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          highlighting disease etiology and potential therapeutic targets, and
          advancing the field of drug repurposing and clustering of complex
          traits.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for joint analysis. Genes collaborate in
          specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how
          these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.
          This insight is crucial for the development of new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of
          complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are
          pivotal in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We have observed that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our

          using a CRISPR screen reveals that functionally important players
          lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed

          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for joint analysis. Genes collaborate in
          specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how
          these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions.
          This insight is crucial for the development of new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of
          complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are
          pivotal in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We have observed that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, our analysis of lipid regulation
          using a CRISPR screen reveals that functionally important players
          lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules.

          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, there is a
          need for a computational approach that can map gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for a joint analysis. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          novel method that addresses this gap by identifying gene modules with
          similar expression patterns across different conditions. This approach
          allows for a mechanistic understanding of gene influence on complex
          traits, which is crucial for developing new therapies. Our analysis
          shows that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, our approach prioritizes functionally important players
          in trait-associated modules, which are missed by single-gene
          strategies. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
          highlighting disease etiology and potential therapeutic targets, and
          advancing the field of drug repurposing and clustering of complex
          traits.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a

          specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how
          these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic

          This insight is crucial for the development of new therapies. While

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for
          interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          detailed understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions. This insight is crucial for the development of new
          therapies. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly
          linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, our analysis of lipid regulation
          using a CRISPR screen reveals that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover
          potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies.
          This framework provides a novel approach for interpreting genetic
          associations through the perspective of gene modules.

          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader

          Genetic studies have shown that understanding the gene expression
          patterns and their influence on complex traits is crucial for
          developing new therapies. Here we present a novel method, PhenoPLIER,
          which accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action by analyzing gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly
          associated with these gene modules, highlighting the importance of
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes in interpreting genetic
          associations. Additionally, our approach prioritizes functionally
          important players in trait-associated modules, providing a new
          framework for revealing potential therapeutic targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. This study fills the gap in the literature by
          showing how PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
          provide insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms, thus
          advancing the field of functional genomics and drug repurposing.

          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          Genetic studies have shown that understanding the gene expression
          patterns and their influence on complex traits is crucial for
          developing new therapies. Here we present a novel method, PhenoPLIER,
          which accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action by analyzing gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly
          associated with these gene modules, highlighting the importance of
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes in interpreting genetic
          associations. Additionally, our approach prioritizes functionally
          important players in trait-associated modules, providing a new
          framework for revealing potential therapeutic targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. This study fills the gap in the literature by
          showing how PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
          provide insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms, thus
          advancing the field of functional genomics and drug repurposing.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and

          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

          Genetic studies have shown that understanding the gene expression
          patterns and their influence on complex traits is crucial for
          developing new therapies. Here we present a novel method, PhenoPLIER,
          which accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action by analyzing gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly

          important players in trait-associated modules, providing a new
          framework for revealing potential therapeutic targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. This study fills the gap in the literature by
          showing how PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
          provide insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms, thus
          advancing the field of functional genomics and drug repurposing.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          detailed understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions. This insight is crucial for the development of new
          therapies. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly
          linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our

          potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies.
          This framework provides a novel approach for interpreting genetic

          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          detailed understanding of how their expression is regulated across
          different conditions. This insight is crucial for the development of
          new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are also important in disease origin and

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          detailed understanding of how their expression is regulated across
          different conditions. This insight is crucial for the development of
          new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are also important in disease origin and
          progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings
          show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
          different conditions. This insight is crucial for the development of
          new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings
          show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This approach
          fills the gap in understanding gene-gene interactions in disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms, providing a valuable tool for
          identifying therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
          different conditions. This insight is crucial for the development of
          new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings
          show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This approach
          fills the gap in understanding gene-gene interactions in disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms, providing a valuable tool for
          identifying therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and

          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
          different conditions. This insight is crucial for the development of
          new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings
          show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This approach
          fills the gap in understanding gene-gene interactions in disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms, providing a valuable tool for
          identifying therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.

            Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to
            perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
            complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
            regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this
            insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
            same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
            analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of

              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies

              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
              representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
              significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,

              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions, and understanding how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is
              critical for developing new therapies, as transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of

              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection

              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights

              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. Genes collaborate in specific contexts to carry out
              their functions, and understanding how these genes influence

              regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial
              for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide

              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. Genes collaborate in specific contexts to carry out
              their functions, and understanding how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial
              for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex
              trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal
              in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions. We have observed that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              our analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen reveals
              that functionally important players lacking associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a
              novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the
              lens of gene modules.

              In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, there is
              a need for a computational approach that can map gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for a joint analysis. Here we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel method that addresses this gap by identifying
              gene modules with similar expression patterns across different
              conditions. This approach allows for a mechanistic understanding
              of gene influence on complex traits, which is crucial for
              developing new therapies. Our analysis shows that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, our approach
              prioritizes functionally important players in trait-associated
              modules, which are missed by single-gene strategies. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules,
              highlighting disease etiology and potential therapeutic targets,
              and advancing the field of drug repurposing and clustering of

              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights

              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic

              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting

            concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
            functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
            requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
            different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's
            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
            patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
            significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
            cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known

              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. Genes collaborate in specific contexts to carry out
              their functions, and understanding how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial
              for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex
              trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal
              in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is

              our analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen reveals
              that functionally important players lacking associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a

              In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, there is
              a need for a computational approach that can map gene-trait

              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex
              traits requires a detailed understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions. This insight is crucial for the

              are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant

              associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been

              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex
              traits requires a detailed understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions. This insight is crucial for the
              development of new therapies. Our study demonstrates that diseases
              are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              our analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen reveals
              that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
              PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, can
              contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets
              that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. This framework

              Genetic studies have shown that understanding the gene expression
              patterns and their influence on complex traits is crucial for
              developing new therapies. Here we present a novel method,
              PhenoPLIER, which accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action by analyzing gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly associated with these gene modules, highlighting the
              importance of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes in
              interpreting genetic associations. Additionally, our approach
              prioritizes functionally important players in trait-associated
              modules, providing a new framework for revealing potential
              therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. This study

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex
              traits requires a detailed understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions. This insight is crucial for the
              development of new therapies. Our study demonstrates that diseases
              are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              our analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen reveals
              that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary,
              PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, can
              contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets
              that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. This framework

              Genetic studies have shown that understanding the gene expression
              patterns and their influence on complex traits is crucial for
              developing new therapies. Here we present a novel method,
              PhenoPLIER, which accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action by analyzing gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly associated with these gene modules, highlighting the
              importance of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes in
              interpreting genetic associations. Additionally, our approach
              prioritizes functionally important players in trait-associated
              modules, providing a new framework for revealing potential
              therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. This study
              fills the gap in the literature by showing how PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and provide insights into
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms, thus advancing the field of
              functional genomics and drug repurposing.

              associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been
              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex
              traits requires a mechanistic understanding of gene expression
              regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial
              for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex
              trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
              crucial role in disease origin and progression. In this study, we
              present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the

              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first

              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,

            traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
            across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
            the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
            to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex
              traits requires a detailed understanding of how their expression
              is regulated across different conditions. This insight is crucial
              for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex

              important in disease origin and progression. In this study, we

              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.
