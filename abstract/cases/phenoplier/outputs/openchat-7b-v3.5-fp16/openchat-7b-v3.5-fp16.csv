The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\""Here we\"") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \""broader significance\"").\n\nInput paragraph: {{ paragraph }}\n\nRevised paragraph:"",""display"":""/home/miltondp/projects/others/manubot/manubot-ai-editor-evals/abstract/prompts/candidate.txt"",""id"":""1dd365a9bb4d181580c711f92234a3eb9f11ee68b4877763e27cf57607fb0222"",""metrics"":{""score"":19.375,""testPassCount"":15,""testFailCount"":5,""assertPassCount"":155,""assertFailCount"":5,""totalLatencyMs"":82332,""tokenUsage"":{""total"":0,""prompt"":0,""completion"":0,""cached"":0},""namedScores"":{}}}",keywords,paragraph,test_description,title

 Genes work together in specific contexts to fulfill their functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic grasp of expression regulation across different conditions. Such insight is crucial for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.

We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
