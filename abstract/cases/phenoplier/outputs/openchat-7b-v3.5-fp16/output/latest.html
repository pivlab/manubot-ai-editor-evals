To understand how these genes affect complex traits, it is necessary to gain insight into expression regulation across different conditions which has been shown to be essential for developing new therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease initiation and progression. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Using this approach, we show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes allows PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework provides a method for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.">[PASS] (1.00)  The coordinated action of multiple genes is crucial to their function in specific contexts.

 We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Genes function cooperatively in specific contexts to execute their tasks. Understanding how these genes affect complex traits necessitates an insight into the regulation of expression across various conditions. This comprehension is crucial for developing innovative therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped elucidate the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.

 The identification of genetic associations with disease has been instrumental in elucidating disease etiology, yet it has failed to fully capture the complex mechanisms underlying these associations. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action by leveraging co-expression networks to contextualize genetic associations. Furthermore, we show that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players in trait-associated modules, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms that can inform the development of more effective therapeutics.">[FAIL] (0.88) Expected output to contain "CRISPR"

 Genes interact with each other to carry out their functions in specific contexts. Understanding the influence of these genes on complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is vital for the development of new treatments. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in uncovering individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial to understanding disease origin and progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on groups of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our observations show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action.

 Complex traits are influenced by multiple genes working together under specific conditions, and understanding the regulatory mechanisms of these genes is vital for developing new therapies.

This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.</td>
