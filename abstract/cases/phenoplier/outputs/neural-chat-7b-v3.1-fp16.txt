          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

        output: ' Genes collaborate intricately in specific contexts to carry out their functions, necessitating an understanding of their influence on complex traits. Determining gene-associated disease etiology and drug mechanisms requires a deep comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in disease-relevant processes; however, modern architectural models predict that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of complex traits. Introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations, pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation, allows for joint analysis. This representation is built upon modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results showcase that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER exhibits high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. By leveraging a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we uncover the presence of functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, through incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and highlights potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.'

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and uncovers their mechanisms of action. Utilizing a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of co-expressed genes and thus contextualizes genetic associations, potentially revealing overlooked targets missed by single-gene approaches. As a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, PhenoPLIER offers a new way to decipher disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies.'

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

        output: ' Genes collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions, and comprehension of how they influence complex traits is essential for understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Identifying the gene-gene interactions involved in the development of diseases is crucial for creating new therapeutics. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been effective in uncovering the roles of individual genes in relevant mechanisms, yet contemporary models suggest that the architecture of complex traits relies heavily on genetic interplay. To address this challenge, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on gene modules with similar expression patterns across various conditions. By analyzing these modules, we discover that diseases are significantly associated with relevant cell types'' expressed genes, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players without explicit genetic associations were prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, through integrating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for contextualizing genetic associations and potentially identifying missed targets from single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER provides a novel perspective on interpreting genetic associations in the context of gene expression patterns, ultimately highlighting the significance of these associations for disease etiology and drug mechanisms.'

Determining this has crucial implications for developing new therapies, especially in the light of modern models predicting that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, but a comprehensive understanding requires considering multiple interacting genes simultaneously. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. It utilizes modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions as its basis and successfully associates diseases with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs, inferring mechanisms of action, and prioritizing functionally important players that lack direct associations but are part of trait-associated modules. This suggests the potential for missing targets when relying solely on single-gene strategies. Thus, PhenoPLIER''s novel framework provides a means to contextualize genetic associations through gene module analysis and could enhance therapeutic interventions.'

        output: ' Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits requires examining gene expression regulation across different conditions. This knowledge is vital for developing effective therapies. However, while transcriptome-wide association studies have helped reveal individual genes'' roles in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in the origin and progression of diseases. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach using modules of co-expressed genes as its foundation to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data for joint analysis. We observed that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and identifies mechanisms of action, even for genes lacking direct genetic associations but significant in the context of trait-associated modules. By incorporating gene expression patterns, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework to contextualize genetic associations and explore potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies, thus advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms through a holistic approach that accounts for the complex interplay between genes and their interactions.'

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

By offering this novel framework, PhenoPLIER provides a fresh perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, ultimately enhancing our understanding of disease etiology, therapeutic targets, and drug mechanisms.'

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

        output: ' This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Gaining insight into how genes work together in specific contexts is crucial for understanding their impact on complex traits and developing effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies help reveal individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in disease etiology. PhenoPLIER''s approach represents genes as groups with similar expression patterns across conditions and identifies diseases associated with relevant cell types. We demonstrate accurate predictions of drug-disease pairs and the ability to infer mechanisms of action using PhenoPLIER. Furthermore, a CRISPR screen showed that functionally important players not linked through single-gene associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER''s novel framework allows for contextualizing genetic associations using gene co-expression groups, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and contributing to a broader understanding of disease mechanisms.'

        output: ' We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates investigating the regulation of gene expression across various conditions. This insight has proven crucial for developing new therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in identifying individual genes'' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER''s representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, and we observe diseases being significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We showcase PhenoPLIER''s ability to accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and elucidate mechanisms of action, as well as identifying functionally important players previously missed by single-gene strategies within trait-associated gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader

          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their

          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical

          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

        output: ' We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach, which aims to bridge the gap between genetic studies and pharmacological perturbation data. This innovative method enables a joint analysis by mapping gene-trait associations into a shared latent representation. It is essential to understand how genes collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions, and determining the impact of these interactions on complex traits requires a deep comprehension of the regulation of gene expression across diverse conditions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in revealing individual genes'' role in disease mechanisms; however, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in the development and progression of diseases. PhenoPLIER is based on modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns under identical conditions, as opposed to solely focusing on single-genes. We have observed significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and identifies the mechanisms of action. By analyzing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we uncover essential players that are functionally important but lack direct genetic association connections, yet can be prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, this framework incorporating groups of co-expressed genes allows for contextualizing genetic associations, thus revealing potential targets that may not have been captured through single-gene strategies. By using PhenoPLIER, we introduce a novel method to interpret and leverage genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and their complex interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.'

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring

        output: ' Introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis, we focus on the importance of understanding how genes collaborate to influence complex traits. This insight is critical in unraveling disease etiology and developing novel therapeutics. Traditional transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify individual gene roles in relevant disease mechanisms; however, they often overlook the crucial role of gene-gene interactions in shaping complex traits'' architecture. PhenoPLIER represents genetic data using modules of genes with similar expression patterns across specific conditions and conditions relevant to a particular disease. We find that our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease associations, understanding mechanisms of action, and highlighting functionally important players in lipid regulation that lack direct trait associations but are prioritized within the trait-associated modules. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework to contextualize genetic associations through co-expressed gene modules, thus revealing overlooked targets and enabling more effective target discovery strategies beyond single-gene approaches.'

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze

        output: ' We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that unites gene-trait associations and pharmacological data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach enables a deeper understanding of gene function in the context of specific conditions related to complex traits. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms; however, modern models emphasize the significance of gene-gene interactions in the origin and progression of diseases. By modeling genes as modules based on similar expression patterns across conditions, PhenoPLIER associates diseases with gene sets expressed in relevant cell types accurately predicts drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Our work suggests that PhenoPLIER can identify potentially missed targets by prioritizing co-expressed genes over single-gene strategies. Overall, this novel framework facilitates interpretation of genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, aiding in revealing hidden therapeutic targets.'

        output: ' Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts, and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates a deeper comprehension of expression regulation across varying conditions. This insight is crucial for the development of novel therapies. In this study, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring their mechanisms of action. Utilizing CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, it was discovered that functionally important players may lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This highlights the importance of grouping co-expressed genes to provide context for genetic associations, and consequently identify potential targets missed through single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER presents a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations in a manner that considers gene expression patterns within groups (modules).'

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

By employing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we found that functional players with no direct association are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

        output: ' Genes work together in specific contexts to execute their functions, and understanding the influence they exert on complex traits requires a thorough comprehension of how these genes regulate expression under various conditions. This knowledge is vital for developing new therapeutic strategies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed individual gene roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, contemporary models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in the origin and progression of diseases. To address this issue, we introduce PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This approach is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across various conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships as well as the mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis into lipid regulation reveals functionally important players without direct associations; however, these genes are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, our study emphasizes the importance of integrating genetic studies and functional genomics for a comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.'

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

        output: ' Genes often collaborate with one another in specific contexts to execute their functions, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of how these genes contribute to complex traits. The elucidation of this relationship is crucial for devising new therapies and targeting disease mechanisms. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in disease-relevant processes. Modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in the development and progression of complex traits. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that merges gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation utilizes modules consisting of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly connected to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER is adept at predicting known drug-disease associations as well as uncovering their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen studying lipid regulation, we find that functionally critical players may lack direct associations but can be prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER due to shared expression patterns across relevant conditions.'

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

        output: ' Genes collaboratively contribute to intricate functional processes, necessitating a deeper comprehension of how they impact complex traits. Understanding the expression regulation of genes in varying contexts is imperative for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms, modern architectural models emphasize the significance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression. To address this complexity, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that incorporates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space representation for integrated analysis. This approach utilizes modules based on genes sharing expression patterns across conditions, which enables us to identify disease associations with relevant cell types and accurately predict known drug-disease pairs. Additionally, our method can infer mechanisms of action. Using CRISPR screens in lipid regulation research, we observe that essential players are not necessarily associated directly but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting its utility in revealing functional relationships and guiding therapeutic development.'

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

        output: ' Genes collaborate to execute their functions within specific contexts, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for developing effective therapies and elucidating the mechanisms underlying disease etiology. While transcriptome-wide association studies have provided insights into individual genes'' roles in disease-related processes, it has become evident that gene-gene interactions play a vital part in disease development and progression according to modern models of complex trait architecture. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER - a computational approach that unites genetic associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This framework is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across multiple conditions. Our findings show that diseases have significant correlations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and deciphers their mechanisms of action. Through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we discover that genes without direct associations but are crucial players are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.'

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

            manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a
            context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single
            paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to
            follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
            follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to
            the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients
            the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
            research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands
            on the open question that the research answered. A successful
            context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s
            contributions from the current state of the art by communicating
            what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
            that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the
            broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here
            we") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to
            fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive
            summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the
            results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the
            context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion
            section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field
            forward (i.e., "broader significance").

            text: ' Genes collaborate intricately in specific contexts to carry out their functions, necessitating an understanding of their influence on complex traits. Determining gene-associated disease etiology and drug mechanisms requires a deep comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in disease-relevant processes; however, modern architectural models predict that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of complex traits. Introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations, pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation, allows for joint analysis. This representation is built upon modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results showcase that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER exhibits high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. By leveraging a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we uncover the presence of functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, through incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and highlights potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.'

               Genes function in concert with one another in specific contexts to perform their functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires knowledge of expression regulation across different conditions. Determining this has crucial implications for developing new therapies, especially in the light of modern models predicting that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, but a comprehensive understanding requires considering multiple interacting genes simultaneously. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. It utilizes modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions as its basis and successfully associates diseases with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs, inferring mechanisms of action, and prioritizing functionally important players that lack direct associations but are part of trait-associated modules. This suggests the potential for missing targets when relying solely on single-gene strategies. Thus, PhenoPLIER's novel framework provides a means to contextualize genetic associations through gene module analysis and could enhance therapeutic interventions.

               Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits requires examining gene expression regulation across different conditions. This knowledge is vital for developing effective therapies. However, while transcriptome-wide association studies have helped reveal individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in the origin and progression of diseases. To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach using modules of co-expressed genes as its foundation to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data for joint analysis. We observed that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and identifies mechanisms of action, even for genes lacking direct genetic associations but significant in the context of trait-associated modules. By incorporating gene expression patterns, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework to contextualize genetic associations and explore potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies, thus advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms through a holistic approach that accounts for the complex interplay between genes and their interactions.

               We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. It is recognized that genes function together within specific contexts to perform their roles. To understand how these genes influence complex traits necessitates the acquisition of a mechanism-based comprehension of regulation across varying conditions, as this understanding is vital for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have successfully revealed individual gene contributions in disease-related mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play crucial roles in the etiology and progression of diseases. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on gene clusters with similar expression patterns under the same conditions, demonstrating that diseases are significantly associated with modules of genes expressed in relevant cell types. This approach accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and uncovers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, it has been found that important players may lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER effectively incorporates groups of co-expressed genes, providing a new framework to contextualize genetic associations and unveil potential targets missed using single-gene strategies. This approach offers valuable insights into interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

               In this study, we developed PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data in a shared latent representation for joint analysis. To understand the role of genes in complex traits, it is essential to comprehend their interactions under various conditions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been effective in uncovering individual gene impacts on disease mechanisms; however, modern models predict that genetic interactions contribute significantly to disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER uses gene expression modules as its basis, with genes having similar patterns across shared conditions. We found that diseases are associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, drug mechanisms of action, and prioritizes functionally important players in lipid regulation from trait-associated modules.

              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of

               We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that unifies gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Understanding the concerted actions of genes in specific contexts is vital to elucidating how they influence complex traits. This insight is essential for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play crucial roles in disease origination and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on gene modules with similar expression patterns across conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairings and deciphers mechanisms of action. In addition, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally crucial players lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER incorporates co-expressed gene groups to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By offering this novel framework, PhenoPLIER provides a fresh perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, ultimately enhancing our understanding of disease etiology, therapeutic targets, and drug mechanisms.

               This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Gaining insight into how genes work together in specific contexts is crucial for understanding their impact on complex traits and developing effective therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies help reveal individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in disease etiology. PhenoPLIER's approach represents genes as groups with similar expression patterns across conditions and identifies diseases associated with relevant cell types. We demonstrate accurate predictions of drug-disease pairs and the ability to infer mechanisms of action using PhenoPLIER. Furthermore, a CRISPR screen showed that functionally important players not linked through single-gene associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's novel framework allows for contextualizing genetic associations using gene co-expression groups, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and contributing to a broader understanding of disease mechanisms.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure

              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

               We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates investigating the regulation of gene expression across various conditions. This insight has proven crucial for developing new therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in identifying individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, and we observe diseases being significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. We showcase PhenoPLIER's ability to accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and elucidate mechanisms of action, as well as identifying functionally important players previously missed by single-gene strategies within trait-associated gene modules. Our CRISPR screen analysis on lipid regulation supports this notion, prioritizing genes that lack associations but are vital in relevant contexts. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene approaches. As such, PhenoPLIER provides a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

               Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns is a valuable approach for understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions, influencing complex traits. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in relevant mechanisms, but modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in diseases. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By representing modules with similar gene expression patterns, we find that diseases are associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and drug mechanisms of action. PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players in trait-associated modules without explicit associations. In conclusion, this novel framework incorporates gene expression patterns to contextualize genetic associations, providing an alternative way of interpreting them, especially for complex traits that involve numerous genes and interactions.

              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression

              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and

              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring

               We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach, which aims to bridge the gap between genetic studies and pharmacological perturbation data. This innovative method enables a joint analysis by mapping gene-trait associations into a shared latent representation. It is essential to understand how genes collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions, and determining the impact of these interactions on complex traits requires a deep comprehension of the regulation of gene expression across diverse conditions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in revealing individual genes' role in disease mechanisms; however, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in the development and progression of diseases. PhenoPLIER is based on modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns under identical conditions, as opposed to solely focusing on single-genes. We have observed significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and identifies the mechanisms of action. By analyzing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we uncover essential players that are functionally important but lack direct genetic association connections, yet can be prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, this framework incorporating groups of co-expressed genes allows for contextualizing genetic associations, thus revealing potential targets that may not have been captured through single-gene strategies. By using PhenoPLIER, we introduce a novel method to interpret and leverage genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and their complex interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               The paper introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. In the broader context of understanding complex traits and disease etiology, there is a gap in the literature regarding how gene interactions contribute to these processes. Existing transcriptome-wide association studies have primarily focused on single genes' roles in disease mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial for understanding complex trait architectures. Addressing this issue, PhenoPLIER represents genetic associations based on modules of co-expressed genes across specific conditions. The approach demonstrates significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms. It also highlights the importance of functionally important players missed by single-gene strategies but prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules. The conclusion emphasizes that PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations through gene co-expression, revealing previously overlooked potential targets for drug repurposing and therapeutic development.

               We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that unites gene-trait associations and pharmacological data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach enables a deeper understanding of gene function in the context of specific conditions related to complex traits. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms; however, modern models emphasize the significance of gene-gene interactions in the origin and progression of diseases. By modeling genes as modules based on similar expression patterns across conditions, PhenoPLIER associates diseases with gene sets expressed in relevant cell types accurately predicts drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Our work suggests that PhenoPLIER can identify potentially missed targets by prioritizing co-expressed genes over single-gene strategies. Overall, this novel framework facilitates interpretation of genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, aiding in revealing hidden therapeutic targets.

              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights

              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting

               Genes often collaborate within specific contexts to perform their functions, and elucidating how they influence complex traits necessitates understanding expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is essential for developing new therapies. Our study reveals that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while also inferring mechanisms of action. Through a CRISPR screen examining lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players with no direct associations were prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations using co-expressed genes and unveil potential targets previously missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework provides a means to interpret genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, enabling deeper insight into disease etiology and therapeutic mechanisms.

               Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions, and determining how they influence complex traits requires a thorough understanding of gene expression regulation. This knowledge is crucial for the development of new therapies. In this study, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and uncovers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

               Genes interact in specific contexts to carry out their functions, playing a vital role in regulating gene expression and influencing complex traits. This insight is crucial for developing new therapies, particularly in understanding the connections between diseases, drugs, and their mechanisms of action. In this study, we demonstrate that genetically linked diseases are significantly associated with groups of co-expressed genes in relevant cell types. Using our method called PhenoPLIER, we accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and reveal their mechanisms of action. By incorporating these gene modules into our analysis, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and identifies potential targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene strategies. Our novel framework paves the way for interpreting complex genetic data through gene expression patterns.

               Genes collaboratively contribute to complex traits through their coordinated expression in specific contexts. To fully understand this, we need to delve into the regulation of gene expression across different conditions. This insight is essential for developing effective therapies. In this study, we demonstrated that diseases are strongly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while uncovering mechanisms of action. By employing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we found that functional players with no direct association are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Ultimately, PhenoPLIER utilizes groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and identify potential targets previously overlooked by single-gene strategies. Through this novel framework, PhenoPLIER enables a comprehensive examination of genetic associations via gene modules, thereby enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               Genes work together to carry out their functions in specific contexts, influencing complex traits and requiring a deeper understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. Such knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapies. Our study revealed that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players may lack associations but were prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating co-expressed genes into PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and highlights targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework offers a new perspective on interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene expression patterns, advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               Genes collaborate within specific contexts to carry out their functions, necessitating a deep understanding of gene expression regulation across diverse conditions. This insight is crucial for developing effective therapies targeting complex traits. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly connected to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease associations as well as mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we find that functionally essential players may lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER utilizes co-expressed gene groups to contextualize genetic connections and reveal overlooked targets that may not be recognized through single-gene strategies. This framework offers a novel approach for interpreting genetic associations via the lens of gene modules, thus advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions, necessitating a deep understanding of gene expression regulation across diverse conditions. This knowledge is vital for developing novel therapies and addressing the role of genes in complex traits. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play significant roles in disease origins and progression. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that combines gene-trait associations, pharmacological perturbation data, and gene expression patterns to uncover the underlying genetic connections within diseases. This technique accurately predicts drug-disease pairs, identifies disease mechanisms, and prioritizes functionally important genes not originally associated with traits, ultimately bridging the gap in understanding complex trait etiology and drug actions.

               Genes often work in collaboration with one another, carrying out their functions within specific contexts. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates comprehending expression regulation across different conditions. This understanding is vital for developing new therapeutic strategies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the roles of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play crucial roles in determining the origin and progression of complex diseases. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational tool which maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is constructed using modules consisting of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action.

               Genes often work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions, impacting complex traits. To understand how these genes contribute to disease-related mechanisms requires understanding gene regulation of expression across different conditions. This insight is crucial for developing new therapies. Previous research has focused on individual gene associations through transcriptome-wide studies; however, modern models predict the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression. To address these limitations, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that utilizes modules based on genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions to analyze genetic associations with diseases, pharmacological perturbations, and infer drug mechanisms. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, disease-associated gene modules, and functionally important players without significant prior connections but prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-related modules through CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation.

               Genes often collaborate with one another in specific contexts to execute their functions, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of how these genes contribute to complex traits. The elucidation of this relationship is crucial for devising new therapies and targeting disease mechanisms. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in disease-relevant processes. Modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in the development and progression of complex traits. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that merges gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation utilizes modules consisting of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly connected to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER is adept at predicting known drug-disease associations as well as uncovering their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen studying lipid regulation, we find that functionally critical players may lack direct associations but can be prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER due to shared expression patterns across relevant conditions.

               Genes collaborate to perform functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits requires insight into expression regulation. Uncovering the role of genes in disease-relevant mechanisms is vital for developing new therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have unveiled individual gene effects, modern models emphasize the importance of gene-gene interactions for disease etiology. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data into a common representation based on gene expression patterns. Our approach identifies significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, it accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and deciphers mechanisms of action. In addition to its effectiveness, PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players in trait-associated modules that may lack associations but are crucial for lipid regulation.

            Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
            their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex
            traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
            across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
            the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
            to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER.

            text: ' Genes collaboratively contribute to intricate functional processes, necessitating a deeper comprehension of how they impact complex traits. Understanding the expression regulation of genes in varying contexts is imperative for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms, modern architectural models emphasize the significance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression. To address this complexity, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational tool that incorporates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent space representation for integrated analysis. This approach utilizes modules based on genes sharing expression patterns across conditions, which enables us to identify disease associations with relevant cell types and accurately predict known drug-disease pairs. Additionally, our method can infer mechanisms of action. Using CRISPR screens in lipid regulation research, we observe that essential players are not necessarily associated directly but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting its utility in revealing functional relationships and guiding therapeutic development.'

               Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts, influencing complex traits and disease mechanisms. Determining how gene expression affects these conditions requires understanding the regulation of genes across various settings. While transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms, modern complex trait models suggest gene interactions are crucial for understanding disease etiology and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that combines gene-trait associations, drug perturbation data, and gene expression patterns into a shared latent representation. This approach facilitates joint analysis using gene modules with similar expression across conditions in relevant cell types. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with these gene modules. Additionally, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, uncovers mechanisms of action, and prioritizes functionally important genes lacking direct associations in trait-associated modules through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure
              and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits
              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

               Genes collaborate to execute their functions within specific contexts, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for developing effective therapies and elucidating the mechanisms underlying disease etiology. While transcriptome-wide association studies have provided insights into individual genes' roles in disease-related processes, it has become evident that gene-gene interactions play a vital part in disease development and progression according to modern models of complex trait architecture. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER - a computational approach that unites genetic associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This framework is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across multiple conditions. Our findings show that diseases have significant correlations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and deciphers their mechanisms of action. Through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we discover that genes without direct associations but are crucial players are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

               Genes often collaborate to execute their functions in specific circumstances. To comprehend how these genes influence complex traits, we need an understanding of gene expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed individual genes' roles in disease-related mechanisms, recent models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease onset and progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that combines gene-trait associations, pharmacological perturbation data, and a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns under the same conditions, we observe diseases being significantly linked to relevant cell type-associated gene modules. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of action, and prioritizes functionally important players in trait-related modules that lack previous associations.

              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been
              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.
