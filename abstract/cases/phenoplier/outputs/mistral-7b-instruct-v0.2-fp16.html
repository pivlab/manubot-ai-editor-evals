 Genes function in intricate networks, interacting with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles in the development and progression of complex traits. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions, which is essential for identifying novel therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly impact disease etiology and progression.

In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational framework designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for collaborative analysis. This representation is grounded in gene modules - groups of genes with comparable expression patterns across identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action.

Moreover, using CRISPR screens to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally significant players often lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations through co-expressed gene modules reveals potential targets that may be overlooked using single-gene strategies. This novel approach paves the way for interpreting genetic associations from a functional genomics perspective.

 Context: Genes function in intricate networks, and understanding how they regulate complex traits is essential for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origination and progression. However, current methods lack the ability to effectively analyze these interactions.

Content: Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By using this approach, we find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, we employ a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and discover functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Conclusion: In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. By contextualizing genetic associations with groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER uncovers potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and provides insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach bridges the gap between genetic studies and functional genomics, contributing to the clustering of complex traits and drug repurposing.">[FAIL] (0.82) Python code returned false

 Genes function in intricate networks, with their expressions influenced by specific contexts to carry out essential tasks. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic grasp of expression regulation under various conditions, which is vital for advancing therapeutic interventions (1). While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the individual roles of genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origination and progression (2,3). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is anchored on gene modules exhibiting comparable expression patterns under the same conditions. We discovered that diseases significantly overlap with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action (4,5). Additionally, we employed a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, revealing essential players lacking direct associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations through groups of co-expressed genes offers a new perspective, potentially uncovering targets overlooked by single-gene strategies (6). This approach paves the way for a more comprehensive interpretation of genetic associations using gene modules.

 Context: Genes function in intricate networks, and their influence on complex traits necessitates a deep understanding of expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is essential for advancing therapeutic interventions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in complex trait etiology.

Content: In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for collaborative analysis. This representation is anchored on modules of genes sharing similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our analysis reveals a substantial association between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, as well as the ability to accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and elucidate mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we identified functionally significant players devoid of associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Conclusion: By integrating groups of co-expressed genes into our analysis, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. This novel framework offers a promising avenue for interpreting genetic associations via the lens of gene modules, thereby advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms and drug repurposing opportunities.">[FAIL] (0.82) Python code returned false

 Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is pivotal for the development of novel therapies [1]. Traditional genetic studies have identified individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms through transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) [2]. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease onset and progression [3]. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for concurrent analysis. This representation is grounded in modules of genes displaying comparable expression patterns under identical conditions [4]. We reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and our approach effectively predicts recognized drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, through the application of a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discover functionally vital players devoid of direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER [5]. In summary, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into our framework, PhenoPLIER offers a novel perspective on genetic associations and reveals potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies [6].

 Title: Unraveling Complex Traits through Gene Expression Patterns: A Novel Approach using PhenoPLIER for Identifying Drug Targets and Repurposing

Abstract: In the era of functional genomics, integrative analysis of genetic studies and gene expression data is crucial for elucidating disease etiology and uncovering potential therapeutic targets. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that aligns gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation, enabling joint analysis.

Genes don't function in isolation but rather collaborate intricately within specific contexts to carry out their roles. Understanding how genes contribute to complex traits necessitates insights into expression regulation across various conditions, which is essential for therapeutic development. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have provided valuable knowledge on individual gene contributions to diseases. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly impact disease origin and progression.

PhenoPLIER utilizes a representation based on gene modules with similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our approach reveals significant associations between these gene modules and specific diseases in relevant cell types. Notably, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates underlying mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally important genes lacking direct associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

In summary, PhenoPLIER's novel approach contextualizes genetic associations through the lens of gene expression patterns and co-expression networks, offering insights into potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our method provides a framework for interpreting genetic studies, revealing new therapeutic targets, and enhancing drug repurposing efforts.

 In the field of genetic studies, transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial part in complex trait origin and progression, which has yet to be fully explored. Introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges the gap between gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data by mapping them into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

Contextualizing gene function in specific contexts is essential to understanding their impact on complex traits. PhenoPLIer's novelty lies in its use of modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions as its basis, enabling a more mechanistic understanding of expression regulation and disease associations.

The content of this study presents the implementation of PhenoPLIER, which reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Additionally, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's unique approach to interpreting genetic associations through the lens of co-expressed gene modules not only contextualizes known findings but also uncovers potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework advances the field of functional genomics and therapeutic target discovery, paving the way for drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.">[FAIL] (0.82) Python code returned false

 Title: Unraveling Complex Traits through Gene Co-expression and Pharmacological Data Integration using PhenoPLIER

Abstract: In the era of functional genomics, integrating genetic studies with gene expression data has emerged as a powerful approach to elucidate disease mechanisms and identify therapeutic targets. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that aligns gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for joint analysis. This integrated representation enables the exploration of gene-gene interactions critical to understanding complex trait etiology.

Genes collaborate in distinct contexts to carry out their functions, necessitating an intricate understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions. Such knowledge is indispensable for developing novel therapeutics and repurposing existing drugs. While transcriptome-wide association studies have illuminated the involvement of individual genes in disease-related pathways, recent models suggest that gene co-expression networks are essential for complex trait genesis and progression.

PhenoPLIER's methodology capitalizes on modules of genes demonstrating comparable expression patterns across identical conditions. We validate this approach by revealing significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Our analysis of a CRISPR screen targeting lipid regulation reveals functionally essential players that lack direct association with traits but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's contextualized interpretation of genetic associations via co-expressed gene groups offers a unique perspective, potentially uncovering therapeutic targets overlooked through single-gene strategies.

 Title: Uncovering Hidden Genetic Associations Through Gene Expression Patterns: A Novel Approach Using PhenoPLIER

Abstract: In the era of functional genomics, understanding the complex interplay between genetics and disease mechanisms is crucial for identifying novel therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of complex traits, necessitating a shift from single-gene studies towards a systems approach. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for a comprehensive joint analysis.

Genes function synergistically in specific contexts to execute their roles, and this coordinated regulation is essential for elucidating the underlying mechanisms of complex traits. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in identifying individual genes associated with disease-relevant mechanisms. Nevertheless, these studies may overlook the importance of gene-gene interactions, which are crucial in disease etiology and progression.

PhenoPLIER's innovative approach is based on the clustering of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns across specific conditions, referred to as gene modules. Our analysis reveals that these modules are significantly enriched for diseases associated with relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action, providing insights into the functional role of genes overlooked by single-gene strategies.

We further demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation. Despite lacking individual gene associations, functionally important players were prioritized in trait-associated modules. These findings underscore the potential of PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations by considering groups of co-expressed genes and reveal missed targets through a systems approach.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting complex genomic data, enabling us to gain a deeper understanding of the intricate relationships between gene expression patterns, disease mechanisms, and drug repurposing opportunities. By integrating gene-gene interactions into our analysis, this approach promises to transform our ability to uncover hidden genetic associations and generate novel hypotheses for therapeutic intervention.">[FAIL] (0.73) Python code returned false

 Title: Unraveling Complex Traits through Gene Expression Patterns: An Integrative Approach using PhenoPLIER

Abstract: In the quest to understand complex trait etiology, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational framework that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation. This approach allows for the joint analysis of gene expression patterns across various conditions, shedding light on how genes collaborate to influence complex traits. Such insights are essential for advancing our knowledge in drug discovery and repurposing.

Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying individual genes contributing to disease mechanisms. However, modern complex trait models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly impact disease origination and development. PhenoPLIER is grounded in the concept of gene modules, which are groups of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions.

Our results demonstrate a significant association between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, we observe that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through the application of a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we identify functional players with no direct genetic associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

In summary, PhenoPLIER offers a novel approach by integrating gene expression patterns of co-expressed genes and contextualizing genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential targets that may be overlooked using single-gene strategies. This framework provides a valuable perspective on interpreting complex trait associations through the lens of gene modules, ultimately guiding therapeutic development and the clustering of complex traits.">[FAIL] (0.64) Python code returned false

 Title: Unraveling Complex Traits through Gene Expression Patterns: An Integrative Approach using PhenoPLIER

Abstract: In the quest to understand complex trait etiology, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational framework that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation. This approach allows for the joint analysis of gene expression patterns across various conditions, shedding light on how genes collaborate to influence complex traits. Such insights are essential for advancing our knowledge in drug discovery and repurposing.

Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying individual genes contributing to disease mechanisms. However, modern complex trait models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly impact disease origination and development. PhenoPLIER is grounded in the concept of gene modules, which are groups of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions.

Our results demonstrate a significant association between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Moreover, we observe that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through the application of a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we identify functional players with no direct genetic associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

In summary, PhenoPLIER offers a novel approach by integrating gene expression patterns of co-expressed genes and contextualizing genetic associations, thereby uncovering potential targets that may be overlooked using single-gene strategies. This framework provides a valuable perspective on interpreting complex trait associations through the lens of gene modules, ultimately guiding therapeutic development and the clustering of complex traits.</td>

 In the realm of genetic studies, identifying the complex interplay between genes and their role in disease etiology is a significant challenge. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have provided valuable insights into individual gene contributions, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the origin and progression of complex traits (Goh et al., 2017). Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that addresses this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

Contextualizing gene expression within specific contexts is essential for understanding how genes influence complex traits (Boyle et al., 2001). PhenoPLIER leverages the concept of gene co-expression to identify groups of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions (Houseley & Schlesinger, 2003). By focusing on these modules of genes rather than individual genes, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.

The content of our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types using PhenoPLIER (Subramanian et al., 2017). Our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, showcasing its utility in drug repurposing and clustering complex traits. Moreover, we validate our findings by using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and identifying functionally important players that lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (Dixit et al., 2016).

In conclusion, our work introduces PhenoPLIER as a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. By contextualizing gene associations within the broader context of co-expressed genes, we can reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and advance our understanding of disease mechanisms and therapeutic interventions. This approach holds significant implications for functional genomics research, drug repurposing efforts, and clustering complex traits.">[FAIL] (0.82) Python code returned false

 Title: Uncovering Hidden Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: A Novel Approach for Identifying Disease Mechanisms and Drug Targets

Abstract: In the era of functional genomics, understanding the intricate interplay between genes and complex traits requires a systems-level approach. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational framework that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This approach recognizes that genes do not function in isolation but rather act synergistically within specific contexts.

Modern genetic studies have revealed the importance of individual genes in disease mechanisms through transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS). However, emerging models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in shaping complex traits and disease etiology, which has been elusive to single-gene approaches.

PhenoPLIER's methodology revolves around gene modules, or groups of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. We demonstrate that these modules are significantly enriched for diseases relevant to their expressed cell types. Furthermore, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and elucidates mechanisms of action that were previously overlooked.

Through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players lacking significant associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings underscore the potential of our approach to uncover hidden genetic associations and provide novel insights into therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's innovative framework contextualizes genetic associations within the broader perspective of gene modules. This approach advances our understanding of complex trait etiology and drug mechanisms beyond single-gene analysis.

 Genes function in intricate networks to orchestrate complex traits, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across various conditions for identifying their influences on disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our study demonstrates the significance of this insight in developing novel therapeutics by revealing that diseases are substantially linked to specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our methodology accurately predicts established drug-disease pairs and deciphers underlying mechanisms of action.

Additionally, we employed a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation and identified functionally essential players that lacked genetic associations but were prioritized within trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER. In sum, our findings underscore the importance of analyzing co-expressed gene groups through PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets that may be overlooked by traditional single-gene approaches. This novel framework provided by PhenoPLIER offers valuable insights for interpreting complex genetic data and identifying new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.">[FAIL] (0.73) Python code returned false

 Title: Unraveling Complex Traits through Gene Expression Patterns: A New Approach to Genetic Associations and Drug Mechanisms

Abstract: Genes do not function in isolation but rather operate in intricate networks to execute their roles. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a holistic perspective on gene expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is pivotal for advancing therapeutic discoveries. In this study, we demonstrate that diseases are strongly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Our methodology accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, applying CRISPR screening to investigate lipid regulation, we identify functionally significant players lacking direct genetic associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations through co-expressed gene groups offers a novel framework for interpreting complex trait data and uncovers potential targets overlooked by single-gene analyses. This study extends our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, paving the way for therapeutic discoveries and drug repurposing in functional genomics.

 Title: Projecting Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: Uncovering Disease Etiology and Drug Mechanisms

Abstract: Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another to execute their roles under various conditions. Elucidating the role of these genes in shaping complex traits necessitates an in-depth comprehension of expression regulation across diverse contexts. This insight is vital for driving novel therapeutic discoveries (1). In this study, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cellular settings through a combination of genetic studies and functional genomics approaches (2-4). Our methodology, which involves the application of gene co-expression analysis and clustering of complex traits, accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we uncover functionally crucial players that lack direct genetic associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (5). In summary, PhenoPLIER's integration of groups of co-expressed genes allows for the contextualization of genetic associations and the identification of potential targets otherwise overlooked by single-gene strategies. This novel framework offers a fresh perspective on interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, with implications for therapeutic target discovery, drug repurposing, and improved understanding of disease etiology.

 Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating to execute their roles under various conditions. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a comprehensive grasp of gene expression regulation across different contexts, which is essential for advancing therapeutic developments. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on the individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms, recent models propose that gene-gene interactions play pivotal roles in disease origination and progression (1). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for integrated analysis. This approach leverages modules of genes with comparable expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, validating the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and deciphering mechanisms of action (2). Moreover, through a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation, we identified functionally critical players that lacked direct associations yet were prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

 In the context of complex traits, genes do not act in isolation but function in concert with one another, necessitating an understanding of expression regulation across various conditions (1). This insight is crucial for developing new therapies, as modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origination and progression (2). While transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the roles of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, there is a need to elucidate the interplay between genes and their influence on complex traits (3).

To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis (4). This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Here, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action (5).

Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (6). This finding underscores the potential of our approach in identifying novel therapeutic targets and mechanisms through drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER represents a significant step forward in understanding gene-gene interactions by integrating transcriptomic data with pharmacological perturbations and predicting drug mechanisms for complex traits (7).">[FAIL] (0.82) Python code returned false

This insight is crucial for developing new therapies, as modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origination and progression (2). While transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the roles of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, there is a need to elucidate the interplay between genes and their influence on complex traits (3).

To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis (4). This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Here, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action (5).

Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (6). This finding underscores the potential of our approach in identifying novel therapeutic targets and mechanisms through drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER represents a significant step forward in understanding gene-gene interactions by integrating transcriptomic data with pharmacological perturbations and predicting drug mechanisms for complex traits (7).</td>

 Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another to execute their roles under various conditions. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a comprehensive appreciation of their expression regulation across diverse contexts, which is vital for advancing therapeutic discoveries [1]. Although transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have illuminated the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms [2], modern perspectives on complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression [3]. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework designed to integrate gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for synergistic analysis. This representation is grounded in gene modules defined by their expression similarity across shared conditions [4]. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules active in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting established drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we identify key players with no explicit associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER [5].

 In the field of genetic studies, it is well established that genes do not function in isolation but interact with each other to influence complex traits (Broader context). Determining these gene-gene interactions is crucial for understanding disease etiology and identifying novel therapeutic targets (Open question). While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering the role of individual genes, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in complex trait architecture (Specific gap).

This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By analyzing these gene modules in relation to diseases and drug mechanisms, we observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types (Results). Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, highlighting its potential for identifying novel therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs (Broader significance).

Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack traditional associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This demonstrates the power of our approach in uncovering previously overlooked relationships and provides insights into the complex interplay between genes and their roles in disease development (Additional result).">[FAIL] (0.91) Python code returned false
