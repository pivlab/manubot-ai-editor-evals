Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "In recent years, studies have shown that understanding complex traits requires a mechanistic examination of gene expression regulation across various conditions (context). However, modern models predict that interactions between genes play an essential role in disease origin and progression. Consequently, there is a gap in the literature regarding the analysis of gene-gene interactions to uncover new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities (specific gap). This study aims to address this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By identifying modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions (method), our method reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types (results). Additionally, we demonstrate its accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action (broader significance). Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, our approach can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies (C-C-C scheme) by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes through a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through gene modules."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "Genes work together in complex networks to perform their functions, with understanding this mechanism being crucial for developing new therapies. However, determining how these genes influence complex traits requires more than individual gene analysis; it necessitates a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This represents modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, revealing significant correlations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our results show that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes through PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and contextualizing them within gene modules, which could potentially reveal missed targets for drug repurposing strategies."

We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules."

          "output": "In recent years, advances in functional genomics have shed light on the complex interplay between genes in orchestrating their functions (context). However, to fully understand how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions (content; method introduction). This is crucial for developing novel therapies and transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly towards uncovering the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms (connection between gap and broader context). Nevertheless, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in the origin and progression of complex traits (context).\n\nTo address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER - a novel computational approach for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation suitable for joint analysis (content; method presentation). This is achieved by incorporating modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in specific cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs as well as mechanisms of action (content; results). Furthermore, we utilized a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, discovering that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated gene modules.\n\nIn conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes through the lens of gene modules provides new insights into genetic associations and uncovers potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies (C-C). By expanding our understanding of complex traits using this novel framework, we can enhance precision medicine approaches in drug repurposing and disease etiology."

          "output": "In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes collaborate with each other to execute their functions in specific contexts is critical for predicting complex trait development and identifying potential therapeutic targets (context). However, traditional methods such as transcriptome-wide association studies have limitations in capturing gene-gene interactions due to single-gene approaches. Consequently, a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions remains elusive. This knowledge gap critically impedes drug repurposing efforts and the discovery of new therapies for diseases like cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (specific gap).\n\nTo address this issue, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps genetic associations with phenotypic traits and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This novel method leverages gene modules characterized by similar expression patterns across specific conditions to provide insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms (content).\n\nPhenoPLIER identifies significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring their mechanisms of action. Moreover, we demonstrate its utility by using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation; PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players in trait-associated modules that are not associated with the disease (conclusions).\n\nIn conclusion, incorporating gene modules with co-expressed genes enables the contextualization of genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By using PhenoPLIER, we can identify new therapeutic opportunities for complex diseases and advance our understanding of their etiology and drug mechanisms."

          "output": "We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational strategy that integrates gene expression data with pharmacological perturbation information to facilitate a joint analysis of complex traits and drug mechanisms. By examining how genes act together in distinct contexts, we uncover their functional roles in influencing these traits. This knowledge is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Recent transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' contributions to disease etiology; however, modern models predict that gene interactions play a vital role in complex trait origins and progression.\n\nPhenoPLIER builds upon modules of co-expressed genes with consistent patterns across related conditions. We demonstrate significant associations between diseases and these gene expression units, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating their underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of functionally important players in lipid regulation that are prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules but lack associations.\n\nIn conclusion, our approach integrates co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal missed potential targets for drug repurposing. By utilizing PhenoPLIER's framework, we uncover novel insights into complex traits and disease etiology while providing a valuable tool for functional genomics research."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

          "output": "This research fills an existing gap in our understanding of complex traits by integrating functional genomics, transcriptome-wide association studies, and drug repurposing methods to gain insight into disease etiology and therapeutic mechanisms. To address this question, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data onto common latent representations for joint analysis. By considering the concerted actions of genes within specific contexts, our study highlights how understanding expression regulation across various conditions is critical to developing new therapies. \n\nPhenoPLIER's method relies on modules of co-expressed genes with similar patterns in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs based on this mechanism. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players are prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated gene modules while lacking associations. \n\nIn conclusion, through the contextualization of genetic associations with groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting complex traits and unveils potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. This research emphasizes that integrating functional genomics with drug repurposing can advance our understanding of disease etiology and identify new therapeutic mechanisms, thus filling an important gap in the current literature on genetic studies and functional genomics."

          "output": "We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach designed to integrate gene expression data with pharmacological perturbation information into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By considering gene co-expression patterns in various contexts, we can better understand how genes work together to influence complex traits. This understanding is crucial for the development of new therapies and has been shown to be pivotal through transcriptome-wide association studies uncovering individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that gene interactions play a critical role in diseases' origin and progression.\n\nPhenoPLIER employs modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions to project genetic associations and drug repurposing opportunities. By identifying disease-associated gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrate that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation.\n\nIn conclusion, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes through PhenoPLIER, we can contextualize genetic associations and unveil potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework enables the interpretation of genetic relationships within gene modules, providing valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "We fill an existing gap in knowledge within genetic studies and functional genomics by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene expression patterns into a common latent representation for joint analysis with pharmacological perturbation data. By identifying co-expressed genes and their corresponding functions, we gain insight into how complex traits are influenced by multiple genes acting together to perform their biological roles. This knowledge is crucial for developing new therapies targeting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nPhenoPLIER identifies gene modules expressing similar patterns across relevant cell types in diseases, which demonstrates significant associations with the associated genetic variants. Additionally, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action by analyzing transcriptome-wide association studies data. We further validate PhenoPLIER's findings using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, finding that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules but lack associations.\n\nIn conclusion, we propose an innovative framework to interpret genetic associations and identify potential drug targets through the lens of gene modules by leveraging co-expression patterns. PhenoPLIER significantly contributes to understanding disease etiology, providing novel therapeutic targets, and enabling drug repurposing efforts for complex traits."

          "output": "This manuscript aims to address a significant gap in our understanding of complex traits and drug mechanisms, which is the crucial role of gene co-expression in determining disease etiology and treatment efficacy. Traditional single-gene approaches often overlook this critical aspect of gene function, leading to suboptimal therapeutic outcomes. By utilizing PhenoPLIER - a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis - we are able to better understand the complex interplay between genes in different contexts and how these interactions influence disease progression and drug efficacy.\n\nOur study reveals that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, which is crucial information for identifying novel therapeutic targets. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action by mapping complex trait associations to individual genes within these co-expression clusters. Further, using a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules but lack associations themselves - suggesting that PhenoPLIER's gene module approach is effective at identifying potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, our work provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene co-expression and highlights its broader significance for drug repurposing efforts. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into research on complex traits and therapeutics, we can better understand disease etiology and develop targeted treatments with improved efficacy."

By considering how genes function collectively rather than individually, our approach emphasizes the importance of understanding their expression regulation across diverse conditions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms; however, modern models suggest that gene interactions play an essential role in the origin and progression of complex diseases.\n\nPhenoPLIER's innovative strategy is based on modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across distinct conditions. We demonstrate significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, supporting our ability to predict known drug-disease pairs accurately and infer disease mechanisms through the analysis of transcriptomic data. Moreover, we utilize a CRISPR screen targeting lipid regulation to identify functionally important players that are prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes enables contextually relevant genetic associations, providing novel insights into potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. By utilizing the power of gene module analysis with PhenoPLIER, we offer a revolutionary framework for interpreting genetic associations and uncovering new drug repurposing opportunities in various disease etiologies."

Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

To gain insight into how these genes contribute to complex traits, it's essential to understand the expression regulation across diverse conditions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Our results show that disease associations can be accurately predicted using known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by conducting a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players in trait-associated modules but found no significant association with these genes.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Further, utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally essential players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules through PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, integrating groups of co-expressed genes with PhenoPLIER allows for contextualizing genetic associations and unveils potential targets that are missed by single-gene approaches (conclusion). By applying this novel framework to interpret genetic data, PhenoPLIER offers a powerful tool in elucidating disease etiology and drug mechanisms."

The research questions stem from the need to better understand how genes collaborate with each other to regulate expression across various conditions and develop novel therapies. By determining which diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action.\n\nWe demonstrate this by conducting a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation, revealing that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER. Consequently, we find that single-gene strategies miss potential targets missed through the contextualization of genetic associations with gene modules. The novel framework provided by PhenoPLIER offers a unique interpretation of genetic associations and may significantly contribute to drug repurposing efforts in addressing complex diseases. In conclusion, this study highlights how integrating groups of co-expressed genes can illuminate undiscovered therapeutic mechanisms and further advance our understanding of genetic studies and functional genomics."

          "output": "In recent years, functional genomics has emerged as an essential approach to better understand complex traits linked with various diseases (context). However, there is still a gap in our knowledge regarding how gene expression patterns contribute to disease etiology and drug mechanisms (gap), which hinders the development of effective therapies (matter). \n\nTo address this gap, we developed PhenoPLIER - a novel method that identifies co-expressed genes across different conditions for better understanding genetic associations (content) and predicting therapeutic targets. Our study reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs as well as infers mechanisms of action (results). Moreover, the analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen showed functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules.\n\nIn conclusion, through incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies (significance). This novel framework will significantly advance our understanding of complex traits and contribute to drug repurposing efforts for the benefit of patients worldwide."

To comprehend the complex traits influenced by these genes requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions. It is crucial for developing novel therapies that this insight has been demonstrated. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene roles in disease-related mechanisms; however, modern models predicting gene-gene interactions as critical contributors to the origin and progression of complex traits remain unexplored.\n\nWe introduce PhenoPLIER - a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data onto a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is built upon modules comprising genes with similar expression patterns across specific conditions, thereby enabling comprehensive understanding of disease etiology. We observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action.\n\nMoreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the potential for leveraging gene co-expression patterns to project genetic associations, unveil therapeutic targets, and facilitate drug repurposing in complex diseases."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

PhenoPLIER successfully predicts known drug-disease pairs, revealing mechanisms of action while uncovering novel therapeutic targets through a CRISPR screen analysis.\n\nOur results highlight that gene co-expression can help identify potential therapeutic targets in complex diseases (e.g., lipid regulation), and the findings contribute to an improved understanding of disease etiology and inform drug repurposing strategies. These advancements not only fill existing gaps within genetic studies but also provide a novel framework for functional genomics, ultimately enabling more precise treatments tailored to individual patient needs."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": "Genetic studies play a vital role in understanding complex traits and their etiology (disease origin). However, current approaches often fail to capture the full complexity of gene interactions involved in these traits due to limited ability to discern co-expression patterns among genes within diverse contexts. Functional genomics has been proposed as a solution, but requires an improved method for identifying key drug targets and repurposing strategies based on gene expression data.\n\nPhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach introduced in this manuscript that maps transcriptome data into latent representations of gene-trait associations, enabling joint analysis with pharmacological perturbation information. By employing modules of genes with similar expression patterns across specific conditions, PhenoPLIER allows for the identification and interpretation of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nWe demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER through several case studies involving various diseases, where it accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and infers novel mechanisms of action. In a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated gene modules identified by PhenoPLIER despite their lack of direct association with the traits being studied.\n\nOverall, this research addresses an essential gap in understanding complex disease etiology and drug mechanisms by providing improved methods for identifying key genes involved in these processes. It holds significant potential for furthering our knowledge on therapeutic targets and drug repurposing strategies, ultimately contributing to advancements in personalized medicine."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": "The genetic study of complex traits has long been an area of great interest due to its potential for understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However, traditional approaches have had limited success in identifying the underlying gene co-expression patterns that contribute to these traits. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER - a novel computational approach for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By utilizing modules of genes with similar expression patterns across relevant cell types, our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we demonstrate that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings highlight the importance of gene co-expression patterns in disease etiology and provide valuable insights for drug repurposing strategies."

To understand how these genes contribute to complex traits requires a comprehensive understanding of gene expression regulation across diverse conditions. This insight is crucial for developing novel therapies, as demonstrated by transcriptome-wide association studies in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant part in determining disease etiology and progression.\n\nWe introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach aimed at mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions, this method uncovers disease associations with gene expression patterns in relevant cell types and effectively predicts known drug-disease pairs as well as mechanisms of action.\n\nBy using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This suggests the potential for repurposing drugs based on gene co-expression patterns, highlighting an innovative approach towards understanding disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Despite advances such as transcriptome-wide association studies, our knowledge remains fragmented and incomplete due to insufficient attention given to gene co-expression patterns. Modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are critical in elucidating disease etiology and progression.\n\nPhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach introduced here, which maps gene-trait associations onto a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By analyzing data from transcriptome-wide association studies and known drug-disease pairs, we demonstrate its accuracy in predicting disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets for drug repurposing.\n\nFurthermore, by leveraging CRISPR screening technology, we reveal that functionally important players in trait regulation are prioritized within modules predicted by PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the potential of this approach to bridge the gap between genetic studies and functional genomics, ultimately illuminating the underlying mechanisms involved in complex traits and guiding therapeutic development."

              "text": "In recent years, studies have shown that understanding complex traits requires a mechanistic examination of gene expression regulation across various conditions (context). However, modern models predict that interactions between genes play an essential role in disease origin and progression. Consequently, there is a gap in the literature regarding the analysis of gene-gene interactions to uncover new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities (specific gap). This study aims to address this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By identifying modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions (method), our method reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types (results). Additionally, we demonstrate its accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action (broader significance). Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, our approach can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies (C-C-C scheme) by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes through a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through gene modules.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

              "text": "Genes work together in complex networks to perform their functions, with understanding this mechanism being crucial for developing new therapies. However, determining how these genes influence complex traits requires more than individual gene analysis; it necessitates a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This represents modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, revealing significant correlations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our results show that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes through PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and contextualizing them within gene modules, which could potentially reveal missed targets for drug repurposing strategies.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

However, to fully understand how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions (content; method introduction). This is crucial for developing novel therapies and transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly towards uncovering the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms (connection between gap and broader context). Nevertheless, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in the origin and progression of complex traits (context).\n\nTo address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER - a novel computational approach for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation suitable for joint analysis (content; method presentation). This is achieved by incorporating modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in specific cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs as well as mechanisms of action (content; results). Furthermore, we utilized a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, discovering that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated gene modules.\n\nIn conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes through the lens of gene modules provides new insights into genetic associations and uncovers potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies (C-C). By expanding our understanding of complex traits using this novel framework, we can enhance precision medicine approaches in drug repurposing and disease etiology.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

However, traditional methods such as transcriptome-wide association studies have limitations in capturing gene-gene interactions due to single-gene approaches. Consequently, a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions remains elusive. This knowledge gap critically impedes drug repurposing efforts and the discovery of new therapies for diseases like cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (specific gap).\n\nTo address this issue, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps genetic associations with phenotypic traits and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This novel method leverages gene modules characterized by similar expression patterns across specific conditions to provide insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms (content).\n\nPhenoPLIER identifies significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring their mechanisms of action. Moreover, we demonstrate its utility by using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation; PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players in trait-associated modules that are not associated with the disease (conclusions).\n\nIn conclusion, incorporating gene modules with co-expressed genes enables the contextualization of genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By using PhenoPLIER, we can identify new therapeutic opportunities for complex diseases and advance our understanding of their etiology and drug mechanisms.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.

It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

To address this question, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data onto common latent representations for joint analysis. By considering the concerted actions of genes within specific contexts, our study highlights how understanding expression regulation across various conditions is critical to developing new therapies. \n\nPhenoPLIER's method relies on modules of co-expressed genes with similar patterns in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs based on this mechanism. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players are prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated gene modules while lacking associations. \n\nIn conclusion, through the contextualization of genetic associations with groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting complex traits and unveils potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. This research emphasizes that integrating functional genomics with drug repurposing can advance our understanding of disease etiology and identify new therapeutic mechanisms, thus filling an important gap in the current literature on genetic studies and functional genomics.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

By identifying co-expressed genes and their corresponding functions, we gain insight into how complex traits are influenced by multiple genes acting together to perform their biological roles. This knowledge is crucial for developing new therapies targeting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nPhenoPLIER identifies gene modules expressing similar patterns across relevant cell types in diseases, which demonstrates significant associations with the associated genetic variants. Additionally, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action by analyzing transcriptome-wide association studies data. We further validate PhenoPLIER's findings using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, finding that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules but lack associations.\n\nIn conclusion, we propose an innovative framework to interpret genetic associations and identify potential drug targets through the lens of gene modules by leveraging co-expression patterns. PhenoPLIER significantly contributes to understanding disease etiology, providing novel therapeutic targets, and enabling drug repurposing efforts for complex traits.",

The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

Traditional single-gene approaches often overlook this critical aspect of gene function, leading to suboptimal therapeutic outcomes. By utilizing PhenoPLIER - a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis - we are able to better understand the complex interplay between genes in different contexts and how these interactions influence disease progression and drug efficacy.\n\nOur study reveals that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, which is crucial information for identifying novel therapeutic targets. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action by mapping complex trait associations to individual genes within these co-expression clusters. Further, using a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules but lack associations themselves - suggesting that PhenoPLIER's gene module approach is effective at identifying potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, our work provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene co-expression and highlights its broader significance for drug repurposing efforts. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into research on complex traits and therapeutics, we can better understand disease etiology and develop targeted treatments with improved efficacy.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

By considering how genes function collectively rather than individually, our approach emphasizes the importance of understanding their expression regulation across diverse conditions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms; however, modern models suggest that gene interactions play an essential role in the origin and progression of complex diseases.\n\nPhenoPLIER's innovative strategy is based on modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across distinct conditions. We demonstrate significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, supporting our ability to predict known drug-disease pairs accurately and infer disease mechanisms through the analysis of transcriptomic data. Moreover, we utilize a CRISPR screen targeting lipid regulation to identify functionally important players that are prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes enables contextually relevant genetic associations, providing novel insights into potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

The research questions stem from the need to better understand how genes collaborate with each other to regulate expression across various conditions and develop novel therapies. By determining which diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action.\n\nWe demonstrate this by conducting a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation, revealing that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules using PhenoPLIER. Consequently, we find that single-gene strategies miss potential targets missed through the contextualization of genetic associations with gene modules. The novel framework provided by PhenoPLIER offers a unique interpretation of genetic associations and may significantly contribute to drug repurposing efforts in addressing complex diseases. In conclusion, this study highlights how integrating groups of co-expressed genes can illuminate undiscovered therapeutic mechanisms and further advance our understanding of genetic studies and functional genomics.",

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

However, determining how these genes contribute to disease etiology remains a challenge due to the absence of mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions (e.g., drug repurposing). Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover individual gene roles in disease mechanisms but overlook gene-gene interactions crucial for disease origin and progression.\n\nHere, we introduce PhenoPLIER - a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation suitable for joint analysis of complex traits (e.g., drug repurposing). This approach is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions and enables identification of disease associations with specific cell types. PhenoPLIER successfully predicts known drug-disease pairs, revealing mechanisms of action while uncovering novel therapeutic targets through a CRISPR screen analysis.\n\nOur results highlight that gene co-expression can help identify potential therapeutic targets in complex diseases (e.g., lipid regulation), and the findings contribute to an improved understanding of disease etiology and inform drug repurposing strategies. These advancements not only fill existing gaps within genetic studies but also provide a novel framework for functional genomics, ultimately enabling more precise treatments tailored to individual patient needs.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.

We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

However, current approaches often fail to capture the full complexity of gene interactions involved in these traits due to limited ability to discern co-expression patterns among genes within diverse contexts. Functional genomics has been proposed as a solution, but requires an improved method for identifying key drug targets and repurposing strategies based on gene expression data.\n\nPhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach introduced in this manuscript that maps transcriptome data into latent representations of gene-trait associations, enabling joint analysis with pharmacological perturbation information. By employing modules of genes with similar expression patterns across specific conditions, PhenoPLIER allows for the identification and interpretation of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nWe demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER through several case studies involving various diseases, where it accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and infers novel mechanisms of action. In a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated gene modules identified by PhenoPLIER despite their lack of direct association with the traits being studied.\n\nOverall, this research addresses an essential gap in understanding complex disease etiology and drug mechanisms by providing improved methods for identifying key genes involved in these processes. It holds significant potential for furthering our knowledge on therapeutic targets and drug repurposing strategies, ultimately contributing to advancements in personalized medicine.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Despite advances such as transcriptome-wide association studies, our knowledge remains fragmented and incomplete due to insufficient attention given to gene co-expression patterns. Modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are critical in elucidating disease etiology and progression.\n\nPhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach introduced here, which maps gene-trait associations onto a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By analyzing data from transcriptome-wide association studies and known drug-disease pairs, we demonstrate its accuracy in predicting disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets for drug repurposing.\n\nFurthermore, by leveraging CRISPR screening technology, we reveal that functionally important players in trait regulation are prioritized within modules predicted by PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the potential of this approach to bridge the gap between genetic studies and functional genomics, ultimately illuminating the underlying mechanisms involved in complex traits and guiding therapeutic development.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",
