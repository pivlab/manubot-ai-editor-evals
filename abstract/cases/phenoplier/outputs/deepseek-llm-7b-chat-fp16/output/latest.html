Genes collaborate in harmony to perform their functions within specific contexts. To fully comprehend how these genes contribute to complex traits, an understanding of expression regulation across various conditions is essential. This knowledge has been crucial in developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have identified the roles individual genes play in disease mechanisms, yet modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are vital for disease origin and progression.

PhenoPLIER, a computational approach introduced here, maps gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation suitable for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes sharing similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with cell type-specific gene modules and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action.

By employing CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes allows for the contextualization of genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed through single-gene strategies. The PhenoPLIER framework provides a novel perspective on interpreting genetic relationships through gene module analysis, offering valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.">[FAIL] (0.88) Python code returned false

Genetic studies have long been instrumental in uncovering complex traits and their underlying mechanisms. Functional genomics has emerged as a powerful tool to better understand how genes interact with each other, specifically during different conditions. However, understanding these interactions is crucial for developing new therapies that target specific disease-associated gene modules rather than individual genes alone.

PhenoPLIER aims to address this challenge by leveraging transcriptome-wide association studies and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on gene co-expression patterns across relevant cell types. By doing so, it can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action for disease etiology and progression.

To further validate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER, we conducted a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation to identify functionally important players in trait-associated modules. Our findings demonstrate that these key gene modules are prioritized by PhenoPLIER even when they lack associations within individual genes. Thus, using this approach provides an innovative framework for interpreting genetic associations and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. In conclusion, through the integration of co-expressed groups of genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and offers a novel method to understand complex traits, potentially leading to improved drug repurposing strategies in various diseases.">[FAIL] (0.88) Python code returned false

The complex interplay among genes in specific contexts is crucial for their functions. To comprehend how these genes contribute to intricate traits necessitates an understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions. It has been demonstrated that gaining this insight is essential for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role played by individual genes in disease mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are vital for both disease origins and progression. 

Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational strategy to map gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation suitable for joint analysis. This approach is based on modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns across identical conditions. We discovered that diseases are strongly linked with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and found our technique accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs, as well as uncovering mechanisms underlying their actions. In addition, we employed a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, discovering that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

In summary, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns helps contextualize genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic relationships and identifying drug repurposing opportunities that can benefit complex diseases.">[FAIL] (0.88) Python code returned false

In this manuscript, we sought to bridge the gap between existing functional genomics studies and genetic association analyses in complex traits. Specifically, we aimed to address an open question about how gene co-expression patterns can be leveraged to uncover disease etiology and drug mechanisms that traditional single-gene approaches miss. To do so, we developed PhenoPLIER - a novel computational method for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into common latent representations of gene modules with similar expression patterns across different conditions.

Our findings show that by using this approach, we can identify significant correlations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and reveals mechanisms of action for therapeutic targets. To further validate our method, we conducted a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, identifying functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules.

In conclusion, the results from this study indicate that integrating groups of co-expressed genes using the PhenoPLIER framework contextualizes genetic associations and can uncover potential targets for drug repurposing efforts. This research has broad implications for understanding complex traits, revealing novel therapeutic opportunities, and advancing the field by closing a gap between functional genomics studies and genetic association analyses in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.">[FAIL] (0.88) Python code returned false

This manuscript presents PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational method to investigate the role of genes in complex traits and elucidate drug mechanisms by mapping gene-trait relationships onto common latent representations based on co-expression patterns. It is essential to understand how genetic associations contribute to disease etiology and identify potential therapeutic targets for effective treatment. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped discover individual gene roles, but modern models predict that gene interactions are crucial in complex traits. PhenoPLIER's approach utilizes gene modules exhibiting similar expression profiles across relevant cell types to project disease associations and drug mechanisms.

The study finds substantial associations between diseases and co-expressed gene modules and demonstrates the capability of predicting known drug-disease pairs accurately. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis revealed that functionally important players in lipid regulation were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER but lacked direct associations, suggesting missed targets for single-gene strategies. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes through the PhenoPLIER framework helps contextualize genetic associations and unveils potential therapeutic targets not identified with traditional methods. This novel approach provides a comprehensive understanding of gene interactions in complex traits and drug repurposing by elucidating molecular mechanisms underlying diseases.">[FAIL] (0.75) Python code returned false

This paper addresses an existing gap in literature on functional genomics, focusing on how genes interact with each other to influence complex traits and disease etiology. Our work builds upon transcriptome-wide association studies that have uncovered individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms. However, we aim to go beyond the current understanding by taking into account gene interactions using a computational approach called PhenoPLIER.

It uses modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions to elucidate disease etiology, drug mechanisms, and repurposing opportunities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by showing significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, as well as accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs and their underlying mechanisms. Additionally, we identify key players in lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen that lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules according to PhenoPLIER's analysis.

In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context for genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies in drug repurposing.

In this study, we employed a novel approach called gene co-expression analysis, which helped us identify disease associations through patterns of gene expression across diverse conditions. Our findings suggest that utilizing these gene modules can significantly improve predictions in drug repurposing by highlighting missed potential targets using single-gene strategies.

Utilizing CRISPR screening for lipid regulation and examining the prioritization of functionally important players within trait-associated modules, we demonstrate the ability of our approach, PhenoPLIER, to contextualize genetic associations. By integrating groups of co-expressed genes into a unified framework, PhenoPLIER offers an innovative way to interpret complex traits and disease etiology. This study underscores the potential for utilizing gene module analyses in uncovering novel therapeutic targets missed by traditional methods in drug repurposing research.</td>

Genes function in tandem with each other within specific contexts to carry out their tasks, which makes understanding how they influence complex traits essential for developing new therapies. Our research aims to achieve this by examining gene expression regulation across diverse conditions.

In addition, we employed a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation analysis, revealing that functional players with no associations still appear in trait-associated modules via PhenoPLIER prioritization. This demonstrates the utility of co-expressed gene groups contextualizing genetic associations and unearths missed therapeutic targets utilizing single-gene strategies.

Genes collaborate with each other to perform their functions within specific contexts. A comprehensive understanding of gene expression across diverse conditions is necessary for identifying how these genes contribute to complex traits. This knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the individual roles of genes in disease mechanisms, recent models predict that gene interactions play a vital role in the origin and progression of diseases. 

In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER - a computational method designed to map gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach leverages modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across corresponding conditions. Our findings reveal that complex traits are significantly associated with disease-relevant gene modules and demonstrate the ability of our model to accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and elucidate mechanisms of action. 

Furthermore, we employed a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation to identify functionally important players in trait-associated modules prioritized by PhenoPLIER.

Context: Complex traits like disease development involve coordinated gene expression and interactions between genes. Recent studies emphasize the importance of understanding such mechanisms for developing new treatments (broader context). Current approaches, however, focus on individual genes rather than complex patterns of gene co-expression in specific contexts. This gap in literature limits our ability to predict drug repurposing and therapeutic targets effectively.

We demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring disease etiology mechanisms.

Conclusion: By mapping gene-trait associations and perturbing drugs to specific cell types, we find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types (result interpretation). Moreover, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and prioritizes functionally important players within trait-associated modules (broader significance) through a CRISPR screen.

Genes work together as a team to perform their functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires exploring expression regulations across different conditions. Recent advances have highlighted the critical importance of this mechanistic insight for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify individual gene roles in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in determining disease origin and progression.

Here we introduce PhenoPLIER – a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, which can highlight how diseases are associated with specific cell types or tissues expressing those disease-associated traits. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers their underlying mechanisms of action.

Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lack associations but remain prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings demonstrate the value of integrating gene co-expression patterns with genetic studies to further our understanding of complex diseases and identify potential therapeutic targets for drug repurposing efforts.">[FAIL] (0.75) Python code returned false

It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.">Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.
