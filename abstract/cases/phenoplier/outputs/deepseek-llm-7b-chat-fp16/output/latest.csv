Additionally, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action by analyzing transcriptome-wide association studies data. We further validate PhenoPLIER's findings using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, finding that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules but lack associations.

In conclusion, we propose an innovative framework to interpret genetic associations and identify potential drug targets through the lens of gene modules by leveraging co-expression patterns. PhenoPLIER significantly contributes to understanding disease etiology, providing novel therapeutic targets, and enabling drug repurposing efforts for complex traits.

This manuscript aims to address a significant gap in our understanding of complex traits and drug mechanisms, which is the crucial role of gene co-expression in determining disease etiology and treatment efficacy. Traditional single-gene approaches often overlook this critical aspect of gene function, leading to suboptimal therapeutic outcomes. By utilizing PhenoPLIER - a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis - we are able to better understand the complex interplay between genes in different contexts and how these interactions influence disease progression and drug efficacy.

Our study reveals that diseases are significantly associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, which is crucial information for identifying novel therapeutic targets. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action by mapping complex trait associations to individual genes within these co-expression clusters. Further, using a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules but lack associations themselves - suggesting that PhenoPLIER's gene module approach is effective at identifying potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.

In conclusion, our work provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene co-expression and highlights its broader significance for drug repurposing efforts. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes into research on complex traits and therapeutics, we can better understand disease etiology and develop targeted treatments with improved efficacy.

We introduce PhenoPLIER - a cutting-edge computational method designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation, enabling joint analysis of complex traits. By considering how genes function collectively rather than individually, our approach emphasizes the importance of understanding their expression regulation across diverse conditions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms; however, modern models suggest that gene interactions play an essential role in the origin and progression of complex diseases.

PhenoPLIER's innovative strategy is based on modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across distinct conditions. We demonstrate significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, supporting our ability to predict known drug-disease pairs accurately and infer disease mechanisms through the analysis of transcriptomic data. Moreover, we utilize a CRISPR screen targeting lipid regulation to identify functionally important players that are prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER.

In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes enables contextually relevant genetic associations, providing novel insights into potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. By utilizing the power of gene module analysis with PhenoPLIER, we offer a revolutionary framework for interpreting genetic associations and uncovering new drug repurposing opportunities in various disease etiologies.

Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions and influence complex traits. However, determining how these genes contribute to disease etiology remains a challenge due to the absence of mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions (e.g., drug repurposing). Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover individual gene roles in disease mechanisms but overlook gene-gene interactions crucial for disease origin and progression.

Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER - a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation suitable for joint analysis of complex traits (e.g., drug repurposing). This approach is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions and enables identification of disease associations with specific cell types. PhenoPLIER successfully predicts known drug-disease pairs, revealing mechanisms of action while uncovering novel therapeutic targets through a CRISPR screen analysis.

Our results highlight that gene co-expression can help identify potential therapeutic targets in complex diseases (e.g., lipid regulation), and the findings contribute to an improved understanding of disease etiology and inform drug repurposing strategies. These advancements not only fill existing gaps within genetic studies but also provide a novel framework for functional genomics, ultimately enabling more precise treatments tailored to individual patient needs.

Genes work together in harmony to perform their functions, which is crucial for understanding complex traits and developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are vital in determining disease etiology and progression. PhenoPLIER, a computational approach we introduce, leverages transcriptomic data to identify associations between complex traits and drugs by mapping them into a common latent representation based on modules with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions.

Our study reveals significant correlations between diseases and gene-module expressions within specific cell types, demonstrating the accuracy of our approach in predicting drug-disease relationships and elucidating mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we find that functionally important molecules lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the potential for repurposing drugs based on gene expression patterns to target complex diseases effectively.

Genetic studies play a vital role in understanding complex traits and their etiology (disease origin). However, current approaches often fail to capture the full complexity of gene interactions involved in these traits due to limited ability to discern co-expression patterns among genes within diverse contexts. Functional genomics has been proposed as a solution, but requires an improved method for identifying key drug targets and repurposing strategies based on gene expression data.

PhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach introduced in this manuscript that maps transcriptome data into latent representations of gene-trait associations, enabling joint analysis with pharmacological perturbation information. By employing modules of genes with similar expression patterns across specific conditions, PhenoPLIER allows for the identification and interpretation of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

We demonstrate the utility of PhenoPLIER through several case studies involving various diseases, where it accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and infers novel mechanisms of action. In a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated gene modules identified by PhenoPLIER despite their lack of direct association with the traits being studied.

Overall, this research addresses an essential gap in understanding complex disease etiology and drug mechanisms by providing improved methods for identifying key genes involved in these processes. It holds significant potential for furthering our knowledge on therapeutic targets and drug repurposing strategies, ultimately contributing to advancements in personalized medicine.

Genes perform their functions through cooperative interactions among themselves within specific contexts. To understand how these genes contribute to complex traits requires a comprehensive understanding of gene expression regulation across diverse conditions. This insight is crucial for developing novel therapies, as demonstrated by transcriptome-wide association studies in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant part in determining disease etiology and progression.

We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach aimed at mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions, this method uncovers disease associations with gene expression patterns in relevant cell types and effectively predicts known drug-disease pairs as well as mechanisms of action.

By using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This suggests the potential for repurposing drugs based on gene co-expression patterns, highlighting an innovative approach towards understanding disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.

The study of complex traits has long been hindered by the need for a mechanistic understanding of gene expression across diverse contexts. Despite advances such as transcriptome-wide association studies, our knowledge remains fragmented and incomplete due to insufficient attention given to gene co-expression patterns. Modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are critical in elucidating disease etiology and progression.

PhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach introduced here, which maps gene-trait associations onto a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By analyzing data from transcriptome-wide association studies and known drug-disease pairs, we demonstrate its accuracy in predicting disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets for drug repurposing.

Furthermore, by leveraging CRISPR screening technology, we reveal that functionally important players in trait regulation are prioritized within modules predicted by PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the potential of this approach to bridge the gap between genetic studies and functional genomics, ultimately illuminating the underlying mechanisms involved in complex traits and guiding therapeutic development.
