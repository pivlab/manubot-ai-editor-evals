To elucidate how these genes influence complex traits, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions is needed. This insight is crucial for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights into the roles of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a key role in disease origin and progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and find that our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.">[PASS] (1.00)  The concerted action of genes in specific contexts is vital for their functional performance.

However, these studies have predominantly focused on single genes, which may not capture the full complexity of gene interactions. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on groups of co-expressed genes, which are known to influence complex traits through concerted action in specific contexts. Using transcriptome-wide association studies, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, it identifies functionally important players lacking direct associations but prioritized within trait-associated gene modules.

 We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. In the context of complex traits, genes act in concert with each other to perform their functions. To understand how these genes influence complex traits, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions is critical. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action.

Using both in silico and experimental approaches, we demonstrated the accuracy of our predictions, highlighting the utility of PhenoPLIER in drug repurposing and uncovering novel therapeutic targets. We further validated our findings using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, which revealed that functionally important players lacking traditional associations were prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.</td>

 Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires an insight into expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is essential for developing new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped to uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

 Complex traits and diseases are influenced by the concerted action of multiple genes in specific contexts. Unraveling how these genes contribute to complex traits requires understanding their expression regulation under different conditions, which is crucial for developing new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed individual gene roles in disease mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a key role in origin and progression of diseases. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach integrating gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we find functionally important players lack associations but prioritize trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.">[FAIL] (0.91) Python code returned false

 Genes function in concert to perform their tasks, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is vital for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have unveiled the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, current models of complex trait architecture indicate that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action.

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
