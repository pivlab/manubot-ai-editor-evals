Understanding how these genes interact to influence disease traits necessitates a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different biological contexts. This insight is crucial for developing new therapies targeting these genetic associations. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Using this framework, we find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack associations but can be prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER integrates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.">[PASS] (1.00)  Diseases are complex phenomena that result from the concerted action of multiple genes and their products.

Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates an appreciation of expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is essential for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped elucidate the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in disease onset and progression. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

 We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires insight into expression regulation across different conditions, which is critical for the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.">[FAIL] (0.89) Python code returned false

 The concerted actions of genes are essential for their functional roles. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates insight into the regulation of expression across different contexts, which is crucial for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, current models predict that gene-gene interactions are pivotal to understanding disease origins and progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across specific conditions. Diseases are significantly associated with relevant gene modules, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action.

 Genes work in harmony with other genes under specific conditions to perform their functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across different contexts, which is crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.">[FAIL] (0.89) Python code returned false
