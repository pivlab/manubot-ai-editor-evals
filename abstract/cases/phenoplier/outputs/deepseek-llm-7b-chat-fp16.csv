Genes work together in harmony to carry out their functions, and understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits requires a deeper insight into gene expression regulation across various conditions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER – a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, we observe significant association between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. 

Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated gene modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations through groups of co-expressed genes, revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework for interpreting genetic associations offers a unique perspective on gene module-based drug repurposing.","[FAIL] (0.82) Python code returned false

Genetic studies aim to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits, while functional genomics seeks to understand gene expression patterns across various conditions. Despite significant advances in transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), a comprehensive understanding of genetic associations remains elusive due to limited mechanistic insights and insufficient coverage of gene interactions.

In the field of genetic studies, understanding how genes collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions is crucial for deciphering complex traits. Current models predict that gene-gene interactions play a central role in disease etiology and progression. However, transcriptome-wide association studies have only begun to uncover individual gene roles, leaving a significant gap in our knowledge of the mechanistic underpinnings of expression regulation across diverse conditions.

We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach designed to bridge the gap between genetic studies and functional genomics. By mapping gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis, we uncover the underlying mechanisms responsible for complex trait development. Recognizing that genes act in concert with each other to perform their functions, our focus is on understanding how these co-expressed genes influence disease etiology and potential therapeutic targets. 

Transcriptome-wide association studies have proven valuable in identifying individual gene roles within disease processes; however, modern models of complex traits predict a significant role for gene-gene interactions in origin and progression. To achieve this mechanistic insight, PhenoPLIER identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across specific conditions, allowing us to observe associations between diseases and these co-expressed genetic elements. Our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action through the identification of functionally important players within trait-associated gene modules.

PhenoPLIER: A Computational Approach for Projecting Genetic Associations and Revealing Therapeutic Mechanisms

Background: To fill the gap in understanding gene-gene interactions, we propose PhenoPLIER - a computational method that maps genetic associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach allows us to study complex traits by considering how genes act in concert with each other under different conditions. 

Method: By analyzing transcriptome-wide association studies, we demonstrate the importance of understanding gene expression regulation in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. PhenoPLIER identifies modules of co-expressed genes across relevant cell types and uses them to predict known drug-disease pairs and infer their therapeutic mechanisms. We further validate our approach using a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation.

Results: Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene expression patterns in specific cell types, validating the utility of our method for identifying potential therapeutic targets. Additionally, we find functional players prioritized in trait-associated modules but lacking associations, suggesting they could be valuable candidates for drug repurposing efforts. 

Conclusion: PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework to contextualize genetic associations and uncover undiscovered therapeutic mechanisms by integrating groups of co-expressed genes.

However, modern research suggests that genetic interactions contribute significantly to disease etiology and progression. Herein, we introduce PhenoPLIER – a novel computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Based on modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns across identical conditions, this method enables the identification of diseases that are strongly associated with specific cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, elucidating mechanisms of action. Furthermore, utilizing CRISPR screening to examine lipid regulation, we discovered functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.","[FAIL] (0.73) Python code returned false

Genes collaborate in concert to execute their functions within specific contexts. Understanding the intricate interplay of gene expression and its regulation is essential for deciphering complex traits and identifying novel therapeutic targets. Though transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms, recent advances in genomics indicate that gene-gene interactions hold crucial importance in determining the origin and progression of diseases.

We introduce PhenoPLIER - a computational approach for mapping associations between genetic traits and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This innovative method leverages modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns across relevant cell types, enabling us to project gene-trait relationships with enhanced accuracy. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with modules expressed in disease-relevant cellular contexts, validating our approach's ability to predict known drug-disease associations and elucidate their underlying mechanisms.

Furthermore, utilizing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we reveal that functionally important players do not exhibit strong association signals but still emerge as prioritized traits-associated modules identified by PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the potential of our method to identify novel therapeutic targets and support drug repurposing strategies in diverse disease contexts.","[PASS] (1.00) Gene expression patterns play a crucial role in determining complex traits, highlighting the importance of understanding gene-gene interactions for disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
