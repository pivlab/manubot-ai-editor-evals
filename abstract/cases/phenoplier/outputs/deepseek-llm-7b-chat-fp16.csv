Genes collaborate with one another in specific contexts to perform their functions, and understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits requires a mechanistic approach to expression regulation across different conditions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped identify the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. 

We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation suitable for joint analysis. This approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our technique accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

We present PhenoPLIER, a cutting-edge computational method that maps genetic trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. Genes function together as gene modules under specific conditions to perform their functions.

Background: The study of genetic associations with complex traits has advanced our understanding of disease etiology and therapeutic mechanisms, yet gaps in knowledge persist. To address these gaps, we developed a novel method called PhenoPLIER that projects gene expression patterns to highlight functional relationships between genes within co-expressed modules. By doing so, this approach fills the existing gap by providing mechanistic insights into genetic associations and drug repurposing, ultimately enhancing our ability to predict and understand complex traits.

Recent advances have shown that a mechanistic understanding of transcriptome dynamics is crucial for developing novel therapies (e.g., repurposing drugs). Despite these breakthroughs, there is still a gap in our knowledge regarding gene-gene interactions and disease etiology.

In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER - a computational framework that integrates phenotypic traits with pharmacological perturbation data to map them into common latent representations for joint analysis. By leveraging gene modules with similar expression patterns across relevant cell types, we identified significant associations between diseases and these modules while validating our approach by accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action.

Moreover, using a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated gene modules as predicted by PhenoPLIER. These findings underscore the importance of integrating multi-dimensional data for understanding complex traits, validating known drug targets while identifying novel therapeutic opportunities, and ultimately advancing personalized medicine.","genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits","Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Genes function in concert with one another to perform their functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic examination of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is crucial for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play an essential part in disease origin and progression.

In the context of functional genomics and gene co-expression, this manuscript aims to address a critical gap in our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms by proposing an innovative computational approach called PhenoPLIER. By utilizing transcriptome-wide association studies, we have discovered that individual genes play crucial roles in complex traits; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin and progression.

Here, we introduce a new computational method that maps gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis of gene modules exhibiting similar expression patterns across various conditions (i.e., cell types). Our approach efficiently identifies relationships between diseases and the genes they are associated with in relevant cellular contexts while also accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs, elucidating mechanisms of action.

Through the application of PhenoPLIER on a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players do not show associations but still play crucial roles within trait-associated modules. Our findings highlight the potential for new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities by providing insights into disease etiology and pharmacological intervention mechanisms. In conclusion, this study contributes to our understanding of complex traits and advances the field through identification of novel therapeutic options based on gene co-expression patterns.","genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits","Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.
