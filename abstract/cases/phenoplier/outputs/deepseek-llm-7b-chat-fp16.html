Genes collaborate with each other to perform their functions in specific contexts. To understand how these genes influence complex traits, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions is essential for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have identified the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

PhenoPLIER is a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, highlighting their importance in understanding diseases' etiology and drug mechanisms. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and find our approach to be accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for analyzing lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, integrating groups of co-expressed genes through the lens of gene modules provides context to genetic associations, enabling the discovery and validation of potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and exploring disease etiology, providing valuable insights into drug repurposing and mechanisms of action.">[FAIL] (0.88) Python code returned false

This manuscript aims to bridge the gap between genetic studies and functional genomics by utilizing gene co-expression patterns to elucidate disease etiology, drug mechanisms, and therapeutic targets. To achieve this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, thereby capturing gene-gene interactions in complex traits.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER by accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, contextualizing these relationships and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. By integrating groups of co-expressed genes, this approach sheds light on complex traits and has broad implications in drug repurposing efforts.">[FAIL] (0.88) Python code returned false

We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. By understanding the concerted actions of genes in specific contexts to perform their functions, we can better determine how these genes influence complex traits and subsequently develop new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed valuable insights regarding individual genes' role in disease mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial part in the origin and progression of complex diseases.

PhenoPLIER utilizes modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across relevant conditions to project genetic associations and uncover potential therapeutic targets. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with these module-level expressions, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs, and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, we find that functionally important players within trait-associated gene modules are prioritized by PhenoPLIER but lack direct associations.

In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes enables the contextualization of genetic associations through phenotypic modules, providing a novel framework for interpreting complex traits and missed targets in single-gene strategies. By using PhenoPLIER, we can better understand disease etiology and elucidate potential drug mechanisms to facilitate therapeutic repurposing efforts.">[FAIL] (0.63) Python code returned false

Genes collaborate in unison to perform their functions under specific conditions, which necessitates a mechanistic understanding of gene expression across different contexts for complex trait determination. Recent studies have demonstrated that this insight is crucial for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have contributed significantly to uncovering the role of individual genes within disease-relevant mechanisms; however, contemporary models of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal part in disease origin and progression.

In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER - a computational approach designed for mapping gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation suitable for joint analysis. The underlying structure is based on modules comprising genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases exhibit significant association with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we utilize a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, revealing functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.">[FAIL] (0.75) Python code returned false

In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, understanding how gene expression patterns contribute to complex traits remains a critical gap in our knowledge. This is particularly relevant for drug repurposing efforts, as identifying molecular mechanisms underlying disease etiology can significantly impact therapeutic targets. The current literature primarily focuses on individual gene associations with specific conditions while neglecting the intricate interplay among genes and their co-expression patterns.

To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across relevant conditions, providing insights into the underlying mechanisms driving disease etiology. By applying PhenoPLIER to existing datasets, we demonstrate its accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs, revealing novel molecular targets and elucidating therapeutic mechanisms.

Furthermore, our study reveals that functionally important players identified through a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation are prioritized by phenotypic traits associated with disease but lack associations themselves. These findings highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER to identify novel drug candidates and illuminate previously unexplored aspects of complex trait etiology. In conclusion, this work advances our understanding of gene-gene interactions and their impact on complex diseases while offering promising avenues for drug repurposing strategies.">[FAIL] (0.75) Python code returned false

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
