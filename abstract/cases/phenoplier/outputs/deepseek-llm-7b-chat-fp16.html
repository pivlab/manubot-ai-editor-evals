However, recent advances in functional genomics and transcriptome-wide association studies suggest that gene co-expression plays a crucial role in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. To gain insight into these interactions, we introduce PhenoPLIER - a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This method leverages modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions to project genetic associations and predict potential therapeutic targets.

Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we utilize a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, revealing functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-associated modules. In conclusion, our approach contextualizes genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, potentially uncovering novel therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies.">[PASS] (1.00) Genetic studies have traditionally focused on the role of individual genes in complex traits.

We present PhenoPLIER, a computational tool designed to integrate gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By recognizing that genes collaborate together in specific contexts to perform their functions, we emphasize the importance of understanding expression regulation across diverse conditions when determining complex trait influence. This insight is crucial for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms; however, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease etiology and progression.

PhenoPLIER constructs modules of genes with shared expression patterns across relevant conditions, revealing significant associations between diseases and specific cell type-specific gene modules. The method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action for therapeutic targets. Moreover, utilizing a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER despite lacking direct associations. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential drug repurposing opportunities missed through single-gene strategies.

To address this critical need, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates transcriptomic data and pharmacological perturbation information into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our work highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms by mapping gene-trait associations and identifying relevant cell types associated with diseases. Moreover, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and uncovers functional players prioritized in trait-associated modules. Finally, we validate PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation and demonstrate its potential for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing. Overall, these findings not only expand our knowledge of complex traits but also provide valuable insights into the development of new therapies.</td>
