          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes collaborate in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits
          necessitates elucidating the regulation of gene expression across
          different conditions. This insight is crucial for the development of
          novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in
          uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms.
          However, contemporary models of the architecture of complex traits
          suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease
          onset and progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed
          genes across the same conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a
          CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups
          of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations
          and identifies potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene
          strategies.

          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed

          In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact with each
          other in specific contexts is crucial for uncovering the mechanisms

          transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights

          repurposing efforts.

          In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes interact
          with one another in specific contexts to perform their functions, and
          understanding these interactions is crucial for developing new
          therapies. However, current transcriptome-wide association studies
          primarily focus on individual genes and their roles in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, while modern models predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and
          progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
          results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find
          that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies, thereby moving the broader field forward.


          In summary, we have developed PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis, based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns
          across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
          infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions;
          understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a
          comprehensive grasp of expression regulation across diverse
          conditions. This knowledge is essential for the development of novel
          therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the
          role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However,
          contemporary models of the architecture of complex traits propose that
          gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and
          progression. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is grounded in modules of genes with comparable
          expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action.
          Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          discover that functionally significant players lack associations but
          are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes
          genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that may be
          overlooked by single-gene strategies.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          with each other in specific contexts is crucial for uncovering the
          mechanisms behind complex traits and developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual
          gene roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          In the complex interplay of genes, they function in concert within
          specific contexts to perform their roles. Understanding how these
          genes influence intricate traits necessitates elucidating expression
          regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is crucial for
          the development of novel therapeutics. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have aided in uncovering the role of individual genes in
          disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in
          determining disease onset and progression. We present PhenoPLIER, a
          computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on groups of genes
          exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
          approach demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and it accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action.
          Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find
          that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER contextualizes
          genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that might be
          overlooked by single-gene strategies.


          In the revised paragraph, we have made several improvements to enhance
          clarity and accuracy:

          1. Replaced "determining" with "elucidating" in the sentence about
          understanding gene influence on complex traits.

          2. Changed "specifico contexts" to "specific contexts."

          3. Replaced "DNA" with "genes" in the sentence about CRISPR screen
          analysis of lipid regulation.

          4. Added commas and periods to improve sentence structure and
          readability.

          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions, and
          understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates an
          insight into expression regulation across various conditions. This
          knowledge is vital for the development of novel therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped elucidate the role
          of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However,
          contemporary models of the architecture of complex traits suggest that
          gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease onset and
          progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies, thereby highlighting disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms.


          In the revised paragraph, I have made several improvements to enhance
          clarity and readability:


          1. Replaced "in specifico contexts" with "in specific contexts".

          2. Changed "across different conditions" to "across various
          conditions".

          3. Replaced "disease-relevant mechanisms" with "disease-related
          mechanisms".

          4. Removed the comma after "diseases are significantl associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types," and replaced
          "significantl" with "significantly".

          5. Changed "this knowledge is critical for developing new therapies"
          to "This knowledge is vital for the development of novel therapies".

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          In the realm of functional genomics, understanding gene interactions
          in specific contexts is crucial for elucidating their roles in complex
          traits and developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in
          disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions

          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions,
          necessitating a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across various conditions for elucidating the influence of genes on
          complex traits. This knowledge is crucial for the development of novel
          therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed to
          uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the architecture of
          complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role
          in disease onset and progression. We present PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
          findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms
          of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. PhenoPLIER's ability to incorporate groups of co-expressed
          genes enables the contextualization of genetic associations and
          uncovers potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches.


          In this revised abstract, we have improved grammar, clarity, and
          consistency in terminology while maintaining the core message of the
          original paragraph.

          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other
          in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a shared latent representation for comprehensive analysis.
          This representation is derived from modules of co-expressed genes
          across similar conditions. We find that diseases are significantly
          linked to relevant gene expression modules, and our method effectively
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action.
          Employing CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we discover that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By considering
          co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic
          associations and identifies potential targets overlooked by
          single-gene approaches. Genes collaborate in specific contexts to
          carry out their functions; understanding how these genes influence
          complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression
          regulation under various conditions. This insight is essential for the
          development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have contributed to uncovering individual gene roles in
          disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex
          trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in
          determining disease onset and progression.

          In recent years, genetic studies have focused on understanding the
          roles of single genes in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
          However, the current literature lacks a comprehensive approach to
          analyze gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          simultaneously. This manuscript aims to fill this gap by introducing
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that maps these two types of
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. The
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions, allowing for accurate predictions
          of known drug-disease pairs and inference of drug mechanisms.
          Moreover, PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important players
          that lack associations but are present in trait-associated modules. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, this approach provides a
          more mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions, which is essential for developing new therapies.
          This study demonstrates the potential of PhenoPLIER in contextualizing
          genetic associations and revealing potential targets that may be
          missed by single-gene strategies.


          In conclusion, the development of PhenoPLIER offers a significant
          advancement in the field of functional genomics by providing a novel
          computational approach to analyze gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data simultaneously. This method not only
          improves our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms but
          also helps identify potential therapeutic targets that may be missed
          by single-gene strategies. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER offers a more comprehensive approach to studying
          complex traits, which is crucial for the development of new therapies.

          The field of genomics has long sought to understand the role of
          gene-gene interactions in the development and progression of diseases.
          Despite the advancements made by transcriptome-wide association
          studies, these approaches have primarily focused on single genes,
          potentially overlooking critical gene-gene interactions. This gap in
          the current literature underscores the need for a computational method
          that can effectively map gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that
          leverages modules of co-expressed genes to bridge this gap. Through
          our research, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and elucidates the mechanisms of action for these
          associations. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking direct
          associations are prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated
          modules. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. This computational method not only
          advances our understanding of gene-gene interactions but also has the
          potential to inform the development of new therapies for complex
          diseases.


          In this study, we address a significant gap in the current literature
          by developing PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is based
          on modules of co-expressed genes, which allows us to accurately
          predict known drug-disease pairs and elucidate the mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes
          functionally important players lacking direct associations in
          trait-associated modules. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, our approach contextualizes genetic associations and reveals
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This research not
          only contributes to the field's understanding of gene-gene
          interactions but also has the potential to inform the development of
          new therapies for complex diseases.

          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a computational framework that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          shared latent space for joint analysis. This approach is based on
          modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions, highlighting
          the significance of disease association with gene expression in
          relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of
          action. In a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important genes lacking associations are prioritized
          within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating
          co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER provides context for genetic
          associations and identifies potential targets that may be overlooked
          in single-gene approaches. Genes collaborate to execute their
          functions in specific contexts, necessitating a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across various conditions. This
          insight is essential for the development of innovative therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of
          individual genes in disease-related mechanisms; however, contemporary
          models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
          interactions play a pivotal role in disease initiation and
          progression.

          The current literature on genetic studies and functional genomics
          predominantly focuses on single-gene strategies to understand the
          etiology of diseases and their response to pharmaceutical
          interventions. However, this approach has limitations as it fails to
          capture the complex interactions between genes that are crucial in
          disease progression. Our manuscript aims to fill this gap by
          introducing PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach is
          based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
          same conditions, which allows us to identify diseases significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
          our method using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, where we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. In conclusion, our manuscript contributes
          to the broader field of gene co-expression analysis by providing a new
          computational tool that can enhance our understanding of complex
          traits, disease etiology, and drug mechanisms. This will ultimately
          help in the development of more effective therapeutic targets and
          facilitate drug repurposing efforts.

          The field of complex trait analysis has long sought to understand the
          interplay between genes and their influence on disease mechanisms.
          Current state-of-the-art methods primarily focus on single-gene

          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent representation for comprehensive analysis.
          This approach is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar
          expression patterns under the same conditions. We demonstrate that
          diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our method effectively predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and elucidates their mechanisms of action.
          Utilizing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discover that
          functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized
          within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups
          of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations
          and reveals potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene
          approaches. Genes collaborate with one another in specific
          circumstances to carry out their functions. Understanding how these
          genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic
          comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. This
          knowledge is essential for the development of novel therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in
          elucidating the role of individual genes in disease-related
          mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the architecture of
          complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role
          in disease onset and progression.

          In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, researchers
          have long been seeking ways to better understand the connections
          between gene expression patterns, disease etiology, and drug
          mechanisms. Existing methods often focus on single-gene strategies,
          which may not capture the complex interplay of genes that influence
          disease progression. To address this gap in the literature, we

          In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding the
          complex interplay between genes and their roles in disease mechanisms.
          While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          individual gene contributions to disease, it is becoming increasingly
          clear that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
          origin and progression. This has left a significant gap in our
          knowledge regarding how genes act in concert with each other across
          different conditions to perform their functions, particularly when it

          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach
          that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation for

          CRISPR screen analysis on lipid regulation reveals that functionally
          important players may lack direct associations but are prioritized

          overlooked by single-gene strategies. Genes often collaborate in
          specific contexts to execute their functions, necessitating a
          mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across diverse
          conditions. This understanding is essential for the development of
          innovative therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies
          have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-related
          mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease initiation and
          progression.

          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting

          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these

          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern

          In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding the
          genetic basis of complex diseases and identifying potential
          therapeutic targets. However, current research has primarily focused
          on single-gene strategies, which may not capture the full complexity
          of gene-gene interactions that contribute to disease development. To
          address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach that combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This approach is based on modules of genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to
          identify diseases associated with specific gene modules in relevant
          cell types. We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, as well as
          prioritizes functionally important players that lack associations but
          are present in trait-associated modules. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our
          results highlight the importance of understanding gene expression
          regulation across different conditions to uncover the mechanisms
          underlying complex traits and inform the development of new therapies.

          In the field of computational biology, there is a growing need to
          understand the complex interplay between genes, traits, and
          pharmacological perturbations. Existing research has focused on
          mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data,
          but these approaches have not adequately addressed the specific gap in
          understanding how gene modules expressed in relevant cell types are
          associated with diseases. This gap is significant because it limits
          our ability to predict known drug-disease pairs, infer mechanisms of
          action, and prioritize functionally important players in
          trait-associated modules. To address this gap, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions, which allows us to observe significant associations
          between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          PhenoPLIER's accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action demonstrates its potential value in the
          broader field of computational biology. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This
          approach contributes to a mechanistic understanding of expression
          regulation across different conditions, which is critical for
          developing new therapies targeting complex traits.


          In conclusion, our study fills the gap in the literature by
          introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          This method highlights functionally important players in
          trait-associated modules, providing valuable insights into gene-gene
          interactions and their role in disease origin and progression. By
          contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies, PhenoPLIER contributes to a deeper
          understanding of the complex interplay between genes, traits, and
          pharmacological perturbations, ultimately moving the broader field of
          computational biology forward.

          In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on groups of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and elucidates mechanisms of action. Utilizing a CRISPR screen to

          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER
          contextualizes genetic associations and identifies potential targets
          that may be missed by single-gene approaches. Genes collaborate with
          one another in specific contexts to carry out their functions. Gaining
          a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various
          conditions is essential for elucidating how these genes influence
          complex traits, which is crucial for the development of novel
          therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped reveal

          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in

          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          The current literature on genetic studies has primarily focused on
          single-gene strategies to understand the etiology of diseases and
          their associated drug mechanisms. However, this approach has
          overlooked the importance of gene co-expression and functional
          genomics in elucidating the complex interplay between genes that
          contribute to disease progression. This study aims to address this gap
          by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. By analyzing modules of
          genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, we
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate
          in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of

          we find that functionally important players lack associations but are

          incorporation of groups of co-expressed genes enables PhenoPLIER to
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. By providing a comprehensive understanding
          of gene expression regulation across different conditions, this study
          offers valuable insights into the development of new therapies for
          complex traits and diseases, moving the broader field forward in terms
          of drug repurposing and therapeutic target identification.

          In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding the
          role of gene-gene interactions in the development and progression of
          complex diseases. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the individual genes involved in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, these approaches often overlook the importance of
          gene-gene interactions. This study aims to fill this gap by
          introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. The method is based on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions, which are found to be significantly associated with
          diseases in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates accuracy in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals
          that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. This novel approach provides a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions,
          which is critical for developing new therapies targeting complex
          traits.


          In conclusion, the development of PhenoPLIER not only fills the gap in
          the current literature regarding gene-gene interactions but also
          offers promising insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying
          complex diseases. By providing a comprehensive view of gene
          associations and their functional relevance, this computational
          approach has the potential to advance our understanding of disease
          pathways and inform the development of targeted therapies.

          across different conditions for elucidating the influence of genes on
          complex traits. This insight is crucial for developing new therapeutic
          approaches. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the
          role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however,
          modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are essential to
          understanding disease etiology and progression. Our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action by associating diseases with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is based on groups of co-expressed genes sharing similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating these gene
          modules, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies,
          thereby highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          Genetic studies have long been at the forefront of understanding
          complex traits and their underlying mechanisms; however, the current
          state-of-the-art approaches often fail to account for gene-gene
          interactions, which are crucial in disease origin and progression.
          This gap in literature motivated the development of a novel
          computational approach called PhenoPLIER, which aims to address this
          limitation by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. The core of PhenoPLIER lies in the identification of modules
          of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions,
          thereby facilitating the contextualization of genetic associations and
          the discovery of potential targets that may have been overlooked by
          single-gene strategies. In our study, we demonstrate the accuracy of
          PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action, as well as its ability to identify functionally
          important players that lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules. The use of a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation further supports the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER in
          uncovering gene co-expression patterns and their role in disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms. Overall, our results highlight the
          potential of PhenoPLIER as a valuable tool for functional genomics
          research, offering new insights into the complex interplay between
          genes, traits, and diseases, and paving the way for more effective
          therapeutic targets and drug repurposing strategies.

          In the field of gene regulation, understanding how specific genes
          collaborate to influence complex traits is essential for developing
          new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          provided insights into individual gene roles in disease mechanisms,
          modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant

          In this study, we investigate the concerted actions of genes in
          specific contexts to elucidate their roles in complex traits. To
          achieve this, we focus on understanding the regulation of gene
          expression across different conditions, as this knowledge is essential
          for developing novel therapeutic approaches. We employ
          transcriptome-wide association studies to uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-related mechanisms and explore the
          significance of gene-gene interactions in disease initiation and
          progression. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action.


          To further enhance our understanding, we utilize a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach

          genetic associations and identification of potential targets that may
          be missed by single-gene strategies.


          In summary, our study highlights the importance of gene expression
          patterns and functional genomics in understanding disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms. By leveraging PhenoPLIER's ability to analyze gene
          co-expression, we aim to uncover previously overlooked therapeutic
          targets and facilitate drug repurposing efforts, ultimately
          contributing to the development of more effective treatments for
          complex diseases.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is

          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
          collaborate to influence complex traits requires an in-depth
          examination of expression regulation across various conditions. This
          knowledge is essential for developing new therapeutic approaches.
          While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the
          role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in both disease
          etiology and progression. Our study reveals a strong association
          between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types,
          and our approach demonstrates accuracy in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. We also
          utilize a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that
          functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized
          within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Here, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
          representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
          groups of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating these co-expressed gene modules,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and unveil potential
          therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies,
          thereby highlighting the broader significance of our findings in the
          field of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in

          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact

          Genes collaborate to carry out their functions in specific situations,
          necessitating a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions for elucidating the influence of genes on
          complex traits. This insight is crucial for developing novel
          therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped unveil
          the roles of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However,
          contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease initiation and
          progression. We find that diseases are significantly linked to gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action.
          Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discover
          that functionally significant players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In this study,
          we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on groups of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. By incorporating co-expressed gene clusters, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          that may be missed by single-gene approaches.


          In the revised abstract, we have emphasized the significance of
          gene-gene interactions in disease initiation and progression,
          introduced PhenoPLIER as a computational approach for mapping
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data, and
          highlighted the potential of PhenoPLIER to reveal missed targets by
          single-gene strategies.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genetic studies have long been a crucial aspect of understanding
          complex traits and diseases; however, the current state-of-the-art
          approaches often focus on individual genes rather than their
          interactions. This limitation has left a significant gap in our
          ability to comprehend disease etiology and drug mechanisms fully. To
          address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. Our method is based on modules of co-expressed genes across
          the same conditions, allowing us to contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.


          In this study, we demonstrate that our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, our method not only provides a more comprehensive
          understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms but also offers
          new insights into therapeutic targets and the potential for drug
          repurposing.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic
          associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies has significant broader implications for functional
          genomics research. By integrating gene co-expression data with
          pharmacological perturbation information, our approach offers a
          powerful tool for identifying novel therapeutic targets and deepening
          our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          In the field of genomics, understanding how genes work together in
          specific contexts is crucial for uncovering the mechanisms behind
          complex traits and developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have provided valuable insights into the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest
          that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin
          and progression. The current literature, however, lacks a
          comprehensive computational approach to map gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. This gap in knowledge is
          particularly relevant given the increasing importance of understanding
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types for disease association
          studies. 


          To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint

          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Our approach has been validated through
          accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs and inferences of
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. 


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a significant advancement in the
          field of genomics by providing a comprehensive computational approach
          to analyze gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data. This approach not only fills an important gap in the current
          literature but also has broader significance as it can help in
          uncovering the mechanisms behind complex traits, informing new
          therapeutic strategies, and improving our understanding of disease
          origins and progression.

          Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts,
          necessitating a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation
          across various conditions for elucidating the influence of genes on
          complex traits. This knowledge is crucial for advancing novel
          therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
          instrumental in uncovering individual gene roles in disease
          mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture
          suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in determining disease
          onset and progression. We observe a strong correlation between
          diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is successful in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          elucidating mechanisms of action. Employing a CRISPR screen to study
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally significant players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on groups of co-expressed genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating
          co-expression networks, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
          associations and reveal potential targets that may be overlooked by
          single-gene approaches.


          In this revised paragraph, we have emphasized the importance of
          understanding gene interactions in disease progression and introduced
          PhenoPLIER as a computational method to map gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified representation
          for joint analysis. This approach incorporates co-expression networks
          to contextualize genetic associations and identify potential targets
          that may be missed by single-gene strategies, thereby highlighting the
          significance of functional genomics in disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms.

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genetic studies have long been crucial in understanding complex traits
          and their associations with diseases; however, the current
          state-of-the-art approaches primarily focus on individual genes,
          overlooking the potential role of gene-gene interactions in disease
          origin and progression. In this context, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          novel computational approach that aims to fill this gap by mapping
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach is
          based on modules of co-expressed genes, which allows for the
          simultaneous analysis of multiple genetic associations. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. In our study, we demonstrate that
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action, highlighting its utility in the field of
          functional genomics and therapeutic target identification.


          In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to analyze gene-trait associations
          through co-expression modules offers a significant advancement in the
          understanding of complex traits and their association with diseases.
          This approach not only improves our knowledge of disease etiology but
          also aids in the discovery of new therapeutic targets and drug
          mechanisms. By moving beyond single-gene analysis, PhenoPLIER has
          broader significance for the field of functional genomics, as it
          enables researchers to explore gene-gene interactions and their role
          in disease progression more effectively.


          In summary, our study presents a novel computational approach,
          PhenoPLIER, which maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis based on modules of co-expressed genes. This method offers
          significant advancements in the understanding of complex traits and
          their association with diseases by incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, thereby revealing potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. The accurate prediction of known drug-disease
          pairs and inference of mechanisms of action demonstrated by PhenoPLIER
          highlight its utility in the field of functional genomics and
          therapeutic target identification.

          In the field of genetics, understanding how genes collaborate in
          specific contexts is crucial for unraveling their functions and
          developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies
          have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms,
          modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in
          disease origin and progression. Currently, there exists a gap in the
          literature regarding computational approaches that can accurately
          predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action while
          also incorporating gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. In
          this paper, we address this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a novel

          contributes to the development of more effective therapeutic
          approaches for complex diseases.

          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact
          with each other is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms behind
          complex traits and developing new therapies. However, current methods
          primarily focus on individual gene associations, which may overlook
          important gene-gene interactions that contribute to disease origin and
          progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed
          genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions. By
          incorporating these gene groups, PhenoPLIER provides a more
          comprehensive understanding of genetic associations, revealing
          potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. Our
          approach demonstrates significant associations between diseases and
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lacking associations are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This work not
          only advances the understanding of gene co-expression in disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms but also highlights the potential of
          PhenoPLIER for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing,
          ultimately contributing to the broader field of genetic studies and
          functional genomics.

          Genes collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions, and
          understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates
          elucidating expression regulation across diverse conditions. This
          knowledge is vital for the development of novel therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in uncovering the
          role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However,
          contemporary models of the architecture of complex traits propose that
          gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and
          progression. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is grounded in modules of genes with analogous expression patterns
          across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and identify
          potential targets that might be missed by single-gene methodologies.
          We find that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action.
          Moreover, utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          discover that functionally significant players lack associations but
          are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in

          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          Genetic studies have been conducted extensively to understand the role
          of individual genes in disease mechanisms; however, the modern models
          of complex traits' architecture predict that gene-gene interactions
          play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. In this
          context, there exists a gap in the current literature regarding the
          integration of gene expression patterns for a comprehensive analysis
          of genetic associations and their potential therapeutic targets. To
          address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions, allowing us to incorporate groups
          of co-expressed genes and contextualize genetic associations. Our
          results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms
          of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, our approach not only fills the gap in
          current literature but also contributes to the broader field of
          functional genomics and drug mechanisms by providing a novel method
          for analyzing gene co-expression and identifying potential therapeutic
          targets that were previously missed by single-gene strategies.

          In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact with each

          In concert with one another, genes play a crucial role in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Understanding how these genes
          influence complex traits necessitates an understanding of expression
          regulation across various conditions. This insight is vital for the
          development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have been successful in unveiling the role of individual genes in
          disease-related mechanisms. However, current models predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease onset and
          progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is built upon modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and identify potential targets that may be missed by single-gene
          strategies. We find that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.


          In this study, we developed PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes with similar
          expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
          associations and reveal potential targets that may be missed by
          single-gene strategies. We observed significant associations between
          diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, as well as
          accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs and inferred
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid
          regulation revealed that functionally important players lacked
          associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.


          In summary, our study introduced PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate the accuracy of
          PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action, as well as its ability to identify functionally
          important players that lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules. Overall, this study highlights the potential
          of PhenoPLIER as a valuable tool for understanding gene-gene
          interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately
          contributing to the development of new therapies and therapeutic
          targets.

          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          In the field of genomics, understanding the interplay between genes
          and their influence on complex traits is crucial for developing new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, modern models
          suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease
          origin and progression. Here, we address this gap by introducing
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
          modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions, which allows
          PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen
          to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
          players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. This work highlights the importance of
          considering gene co-expression in understanding disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms, moving the broader field forward in its quest for
          more effective therapeutic targets and repurposing strategies.

          Genes often work together in specific contexts to carry out their
          functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits
          necessitates a comprehensive grasp of expression regulation across
          various conditions. This insight is crucial for the development of new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
          elucidate the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms,
          modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene
          interactions play a pivotal role in disease initiation and
          progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on groups of co-expressed genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By
          incorporating these gene modules, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
          associations and reveal potential targets that may be missed by

          offers a promising avenue for elucidating gene-gene interactions and
          their roles in disease initiation and progression, ultimately
          contributing to the development of more effective therapies.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, understanding
          how genes interact with each other to influence complex traits is

          association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
          in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene

          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. This research fills the gap in current literature by
          demonstrating how incorporating co-expressed genes can improve the
          identification of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately
          moving the broader field forward.

          Genes collaborate in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits
          necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
          across varying conditions. This insight is vital for the development
          of innovative therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped elucidate the role of individual genes in disease-related
          mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the architecture of
          complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial in
          determining the origin and progression of diseases. We present
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
          derived from modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and identify potential targets that may be missed by single-gene
          strategies. We find that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating
          mechanisms of action. Moreover, utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.


          In this revised abstract, the text has been improved for clarity and
          readability while retaining the original information. The focus on the
          importance of gene-gene interactions, the role of co-expressed genes
          in contextualizing genetic associations, and the accuracy of
          PhenoPLIER in predicting drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms
          of action have been emphasized.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is

          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes work
          together in specific contexts to influence complex traits is essential
          for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene
          interactions are crucial for disease origin and progression. The
          current literature, however, lacks a comprehensive approach to
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. To address this gap, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
          modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes to provide a
          more accurate understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
          Our results show that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, and prioritizes
          functionally important players in trait-associated modules. By filling
          this gap in the literature, PhenoPLIER has the potential to advance
          our understanding of disease etiology and inform the development of
          new therapeutic targets.

          The field of genomics has long been focused on understanding the role
          of individual genes in complex traits and diseases. However, recent
          models suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial for disease
          origin and progression. Here, we address this gap by introducing
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations

          conditions, allowing for contextualization of genetic associations and
          potential target identification beyond single-gene strategies. We
          demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and mechanisms of action while prioritizing functionally
          important players in trait-associated modules. This approach not only
          contributes to the understanding of gene-gene interactions but also
          has broader significance for the development of new therapies
          targeting complex traits and diseases.

              Genes collaborate in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex
              traits necessitates elucidating the regulation of gene expression
              across different conditions. This insight is crucial for the
              development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have aided in uncovering the role of individual genes in
              disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the
              architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions
              play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression. We introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions.
              Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations
              and identifies potential targets that may be overlooked by
              single-gene strategies.

              In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes
              interact with one another in specific contexts to perform their
              functions, and understanding these interactions is crucial for
              developing new therapies. However, current transcriptome-wide
              association studies primarily focus on individual genes and their
              roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, while modern models predict
              that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease
              origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions. Our results show that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies, thereby moving the broader field forward.


              In summary, we have developed PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis, based on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets

            Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to
            perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
            complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
            regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this
            insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
            the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
            to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
            genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
            potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

              Genes collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions;
              understanding how these genes influence complex traits
              necessitates a comprehensive grasp of expression regulation across
              diverse conditions. This knowledge is essential for the
              development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have elucidated the role of individual genes in
              disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the
              architecture of complex traits propose that gene-gene interactions
              play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression. We present
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              grounded in modules of genes with comparable expression patterns
              across the same conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases
              are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation,
              we discover that functionally significant players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers
              potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene
              strategies.

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              interact with each other in specific contexts is crucial for

              In the complex interplay of genes, they function in concert within
              specific contexts to perform their roles. Understanding how these
              genes influence intricate traits necessitates elucidating
              expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is
              crucial for the development of novel therapeutics.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in uncovering
              the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms.
              However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture predict
              that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in determining disease
              onset and progression. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational
              method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on groups of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              Our approach demonstrates that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              it accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
              lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. By incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER
              contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets
              that might be overlooked by single-gene strategies.


              In the revised paragraph, we have made several improvements to
              enhance clarity and accuracy:

              1. Replaced "determining" with "elucidating" in the sentence about
              understanding gene influence on complex traits.

              2. Changed "specifico contexts" to "specific contexts."

              3. Replaced "DNA" with "genes" in the sentence about CRISPR screen
              analysis of lipid regulation.

              4. Added commas and periods to improve sentence structure and
              readability.

              In the realm of functional genomics, understanding gene
              interactions in specific contexts is crucial for elucidating their
              roles in complex traits and developing new therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest
              that gene-gene interactions are vital to disease origin and
              progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is derived from modules of genes
              with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our
              results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of
              action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, thereby
              filling a gap in the current literature on gene-disease
              relationships and therapeutic development.

              Genes collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions,
              necessitating a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across various conditions for elucidating the influence of genes
              on complex traits. This knowledge is crucial for the development
              of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
              contributed to uncovering the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the
              architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions
              play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression. We present

              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a

              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
              PhenoPLIER's ability to incorporate groups of co-expressed genes
              enables the contextualization of genetic associations and uncovers
              potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches.

              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across various conditions. Our results
              show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation,
              we find that functionally important players lack associations but
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies, ultimately contributing to the
              development of new therapeutics and a deeper understanding of
              disease mechanisms.

              In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent representation for
              comprehensive analysis. This representation is derived from
              modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions. We find
              that diseases are significantly linked to relevant gene expression
              modules, and our method effectively predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Employing CRISPR
              screening for lipid regulation, we discover that functionally
              important players lack associations but are prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By considering
              co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic
              associations and identifies potential targets overlooked by

              In recent years, genetic studies have focused on understanding the
              roles of single genes in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
              However, the current literature lacks a comprehensive approach to
              analyze gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data simultaneously. This manuscript aims to fill this gap by
              introducing PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that maps
              these two types of data into a common latent representation for
              joint analysis. The representation is based on modules of genes
              with similar expression patterns across the same conditions,
              allowing for accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs and
              inference of drug mechanisms. Moreover, PhenoPLIER can prioritize
              functionally important players that lack associations but are
              present in trait-associated modules. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, this approach provides a more mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different
              conditions, which is essential for developing new therapies. This
              study demonstrates the potential of PhenoPLIER in contextualizing
              genetic associations and revealing potential targets that may be
              missed by single-gene strategies.


              In conclusion, the development of PhenoPLIER offers a significant
              advancement in the field of functional genomics by providing a
              novel computational approach to analyze gene-trait associations
              and pharmacological perturbation data simultaneously. This method
              not only improves our understanding of disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms but also helps identify potential therapeutic targets
              that may be missed by single-gene strategies. By incorporating
              groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers a more
              comprehensive approach to studying complex traits, which is
              crucial for the development of new therapies.

              The field of genomics has long sought to understand the role of
              gene-gene interactions in the development and progression of
              diseases. Despite the advancements made by transcriptome-wide
              association studies, these approaches have primarily focused on
              single genes, potentially overlooking critical gene-gene
              interactions. This gap in the current literature underscores the
              need for a computational method that can effectively map
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. Here, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that leverages modules of
              co-expressed genes to bridge this gap. Through our research, we
              demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and elucidates the mechanisms of action for these
              associations. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
              direct associations are prioritized by PhenoPLIER in
              trait-associated modules. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This
              computational method not only advances our understanding of
              gene-gene interactions but also has the potential to inform the
              development of new therapies for complex diseases.


              In this study, we address a significant gap in the current
              literature by developing PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. Our method is based on modules of co-expressed genes,
              which allows us to accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and
              elucidate the mechanisms of action. Additionally, we demonstrate
              that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players lacking
              direct associations in trait-associated modules. By incorporating
              groups of co-expressed genes, our approach contextualizes genetic
              associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. This research not only contributes to the field's
              understanding of gene-gene interactions but also has the potential
              to inform the development of new therapies for complex diseases.

              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              We present PhenoPLIER, a computational framework that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a shared latent space for joint analysis. This approach is based
              on modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions,
              highlighting the significance of disease association with gene
              expression in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates high
              accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating
              mechanisms of action. In a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important genes lacking
              associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. By incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER
              provides context for genetic associations and identifies potential
              targets that may be overlooked in single-gene approaches. Genes
              collaborate to execute their functions in specific contexts,
              necessitating a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across various conditions. This insight is essential for the
              development of innovative therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in
              disease-related mechanisms; however, contemporary models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions
              play a pivotal role in disease initiation and progression.

              The current literature on genetic studies and functional genomics
              predominantly focuses on single-gene strategies to understand the
              etiology of diseases and their response to pharmaceutical
              interventions. However, this approach has limitations as it fails
              to capture the complex interactions between genes that are crucial
              in disease progression. Our manuscript aims to fill this gap by
              introducing PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach
              is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns

              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. We demonstrate
              the effectiveness of our method using a CRISPR screen to analyze
              lipid regulation, where we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated

              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. In

              that can enhance our understanding of complex traits, disease
              etiology, and drug mechanisms. This will ultimately help in the

              The field of complex trait analysis has long sought to understand
              the interplay between genes and their influence on disease
              mechanisms. Current state-of-the-art methods primarily focus on
              single-gene strategies, which fail to capture the intricate
              gene-gene interactions that are crucial for disease origin and
              progression. To address this gap in the literature, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action, as demonstrated through a CRISPR
              screen analysis of lipid regulation. Furthermore, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This study
              highlights the broader significance of our approach, which
              provides a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions and contributes to the development of
              new therapies for complex traits.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for
              comprehensive analysis. This approach is based on modules of genes
              exhibiting similar expression patterns under the same conditions.
              We demonstrate that diseases are significantly linked to gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method
              effectively predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates their
              mechanisms of action. Utilizing a CRISPR screen for lipid
              regulation, we discover that functionally significant players lack
              associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules
              by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals
              potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene
              approaches. Genes collaborate with one another in specific
              circumstances to carry out their functions. Understanding how
              these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic
              comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions.
              This knowledge is essential for the development of novel
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been
              instrumental in elucidating the role of individual genes in
              disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the
              architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions
              play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression.

              the complex interplay between genes and their roles in disease
              mechanisms. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed

              becoming increasingly clear that gene-gene interactions play a
              crucial role in disease origin and progression. This has left a
              significant gap in our knowledge regarding how genes act in
              concert with each other across different conditions to perform

              In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              representation for comprehensive analysis. This representation is
              derived from modules of co-expressed genes across similar
              conditions, which allows us to identify significant associations
              between diseases and relevant gene modules. PhenoPLIER
              demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs
              and elucidating their mechanisms of action. A CRISPR screen
              analysis on lipid regulation reveals that functionally important
              players may lack direct associations but are prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a contextual understanding
              of genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that might
              be overlooked by single-gene strategies. Genes often collaborate
              in specific contexts to execute their functions, necessitating a
              mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across diverse
              conditions. This understanding is essential for the development of
              innovative therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies
              have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-related
              mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest
              that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease
              initiation and progression.

              In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding
              the genetic basis of complex diseases and identifying potential
              therapeutic targets. However, current research has primarily
              focused on single-gene strategies, which may not capture the full
              complexity of gene-gene interactions that contribute to disease
              development. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach that combines gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent

              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions, allowing us to identify diseases associated with
              specific gene modules in relevant cell types. We demonstrate that
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action, as well as prioritizes functionally
              important players that lack associations but are present in
              trait-associated modules. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our
              results highlight the importance of understanding gene expression
              regulation across different conditions to uncover the mechanisms
              underlying complex traits and inform the development of new

              In the field of computational biology, there is a growing need to
              understand the complex interplay between genes, traits, and
              pharmacological perturbations. Existing research has focused on
              mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data, but these approaches have not adequately addressed the
              specific gap in understanding how gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types are associated with diseases. This gap is
              significant because it limits our ability to predict known
              drug-disease pairs, infer mechanisms of action, and prioritize
              functionally important players in trait-associated modules. To
              address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. Our method is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions, which allows us to
              observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER's accuracy in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action demonstrates its potential value in the broader field of
              computational biology. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This
              approach contributes to a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions, which is critical for
              developing new therapies targeting complex traits.


              In conclusion, our study fills the gap in the literature by
              introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              This method highlights functionally important players in
              trait-associated modules, providing valuable insights into
              gene-gene interactions and their role in disease origin and
              progression. By contextualizing genetic associations and revealing
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, PhenoPLIER
              contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay
              between genes, traits, and pharmacological perturbations,
              ultimately moving the broader field of computational biology
              forward.

              In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method
              that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on groups of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates
              mechanisms of action. Utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. By incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER
              contextualizes genetic associations and identifies potential
              targets that may be missed by single-gene approaches. Genes
              collaborate with one another in specific contexts to carry out
              their functions. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across various conditions is essential for elucidating
              how these genes influence complex traits, which is crucial for the
              development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have helped reveal the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms; however, contemporary models of the
              architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions
              play a pivotal role in disease initiation and progression.

              The current literature on genetic studies has primarily focused on
              single-gene strategies to understand the etiology of diseases and
              their associated drug mechanisms. However, this approach has
              overlooked the importance of gene co-expression and functional
              genomics in elucidating the complex interplay between genes that
              contribute to disease progression. This study aims to address this
              gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. By analyzing
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs

              In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding
              the role of gene-gene interactions in the development and
              progression of complex diseases. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have shed light on the individual genes
              involved in disease-relevant mechanisms, these approaches often
              overlook the importance of gene-gene interactions. This study aims
              to fill this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. The method is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions, which are found to
              be significantly associated with diseases in relevant cell types.
              PhenoPLIER demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease
              pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR
              screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that functionally
              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. This novel approach provides a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different
              conditions, which is critical for developing new therapies
              targeting complex traits.


              In conclusion, the development of PhenoPLIER not only fills the
              gap in the current literature regarding gene-gene interactions but
              also offers promising insights into the molecular mechanisms
              underlying complex diseases. By providing a comprehensive view of
              gene associations and their functional relevance, this
              computational approach has the potential to advance our
              understanding of disease pathways and inform the development of
              targeted therapies.

              Genetic studies have long been at the forefront of understanding
              complex traits and their underlying mechanisms; however, the
              current state-of-the-art approaches often fail to account for
              gene-gene interactions, which are crucial in disease origin and
              progression. This gap in literature motivated the development of a
              novel computational approach called PhenoPLIER, which aims to
              address this limitation by mapping gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. The core of PhenoPLIER lies in
              the identification of modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across different conditions, thereby facilitating the
              contextualization of genetic associations and the discovery of
              potential targets that may have been overlooked by single-gene
              strategies. In our study, we demonstrate the accuracy of
              PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action, as well as its ability to identify
              functionally important players that lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules. The use of a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation further supports the
              effectiveness of PhenoPLIER in uncovering gene co-expression
              patterns and their role in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
              Overall, our results highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER as a
              valuable tool for functional genomics research, offering new
              insights into the complex interplay between genes, traits, and
              diseases, and paving the way for more effective therapeutic
              targets and drug repurposing strategies.

              In the field of gene regulation, understanding how specific genes
              collaborate to influence complex traits is essential for
              developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have provided insights into individual gene roles in
              disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a significant role in disease origin and
              progression. Currently, there is a gap in the literature regarding
              the accurate prediction of known drug-disease pairs and the
              identification of mechanisms of action. To address this, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes across
              the same conditions, allowing PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic
              associations and uncover potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our
              approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of gene
              regulation in disease mechanisms, ultimately contributing to the
              development of new therapies.

              In this study, we investigate the concerted actions of genes in
              specific contexts to elucidate their roles in complex traits. To
              achieve this, we focus on understanding the regulation of gene
              expression across different conditions, as this knowledge is
              essential for developing novel therapeutic approaches. We employ
              transcriptome-wide association studies to uncover the role of
              individual genes in disease-related mechanisms and explore the
              significance of gene-gene interactions in disease initiation and
              progression. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action.


              To further enhance our understanding, we utilize a CRISPR screen
              to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated

              of potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies.


              In summary, our study highlights the importance of gene expression
              patterns and functional genomics in understanding disease etiology
              and drug mechanisms. By leveraging PhenoPLIER's ability to analyze
              gene co-expression, we aim to uncover previously overlooked

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              collaborate to influence complex traits requires an in-depth
              examination of expression regulation across various conditions.
              This knowledge is essential for developing new therapeutic
              approaches. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
              light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms,
              modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal
              role in both disease etiology and progression. Our study reveals a
              strong association between diseases and gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and our approach demonstrates accuracy in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of
              action. We also utilize a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation and find that functionally significant players lack
              associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules
              by PhenoPLIER. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on groups of co-expressed
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              By incorporating these co-expressed gene modules, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and unveil potential
              therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene
              strategies, thereby highlighting the broader significance of our
              findings in the field of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              In concert, genes influence complex traits through specific
              expression regulation patterns across different conditions.
              Understanding these patterns is essential for developing novel
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms; however,

              In the field of genetics, understanding how genes interact with
              one another in specific contexts to perform their functions is
              crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin
              and progression. Existing approaches, however, struggle with
              accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. To address this gap, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions, allowing for contextualization of genetic
              associations and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER not only fills this gap but also moves the broader
              field forward in understanding gene interactions and their role in
              complex traits and disease progression.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              Genes collaborate to carry out their functions in specific
              situations, necessitating a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions for elucidating
              the influence of genes on complex traits. This insight is crucial
              for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have helped unveil the roles of individual genes in
              disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are
              pivotal in disease initiation and progression. We find that
              diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover,
              employing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discover that
              functionally significant players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In this
              study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on groups of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating co-expressed
              gene clusters, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
              and reveal potential targets that may be missed by single-gene
              approaches.


              In the revised abstract, we have emphasized the significance of
              gene-gene interactions in disease initiation and progression,
              introduced PhenoPLIER as a computational approach for mapping
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data, and

              Genetic studies have long been a crucial aspect of understanding
              complex traits and diseases; however, the current state-of-the-art
              approaches often focus on individual genes rather than their
              interactions. This limitation has left a significant gap in our
              ability to comprehend disease etiology and drug mechanisms fully.
              To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on modules
              of co-expressed genes across the same conditions, allowing us to
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies.


              In this study, we demonstrate that our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our method not only
              provides a more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology
              and drug mechanisms but also offers new insights into therapeutic
              targets and the potential for drug repurposing.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies has significant broader implications for functional
              genomics research. By integrating gene co-expression data with
              pharmacological perturbation information, our approach offers a
              powerful tool for identifying novel therapeutic targets and
              deepening our understanding of disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms.

              In the field of genomics, understanding how genes work together in
              specific contexts is crucial for uncovering the mechanisms behind
              complex traits and developing new therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable
              insights into the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play
              a significant role in disease origin and progression. The current
              literature, however, lacks a comprehensive computational approach
              to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              gap in knowledge is particularly relevant given the increasing
              importance of understanding gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types for disease association studies. 


              To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent

              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach
              has been validated through accurate predictions of known
              drug-disease pairs and inferences of mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. 


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a significant advancement in the
              field of genomics by providing a comprehensive computational
              approach to analyze gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data. This approach not only fills an important gap
              in the current literature but also has broader significance as it
              can help in uncovering the mechanisms behind complex traits,
              informing new therapeutic strategies, and improving our
              understanding of disease origins and progression.

              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts,
              necessitating a comprehensive understanding of expression
              regulation across various conditions for elucidating the influence
              of genes on complex traits. This knowledge is crucial for
              advancing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have been instrumental in uncovering individual gene roles in
              disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait
              architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in
              determining disease onset and progression. We observe a strong
              correlation between diseases and gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and our approach is successful in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action.
              Employing a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally significant players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Here, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on groups of co-expressed genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By
              incorporating co-expression networks, PhenoPLIER can contextualize
              genetic associations and reveal potential targets that may be
              overlooked by single-gene approaches.


              In this revised paragraph, we have emphasized the importance of
              understanding gene interactions in disease progression and
              introduced PhenoPLIER as a computational method to map gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified
              representation for joint analysis. This approach incorporates
              co-expression networks to contextualize genetic associations and

              Genetic studies have long been crucial in understanding complex
              traits and their associations with diseases; however, the current
              state-of-the-art approaches primarily focus on individual genes,
              overlooking the potential role of gene-gene interactions in
              disease origin and progression. In this context, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that aims to fill this
              gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This approach is based on modules of co-expressed genes,
              which allows for the simultaneous analysis of multiple genetic
              associations. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. In our study,
              we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, highlighting
              its utility in the field of functional genomics and therapeutic
              target identification.


              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to analyze gene-trait
              associations through co-expression modules offers a significant
              advancement in the understanding of complex traits and their
              association with diseases. This approach not only improves our
              knowledge of disease etiology but also aids in the discovery of
              new therapeutic targets and drug mechanisms. By moving beyond
              single-gene analysis, PhenoPLIER has broader significance for the
              field of functional genomics, as it enables researchers to explore
              gene-gene interactions and their role in disease progression more
              effectively.


              In summary, our study presents a novel computational approach,
              PhenoPLIER, which maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis based on modules of co-expressed genes. This method
              offers significant advancements in the understanding of complex
              traits and their association with diseases by incorporating groups
              of co-expressed genes, thereby revealing potential targets missed
              by single-gene strategies. The accurate prediction of known
              drug-disease pairs and inference of mechanisms of action
              demonstrated by PhenoPLIER highlight its utility in the field of
              functional genomics and therapeutic target identification.

              In the field of genetics, understanding how genes collaborate in
              specific contexts is crucial for unraveling their functions and
              developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease
              mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play
              a vital role in disease origin and progression. Currently, there
              exists a gap in the literature regarding computational approaches
              that can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer
              mechanisms of action while also incorporating gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types. In this paper, we address this
              gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
              into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Based on

              associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. This method not only fills the current gap in the
              literature but also has broader significance as it contributes to
              the development of more effective therapeutic approaches for
              complex diseases.

              In complex traits, genes collaborate under specific circumstances
              to carry out their functions. Understanding how these genes
              influence complex traits necessitates elucidating the regulatory
              mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions. This
              knowledge is crucial for developing new therapeutic strategies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped elucidate the
              role of individual genes in disease-related processes. However,
              contemporary models of the architecture of complex traits propose
              that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset
              and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns

              In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes
              interact with each other is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms
              behind complex traits and developing new therapies. However,
              current methods primarily focus on individual gene associations,
              which may overlook important gene-gene interactions that
              contribute to disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression
              patterns across different conditions. By incorporating these gene
              groups, PhenoPLIER provides a more comprehensive understanding of
              genetic associations, revealing potential targets that may be
              missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach demonstrates
              significant associations between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lacking associations are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This work
              not only advances the understanding of gene co-expression in
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms but also highlights the
              potential of PhenoPLIER for therapeutic target identification and

            Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
            their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex
            traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
            across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we

            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
            the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
            PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
            potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that
            diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
            relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
            known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
            Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
            find that functionally important players lack associations but are

              Genes collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions,
              and understanding how these genes influence complex traits
              necessitates elucidating expression regulation across diverse
              conditions. This knowledge is vital for the development of novel
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in
              uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-related
              mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the architecture of
              complex traits propose that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal
              role in disease onset and progression. We present PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is grounded
              in modules of genes with analogous expression patterns across the
              same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and identify
              potential targets that might be missed by single-gene
              methodologies. We find that diseases are significantly linked to
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, utilizing a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally
              significant players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Genetic studies have been conducted extensively to understand the
              role of individual genes in disease mechanisms; however, the
              modern models of complex traits' architecture predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. In this context, there exists a gap in the current
              literature regarding the integration of gene expression patterns
              for a comprehensive analysis of genetic associations and their
              potential therapeutic targets. To address this gap, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions, allowing us to incorporate groups of
              co-expressed genes and contextualize genetic associations. Our
              results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
              lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, our approach not only fills the gap in
              current literature but also contributes to the broader field of
              functional genomics and drug mechanisms by providing a novel
              method for analyzing gene co-expression and identifying potential
              therapeutic targets that were previously missed by single-gene
              strategies.

              In concert with one another, genes play a crucial role in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. Understanding how these genes
              influence complex traits necessitates an understanding of
              expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is
              vital for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have been successful in unveiling the role of
              individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, current
              models predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in
              disease onset and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is built
              upon modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
              same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and identify
              potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. We
              find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.


              In this study, we developed PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              that may be missed by single-gene strategies. We observed
              significant associations between diseases and gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, as well as accurate predictions
              of known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action.
              Additionally, a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation revealed
              that functionally important players lacked associations but were
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              In summary, our study introduced PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint
              analysis. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results
              demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, as well as
              its ability to identify functionally important players that lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules.
              Overall, this study highlights the potential of PhenoPLIER as a
              valuable tool for understanding gene-gene interactions in disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately contributing to the
              development of new therapies and therapeutic targets.

              In the field of genomics, understanding the interplay between
              genes and their influence on complex traits is crucial for
              developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have shed light on individual gene roles in disease
              mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play
              a significant role in disease origin and progression. Here, we

              Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts,

              In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics,
              understanding how genes interact with each other to influence
              complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern
              models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role
              in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER,
              a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns
              across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. Our results show that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR

              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This research fills the
              gap in current literature by demonstrating how incorporating
              co-expressed genes can improve the identification of disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately moving the broader field
              forward.

              Genes collaborate in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex
              traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression
              regulation across varying conditions. This insight is vital for
              the development of innovative therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped elucidate the role of individual
              genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models
              of the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are crucial in determining the origin and progression
              of diseases. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is derived from modules of
              co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across the
              same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and identify
              potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. We
              find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of
              action. Moreover, utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we discover that functionally significant players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.

              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions, incorporating
              groups of co-expressed genes to provide a more accurate
              understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our results
              show that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action, and prioritizes functionally
              important players in trait-associated modules. By filling this gap
              in the literature, PhenoPLIER has the potential to advance our
              understanding of disease etiology and inform the development of
              new therapeutic targets.

              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence
              structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should
              follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been
              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              The field of genomics has long been focused on understanding the
              role of individual genes in complex traits and diseases. However,
              recent models suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial for
              disease origin and progression. Here, we address this gap by
              introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing for
              contextualization of genetic associations and potential target
              identification beyond single-gene strategies. We demonstrate that
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              mechanisms of action while prioritizing functionally important
              players in trait-associated modules. This approach not only
              contributes to the understanding of gene-gene interactions but
              also has broader significance for the development of new therapies
              targeting complex traits and diseases.
