          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to

          traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation

      response:
        output: ' Genes function in concert with one another within specific contexts to carry out their roles. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates an appreciation of expression regulation across different conditions. This knowledge is essential for developing new therapeutic approaches. Transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the architecture of complex traits propose that gene-gene interactions are crucial in disease initiation and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is grounded in modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, revealing potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.'

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

           Genes function in concert with one another in specific contexts to perform their tasks. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates elucidating expression regulation across various conditions, a knowledge that is crucial for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped unveil the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease initiation and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by considering groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, facilitating insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          In the revised paragraph, the text is restructured to improve clarity
          and readability while maintaining the core message and information
          from the original abstract. The focus on PhenoPLIER's ability to
          incorporate co-expressed genes, its applications in understanding gene
          interactions, and its potential for revealing missed targets has been
          emphasized.

           Genes collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates an appreciation of expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed significantly to elucidating the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Through a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes allows PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and identify potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, with implications for disease etiology, drug mechanisms, and therapeutic target discovery.

          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown

          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of

          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,

          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

        output: ' In the broader field of genetics and disease etiology, researchers have long sought to understand how genes interact with each other in specific contexts to influence complex traits. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped elucidate the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. This gap in current literature underscores the need for novel computational approaches to better understand these interactions and their implications for drug development. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By analyzing modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, our approach reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. In a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These results highlight the potential of incorporating groups of co-expressed genes for contextualizing genetic associations and uncovering missed targets in single-gene strategies. Ultimately, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, with broader significance for advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.'

        output: ' We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Genes collaborate with one another in specific contexts to carry out their functions, necessitating an understanding of expression regulation across various conditions to elucidate how they influence complex traits. This insight is vital for the development of innovative therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have illuminated the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms; however, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER''s representation is grounded in modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action by significantly associating diseases with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally significant players are not associated but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.'

          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed

        output: ' The study of genetic associations has been a significant focus in recent years, with researchers exploring various aspects of gene expression and their impact on disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in understanding the origin and progression of complex traits. This paper introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that addresses this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. The method takes into account the concerted action of genes in specific contexts to perform their functions, which is essential for understanding how these genes influence complex traits and develop new therapies. By using modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, PhenoPLIER can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, the approach prioritizes functionally important players that lack associations but are included in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER''s ability to incorporate groups of co-expressed genes offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through gene modules, highlighting potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and contributing to the broader understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms in the field of functional genomics.'

        output: ' The current literature on genetic studies and functional genomics has primarily focused on individual genes in understanding complex traits and disease mechanisms, with little emphasis on the potential role of gene-gene interactions. However, modern models suggest that these interactions are crucial for unraveling the origin and progression of diseases. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across specific conditions, which we find to be significantly associated with diseases in relevant cell types. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we show that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, even when they lack existing associations. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER''s integration of groups of co-expressed genes provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, potentially revealing targets missed by single-gene strategies and shedding light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms.'

          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

           We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. Understanding how genes work together in specific contexts is essential for elucidating their roles in complex traits and developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the individual gene's role in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on groups of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, facilitating the identification of functional relationships and therapeutic targets in complex diseases.

          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in

          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

        output: ' In recent years, genetic studies have sought to understand the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, but modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Existing methods for analyzing gene expression data have focused on single genes, overlooking potential insights from groups of co-expressed genes. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, which we find to be significantly associated with diseases in relevant cell types.

Our results demonstrate that by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

           Genes collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions, necessitating an understanding of expression regulation across different conditions to unravel how they influence complex traits. This knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapies. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and unveil potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER presents a novel framework for deciphering genetic associations via the lens of gene modules, thereby highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

        output: ' In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact with one another to influence complex traits is essential for the development of new therapies. However, current research has not fully explored this aspect, leaving a significant gap in knowledge regarding disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our study aims to fill this gap by presenting a novel approach called PhenoPLIER that focuses on gene co-expression patterns across different conditions. We demonstrate that our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates the mechanisms of action, while also highlighting the importance of functionally significant players in trait-associated modules. Through this innovative framework, PhenoPLIER provides a comprehensive understanding of genetic associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, thereby revealing potential targets that may have been missed by single-gene strategies. In conclusion, our research contributes to the broader field by shedding light on gene expression patterns and their implications for disease etiology and drug mechanisms, opening new avenues for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing.'

           In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes influence complex traits requires insight into expression regulation across different conditions to facilitate the development of new therapies. Currently, a mechanistic understanding of these relationships is lacking, and this gap hinders progress in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our study aims to address this by investigating the association between gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and diseases. Here, we present a novel approach called PhenoPLIER that accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, our research demonstrates that incorporating groups of co-expressed genes through PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework provides a powerful tool for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, ultimately advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms in the field of genetic studies.

          Here's the revised paragraph following the context-content-conclusion
          (C-C-C) scheme:


          In the broad context of functional genomics, a significant gap exists
          in understanding how genes influence complex traits through expression
          regulation across different conditions, which is critical for
          developing new therapies. Our research aims to address this gap by
          investigating the association between gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types and diseases, providing a novel approach called
          PhenoPLIER that accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and

          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack

          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies, moving the field of genetic studies forward

          through the lens of gene modules in the pursuit of advancing our

        output: ' In the rapidly evolving field of functional genomics, understanding the complex interplay between genes and their expression patterns is crucial for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying disease etiology and drug response. Despite recent advancements in genetic studies and gene co-expression analyses, a gap remains in our ability to identify therapeutic targets and repurpose drugs effectively. This study aims to address this gap by proposing a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, that leverages gene module analysis to reveal disease associations and infer drug mechanisms. By utilizing CRISPR screening and lipid regulation analysis, we demonstrate the accuracy of our method in predicting known drug-disease pairs and identifying functionally important players. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only provides a unique framework for contextualizing genetic associations but also has the potential to unveil novel therapeutic targets missed by traditional single-gene strategies, ultimately contributing to the development of innovative treatments and drug repurposing initiatives.'

           Genes cooperate to perform their functions in specific contexts, and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes allows PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, facilitating the discovery of new therapeutic targets and elucidating drug mechanisms in complex diseases.

          The revised paragraph emphasizes the importance of understanding gene
          regulation in the context of complex traits and highlights the
          potential of PhenoPLIER as a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations and identifying new therapeutic targets.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

      response:
        output: ' Genetic studies have been at the forefront of understanding complex traits, but current methods are limited in their ability to capture the intricate relationships between genes and their functional consequences. Functional genomics provides a valuable approach for analyzing gene co-expression patterns, but existing techniques often fail to account for the dynamic nature of gene expression under varying conditions. This study aims to address this gap by proposing a novel method called PhenoPLIER that utilizes gene co-expression to identify potential therapeutic targets and predict drug mechanisms. Through an extensive analysis of lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER is capable of accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers a more comprehensive understanding of genetic associations and reveals potential targets that may be missed by traditional single-gene approaches. Overall, this study presents PhenoPLIER as a powerful tool for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, with broad implications for disease etiology and drug discovery.'

           Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts, and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped elucidate the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are essential for disease origin and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on groups of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          The revised abstract now accurately reflects the title and keywords of
          the manuscript while maintaining its original message. It highlights
          the importance of understanding gene interactions in disease
          progression and introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. The revised
          abstract also emphasizes the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, as well
          as its application in analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR
          screen.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

           Genes collaborate to execute their functions in specific contexts, and understanding how these genes impact complex traits necessitates an appreciation of expression regulation across diverse conditions. This insight is vital for the development of novel treatments. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in elucidating the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the architecture of complex traits propose that gene-gene interactions are crucial in the origin and progression of diseases. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. Our approach demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and it accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          In the revised paragraph, some minor grammar adjustments have been
          made to improve clarity and readability.

        output: ' In the context of understanding the interplay between genes and complex traits, current research has primarily focused on individual gene effects rather than their interactions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the role of single genes in disease mechanisms, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies. However, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are key to disease origin and progression. In response to this gap in the literature, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our approach not only fills the gap in understanding gene interactions but also contributes to the broader field of functional genomics and drug discovery.'

          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

        output: ' In the context of gene expression, multiple genes collaborate to perform their functions, and understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates an analysis of expression regulation across diverse conditions. This understanding is essential for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in elucidating the roles of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the origin and progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on groups of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly linked with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

           Genes collaborate in specific contexts to fulfill their functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates insight into expression regulation across different conditions. This knowledge is essential for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped elucidate the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origination and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is derived from modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Additionally, employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally essential players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          In summary, the revised abstract emphasizes the importance of
          understanding gene interactions and their role in disease origins and
          progression. It introduces PhenoPLIER as a computational tool that can
          map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data to a

          accurate in predicting drug-disease pairs, elucidating mechanisms of

          trait-associated modules.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

        output: ' In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact with one another is crucial for unraveling the mechanisms behind complex traits and developing new therapies. Traditional transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease progression; however, these methods do not adequately address the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease origin and development. Recognizing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is grounded in modules of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions, allowing us to accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by employing CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players are not associated with specific traits but can be prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This innovative approach not only enhances our understanding of gene expression patterns and their role in disease etiology but also offers promising implications for the development of targeted therapies and drug repurposing strategies.'

              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.

              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current

              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an

              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

               Genes function in concert with one another in specific contexts to perform their tasks. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates elucidating expression regulation across various conditions, a knowledge that is crucial for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped unveil the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease initiation and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by considering groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, facilitating insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              missed targets has been emphasized.

To address this gap in our understanding, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of action, and identifies functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, shedding light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms while moving the broader field forward in understanding complex traits and their underlying genetic associations.

In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework provides a powerful tool for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, shedding light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms.'

              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current

              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an

              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader

               We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Genes collaborate with one another in specific contexts to carry out their functions, necessitating an understanding of expression regulation across various conditions to elucidate how they influence complex traits. This insight is vital for the development of innovative therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have illuminated the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms; however, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is grounded in modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action by significantly associating diseases with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally significant players are not associated but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader

               We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for comprehensive analysis. Genes collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions, necessitating an understanding of expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is essential for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms; however, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is grounded in gene modules with similar expression patterns across shared conditions. We find that diseases are strongly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene methodologies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for decoding genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, facilitating a deeper understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

               The study of genetic associations has been a significant focus in recent years, with researchers exploring various aspects of gene expression and their impact on disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in understanding the origin and progression of complex traits. This paper introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that addresses this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. The method takes into account the concerted action of genes in specific contexts to perform their functions, which is essential for understanding how these genes influence complex traits and develop new therapies. By using modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, PhenoPLIER can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Moreover, the approach prioritizes functionally important players that lack associations but are included in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to incorporate groups of co-expressed genes offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through gene modules, highlighting potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and contributing to the broader understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms in the field of functional genomics.

              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.

              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

               We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. Understanding how genes work together in specific contexts is essential for elucidating their roles in complex traits and developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the individual gene's role in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on groups of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, facilitating the identification of functional relationships and therapeutic targets in complex diseases.

               In recent years, genetic studies have sought to understand the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, but modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Existing methods for analyzing gene expression data have focused on single genes, overlooking potential insights from groups of co-expressed genes. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, which we find to be significantly associated with diseases in relevant cell types. In our experiments, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, highlighting functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. Our results demonstrate that by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework offers a powerful tool for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, with broader significance for understanding disease etiology, drug mechanisms, and therapeutic target identification.

               In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact with one another to influence complex traits is essential for the development of new therapies. However, current research has not fully explored this aspect, leaving a significant gap in knowledge regarding disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our study aims to fill this gap by presenting a novel approach called PhenoPLIER that focuses on gene co-expression patterns across different conditions. We demonstrate that our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates the mechanisms of action, while also highlighting the importance of functionally significant players in trait-associated modules. Through this innovative framework, PhenoPLIER provides a comprehensive understanding of genetic associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, thereby revealing potential targets that may have been missed by single-gene strategies. In conclusion, our research contributes to the broader field by shedding light on gene expression patterns and their implications for disease etiology and drug mechanisms, opening new avenues for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing.

               In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes influence complex traits requires insight into expression regulation across different conditions to facilitate the development of new therapies. Currently, a mechanistic understanding of these relationships is lacking, and this gap hinders progress in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our study aims to address this by investigating the association between gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and diseases. Here, we present a novel approach called PhenoPLIER that accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, our research demonstrates that incorporating groups of co-expressed genes through PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework provides a powerful tool for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, ultimately advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms in the field of genetic studies.

              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme:


              In the broad context of functional genomics, a significant gap
              exists in understanding how genes influence complex traits through
              expression regulation across different conditions, which is
              critical for developing new therapies. Our research aims to
              address this gap by investigating the association between gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types and diseases, providing a
              novel approach called PhenoPLIER that accurately predicts known

            text: ' In the rapidly evolving field of functional genomics, understanding the complex interplay between genes and their expression patterns is crucial for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying disease etiology and drug response. Despite recent advancements in genetic studies and gene co-expression analyses, a gap remains in our ability to identify therapeutic targets and repurpose drugs effectively. This study aims to address this gap by proposing a novel approach, PhenoPLIER, that leverages gene module analysis to reveal disease associations and infer drug mechanisms. By utilizing CRISPR screening and lipid regulation analysis, we demonstrate the accuracy of our method in predicting known drug-disease pairs and identifying functionally important players. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only provides a unique framework for contextualizing genetic associations but also has the potential to unveil novel therapeutic targets missed by traditional single-gene strategies, ultimately contributing to the development of innovative treatments and drug repurposing initiatives.'

               Genes cooperate to perform their functions in specific contexts, and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes allows PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, facilitating the discovery of new therapeutic targets and elucidating drug mechanisms in complex diseases.

               Genetic studies have been at the forefront of understanding complex traits, but current methods are limited in their ability to capture the intricate relationships between genes and their functional consequences. Functional genomics provides a valuable approach for analyzing gene co-expression patterns, but existing techniques often fail to account for the dynamic nature of gene expression under varying conditions. This study aims to address this gap by proposing a novel method called PhenoPLIER that utilizes gene co-expression to identify potential therapeutic targets and predict drug mechanisms. Through an extensive analysis of lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER is capable of accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers a more comprehensive understanding of genetic associations and reveals potential targets that may be missed by traditional single-gene approaches. Overall, this study presents PhenoPLIER as a powerful tool for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, with broad implications for disease etiology and drug discovery.

               Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts, and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped elucidate the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are essential for disease origin and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on groups of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              The revised abstract now accurately reflects the title and
              keywords of the manuscript while maintaining its original message.

               Genes collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates elucidating expression regulation across diverse conditions. This knowledge is vital for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have assisted in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions are pivotal to disease origin and progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is grounded in modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. We discover that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we find that functionally crucial elements lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence
              structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should
              follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

               In the context of gene expression, multiple genes collaborate to perform their functions, and understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates an analysis of expression regulation across diverse conditions. This understanding is essential for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in elucidating the roles of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in the origin and progression of diseases. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on groups of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly linked with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Additionally, we employed a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and discovered that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence
              structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should
              follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.

               Genes collaborate in specific contexts to fulfill their functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates insight into expression regulation across different conditions. This knowledge is essential for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped elucidate the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origination and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is derived from modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Additionally, employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally essential players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              In summary, the revised abstract emphasizes the importance of
              understanding gene interactions and their role in disease origins
              and progression. It introduces PhenoPLIER as a computational tool
              that can map gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data to a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This approach is accurate in predicting drug-disease
              pairs, elucidating mechanisms of action, and prioritizing
              functionally important players in trait-associated modules.

            text: ' In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact with one another is crucial for unraveling the mechanisms behind complex traits and developing new therapies. Traditional transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease progression; however, these methods do not adequately address the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease origin and development. Recognizing this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is grounded in modules of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions, allowing us to accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by employing CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players are not associated with specific traits but can be prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This innovative approach not only enhances our understanding of gene expression patterns and their role in disease etiology but also offers promising implications for the development of targeted therapies and drug repurposing strategies.'
