 Genes collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions, necessitating an understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions to elucidate how they influence complex traits. This knowledge is crucial for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origination and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, revealing potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, providing valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

In this revised abstract, we have highlighted the importance of understanding gene-gene interactions in disease progression and the role of PhenoPLIER in incorporating co-expressed genes to reveal potential targets. Additionally, we emphasized the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, as well as the novel framework it provides for interpreting genetic associations through gene modules.">[FAIL] (0.88) Python code returned false

 In the era of genomics, understanding the complex interplay between genes and their role in determining human traits is essential to advance our knowledge in disease etiology and therapeutic targets. However, current single-gene approaches fall short in capturing the intricate nature of gene interactions in the context of disease progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that overcomes these limitations by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By leveraging gene co-expression modules across different conditions, our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, unveils mechanisms of action, and prioritizes functionally important players that are missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a robust framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, paving the way for more effective disease understanding and drug repurposing strategies in functional genomics.

This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions. We show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.</td>

Recognizing that genes collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions, understanding how these interactions influence complex traits requires insight into expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are essential in disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation relies on modules of co-expressed genes across conditions.

          <td data-content="[PASS] (1.00)  In the rapidly expanding field of functional genomics, understanding the complex interplay between genes and their expression patterns is crucial in uncovering disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Current research has largely focused on individual gene-disease associations, but recent studies suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By focusing on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and reveals the mechanisms of action.

 We present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts; thus, understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates examining expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is vital for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions are crucial for disease initiation and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is founded on modules of co-expressed genes across identical conditions. We discover that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and deduces mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we find that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, revealing potential targets that might be missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a groundbreaking framework for deciphering genetic associations via gene modules' lens.

In the revised paragraph, we have made changes to improve clarity and coherence. We replaced "PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions" with "PhenoPLIER's representation is founded on modules of co-expressed genes across identical conditions."

 The field of genetic studies has made significant progress in understanding the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, but current models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. This gap in knowledge motivates the development of a computational approach to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER is introduced as such an approach, focusing on modules of co-expressed genes across different conditions. By incorporating these groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. In a study of lipid regulation using CRISPR screening, functionally important players were found to lack associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules provides a promising avenue for understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately informing therapeutic targets and drug repurposing strategies.

In this paper, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Utilizing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we find that functionally crucial players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes allows PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.">[FAIL] (0.88) Python code returned false

 Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts, and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates a comprehensive grasp of expression regulation across varying conditions. This knowledge is crucial for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped elucidate the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms; however, contemporary models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in the origins and progression of diseases. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on groups of genes displaying similar expression patterns across identical conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and deciphers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.">[FAIL] (0.88) Python code returned false

Traditional methods have focused on individual gene associations, but modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are vital for elucidating disease origins and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

 Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates an appreciation of expression regulation across diverse conditions. Insights into this relationship are crucial for developing novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease initiation and progression. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for simultaneous analysis. This representation is grounded in modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, utilizing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we find that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

 Genes collaborate to carry out their functions in specific contexts, and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is crucial for the development of new therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have helped elucidate the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression. To address this, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on groups of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We discover that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.">[FAIL] (0.88) Python code returned false

 In the field of functional genomics, understanding the interplay between genes and their influence on complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, but modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are vital to understanding disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action using our approach. Furthermore, we show that functionally important players lacking associations can be prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting its potential for drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.">[FAIL] (0.88) Expected output to contain "CRISPR"
