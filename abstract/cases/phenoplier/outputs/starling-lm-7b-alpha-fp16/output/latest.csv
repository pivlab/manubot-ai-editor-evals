In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes interact with one another in specific contexts to perform their functions, and understanding these interactions is crucial for developing new therapies. However, current transcriptome-wide association studies primarily focus on individual genes and their roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, while modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, thereby moving the broader field forward.

In summary, we have developed PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis, based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.

In recent years, genetic studies have focused on understanding the roles of single genes in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However, the current literature lacks a comprehensive approach to analyze gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data simultaneously. This manuscript aims to fill this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that maps these two types of data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. The representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing for accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs and inference of drug mechanisms. Moreover, PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important players that lack associations but are present in trait-associated modules.

The field of genomics has long sought to understand the role of gene-gene interactions in the development and progression of diseases. Despite the advancements made by transcriptome-wide association studies, these approaches have primarily focused on single genes, potentially overlooking critical gene-gene interactions. This gap in the current literature underscores the need for a computational method that can effectively map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that leverages modules of co-expressed genes to bridge this gap. Through our research, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates the mechanisms of action for these associations. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking direct associations are prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This computational method not only advances our understanding of gene-gene interactions but also has the potential to inform the development of new therapies for complex diseases.

This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing for the contextualization of genetic associations and the identification of potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Through our approach, we accurately predict known drug-disease pairs, infer mechanisms of action, and prioritize functionally important players that lack associations but are found in trait-associated modules.

Genes collaborate in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across varying conditions. This insight is vital for the development of innovative therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped elucidate the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial in determining the origin and progression of diseases. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is derived from modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and identify potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

In this revised abstract, the text has been improved for clarity and readability while retaining the original information. The focus on the importance of gene-gene interactions, the role of co-expressed genes in contextualizing genetic associations, and the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action have been emphasized.

In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes work together in specific contexts to influence complex traits is essential for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are crucial for disease origin and progression. The current literature, however, lacks a comprehensive approach to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes to provide a more accurate understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Our results show that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, and prioritizes functionally important players in trait-associated modules. By filling this gap in the literature, PhenoPLIER has the potential to advance our understanding of disease etiology and inform the development of new therapeutic targets.

The field of genomics has long been focused on understanding the role of individual genes in complex traits and diseases. However, recent models suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial for disease origin and progression. Here, we address this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing for contextualization of genetic associations and potential target identification beyond single-gene strategies. We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action while prioritizing functionally important players in trait-associated modules. This approach not only contributes to the understanding of gene-gene interactions but also has broader significance for the development of new therapies targeting complex traits and diseases.
