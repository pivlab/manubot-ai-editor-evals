 We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological intervention data into a shared latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes often collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of expression across varying conditions, which is crucial for advancing novel therapeutic approaches. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in disease-related mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease initiation and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation relies on gene modules with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we discover that functionally crucial players lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and identify potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby illuminating disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

 In the field of genetics, understanding the coordinated action of genes in specific contexts is crucial for gaining insight into their roles in influencing complex traits. This knowledge has significant implications for developing new therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern architectural models of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions are essential in determining disease origin and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER in uncovering disease etiology and drug mechanisms through the analysis of gene expression patterns and co-expression networks.

 Genes collaborate in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how these genes impact complex traits necessitates an appreciation of expression regulation across diverse conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for the development of novel treatments. Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in uncovering the roles of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions are essential in the onset and progression of diseases. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is established on modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions. Our findings show that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

The introduction of PhenoPLIER as a computational approach for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation is highlighted.
