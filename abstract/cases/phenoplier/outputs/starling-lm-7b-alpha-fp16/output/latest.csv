While transcriptome-wide association studies have been successful in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap in current literature, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allowing diseases to be significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Using PhenoPLIER, we accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, as well as identify functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.<|end_of_turn|>

In the field of functional genomics, understanding how genes interact in specific contexts to influence complex traits is crucial for developing new therapies. However, current methods fall short in providing a comprehensive understanding of these mechanisms. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that integrates gene co-expression networks with functional genomics data to identify disease-associated modules and predict drug-disease pairs. Our results demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known associations and inferring mechanisms of action, as well as its ability to prioritize functionally important players that lack traditional genetic associations. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER not only contextualizes genetic associations but also reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

However, current methods primarily focus on individual gene associations in disease mechanisms. This study aims to address this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By leveraging modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER in identifying functionally important players that lack traditional associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules. This research significantly contributes to the broader understanding of gene co-expression networks and their role in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, highlighting the potential for therapeutic targets and drug repurposing through clustering of complex traits.<|end_of_turn|>

In the field of gene expression and its role in complex traits, a significant gap exists in our understanding of gene-gene interactions and their impact on disease origin and progression. Current methods, such as transcriptome-wide association studies, have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, they fall short in capturing the intricate dynamics of gene-gene interactions. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions, allowing for the identification of diseases associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, while also prioritizing functionally important players that lack associations but are present in trait-associated modules. Overall, our approach not only fills the existing gap in understanding gene-gene interactions but also contributes to the broader field by providing a powerful tool for analyzing complex traits and their relationship with disease progression.<|end_of_turn|>

Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts; understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates an appreciation of expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is vital for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease initiation and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts, and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is vital for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped unveil the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on groups of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We discover that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

In the revised paragraph, we have emphasized the importance of understanding gene interactions and their role in disease onset and progression. Additionally, we have highlighted the accuracy of our approach in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action. Lastly, we have included a new finding from the CRISPR screen analysis, which demonstrates the prioritization of functionally important players by PhenoPLIER.<|end_of_turn|>
