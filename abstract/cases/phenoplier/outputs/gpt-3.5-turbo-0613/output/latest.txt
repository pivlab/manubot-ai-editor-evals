          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions.
          To understand how these genes influence complex traits, it is
          important to have a mechanistic understanding of gene expression
          regulation under different conditions. This understanding is crucial
          for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
          in disease mechanisms, modern models of complex traits suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are also important in disease origin and
          progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that
          functionally important players may lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide
          context to genetic associations and identify potential targets that
          may be missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
          different conditions. This understanding is crucial for developing new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
          uncover the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern
          models of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are also
          important in disease origin and progression. In this manuscript, we

          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. Our analysis reveals that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers

          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by

          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions.
          To understand how these genes influence complex traits, it is
          important to have a mechanistic understanding of gene expression
          regulation under different conditions. This understanding is crucial
          for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
          in disease mechanisms, modern models of complex traits suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are also important in disease origin and
          progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that
          functionally important players may lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion,
          by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide
          context to genetic associations and identify potential targets that
          may be missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel

          gene modules.

          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
          different conditions. This understanding is crucial for developing new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
          uncover the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern
          models of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are also
          important in disease origin and progression. In this manuscript, we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. Our analysis reveals that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of
          co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and identify
          potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. This
          novel framework provides a valuable tool for interpreting genetic
          associations through the lens of gene modules, advancing our
          understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          drivers of disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER represents genes
          as modules with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation,
          we discover that functionally important genes, which lack individual
          associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating co-expressed gene groups,
          PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential
          targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through
          the lens of gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring

          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack

          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for joint analysis. Genes work together
          in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding
          how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
          understanding of gene expression regulation across different
          conditions. This understanding is crucial for the development of new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern
          models of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are key
          drivers of disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER represents genes
          as modules with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation,
          we discover that functionally important genes, which lack individual
          associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating co-expressed gene groups,
          PhenoPLIER provides a contextualized interpretation of genetic
          associations and uncovers potential targets that may be missed by
          single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for
          understanding genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, understanding

          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a
          novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
          of gene modules, filling a gap in the current literature and offering
          new insights for therapeutic targets and drug repurposing.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, understanding
          how genes influence complex traits is crucial for developing new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, it is now
          recognized that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in
          disease origin and progression. To address this, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER's representation is
          based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
          same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, we use a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally
          important players lacking associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a
          novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
          of gene modules, filling a gap in the current literature and offering
          new insights for therapeutic targets and drug repurposing.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions.
          To understand how these genes influence complex traits, it is crucial
          to have a mechanistic understanding of how gene expression is
          regulated under different conditions. This understanding is essential
          for the development of new therapies. Our study demonstrates that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules that are
          expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and provides insights into the mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation and found that functionally important players, although
          lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by considering groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and
          identify potential targets that may be missed by single-gene
          strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
          different conditions. This understanding is crucial for the
          development of new therapies. However, there is still a gap in the
          current literature regarding the association between diseases and gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. In this study, we aimed to
          fill this gap by investigating the relationship between diseases and
          gene modules. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          Additionally, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and provides insights into the mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, we conducted a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation
          and found that functionally important players lack associations but
          are prioritized in trait-associated modules by our approach, called
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, our study shows that by incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide a contextualized
          interpretation of genetic associations and identify potential targets
          that may be missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework has
          broader significance as it offers a new perspective for understanding
          genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated

          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
          different conditions. This understanding is crucial for the
          development of new therapies. However, there is still a gap in the
          current literature regarding the association between diseases and gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. In this study, we aimed to
          fill this gap by investigating the relationship between diseases and
          gene modules. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          Additionally, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and provides insights into the mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, we conducted a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation
          and found that functionally important players lack associations but
          are prioritized in trait-associated modules by our approach, called
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, our study shows that by incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide a contextualized
          interpretation of genetic associations and identify potential targets

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions.
          To understand how these genes influence complex traits, it is crucial
          to have a mechanistic understanding of how gene expression is
          regulated under different conditions. This understanding is essential
          for the development of new therapies. Our study demonstrates that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules that are
          expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and provides insights into the mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation and found that functionally important players, although
          lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by considering groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and
          identify potential targets that may be missed by single-gene
          strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
          different conditions. This understanding is crucial for the
          development of new therapies. However, there is still a gap in the
          current literature regarding the association between diseases and gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types. In this study, we aimed to
          fill this gap by investigating the relationship between diseases and
          gene modules. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          Additionally, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and provides insights into the mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, we conducted a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation
          and found that functionally important players lack associations but
          are prioritized in trait-associated modules by our approach, called
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, our study shows that by incorporating

          interpretation of genetic associations and identify potential targets
          that may be missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework has
          broader significance as it offers a new perspective for understanding

          To understand how these genes influence complex traits, it is
          important to have a mechanistic understanding of how gene expression
          is regulated under different conditions. This understanding is crucial

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
          different conditions. This understanding is crucial for the
          development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease
          mechanisms, modern models of complex traits suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are also important in disease origin and progression. In
          this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. Our analysis reveals that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, we
          use a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation and find that
          functionally important players, which lack associations, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, our
          findings highlight the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms, providing valuable insights for
          therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing efforts.

          To understand how these genes influence complex traits, it is

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
          different conditions. This understanding is crucial for developing new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
          uncover the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern
          models of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are also
          important in disease origin and progression. In this manuscript, we
          present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. Our analysis reveals that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, we use a CRISPR screen to study
          lipid regulation and find that functionally important players, which
          lack associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of
          gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms,
          providing valuable insights for therapeutic target identification and
          drug repurposing efforts.

          To understand how these genes influence complex traits, it is

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
          different conditions. This understanding is crucial for developing new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
          uncover the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern
          models of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are also
          important in disease origin and progression. In this manuscript, we
          present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. Our analysis reveals that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, we use a CRISPR screen to study
          lipid regulation and find that functionally important players, which
          lack associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of
          gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms,
          providing valuable insights for therapeutic target identification and
          drug repurposing.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions.
          To understand how these genes influence complex traits, it is
          important to have a mechanistic understanding of how gene expression
          is regulated under different conditions. This understanding is crucial
          for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
          different conditions. This understanding is crucial for the
          development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease
          mechanisms, modern models of complex traits suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are also important in disease origin and progression. In
          this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. Our analysis reveals that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, we
          use a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation and find that
          functionally important players, which lack associations, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, our
          findings highlight the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms, providing valuable insights for
          therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing efforts.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
          different conditions. This understanding is crucial for the
          development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease
          mechanisms, modern models of complex traits suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are also important in disease origin and progression. In
          this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. Our analysis reveals that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, we
          use a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation and find that
          functionally important players, which lack associations, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, our
          findings highlight the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms, providing valuable insights for
          therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing efforts.

              it is important to have a mechanistic understanding of gene
              expression regulation under different conditions. This

              While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover

            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
            same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
            analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of
            co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
            associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene
            strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
            genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions. To understand how these genes influence complex traits,
              it is important to have a mechanistic understanding of gene
              expression regulation under different conditions. This
              understanding is crucial for the development of new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover

              conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and

              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.

              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current

              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an

              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions. To understand how these genes influence complex traits,
              it is important to have a mechanistic understanding of gene
              expression regulation under different conditions. This
              understanding is crucial for the development of new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models
              of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are also

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex
              traits requires a mechanistic understanding of gene expression
              regulation across different conditions. This understanding is
              crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease mechanisms, modern models of complex traits
              suggest that gene-gene interactions are also important in disease
              origin and progression. In this manuscript, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions. Our analysis reveals that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of co-expressed genes
              to contextualize genetic associations and identify potential
              targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. This novel
              framework provides a valuable tool for interpreting genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules, advancing our
              understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

              abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence
              structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should
              follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out
              their functions, and understanding how these genes influence

              expression regulation across different conditions. This
              understanding is crucial for the development of new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models
              of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are key
              drivers of disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER represents
              genes as modules with similar expression patterns across the same

              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our

              lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important genes,
              which lack individual associations, are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
              incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER provides a
              contextualized interpretation of genetic associations and uncovers
              potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies.

              In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics,
              understanding how genes influence complex traits is crucial for
              developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association

              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out
              their functions, and understanding how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of gene
              expression regulation across different conditions. This
              understanding is crucial for the development of new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models
              of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are key
              drivers of disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER represents
              genes as modules with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to study
              lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important genes,
              which lack individual associations, are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
              incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER contextualizes
              genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that may be
              missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
              of gene modules.

              In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics,
              understanding how genes influence complex traits is crucial for

              abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence
              structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should
              follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

            We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
            gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
            common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in
            concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
            functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
            requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
            different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's
            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
            patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
            significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
            cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
            drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
            using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
            functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
            in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
            incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
            contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
            missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel

              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out
              their functions, and understanding how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of gene
              expression regulation across different conditions. This
              understanding is crucial for the development of new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models
              of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are key
              drivers of disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER represents
              genes as modules with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to study
              lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important genes,
              which lack individual associations, are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
              incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER provides a
              contextualized interpretation of genetic associations and uncovers
              potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies.
              PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for understanding genetic
              associations through the lens of gene modules.

              abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence
              structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should
              follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, we use a CRISPR screen
              to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally important
              players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. Overall, PhenoPLIER provides a novel
              framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens
              of gene modules, filling a gap in the current literature and
              offering new insights for therapeutic targets and drug
              repurposing.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence
              structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should
              follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that
              this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of
              genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex
              traits requires a mechanistic understanding of gene expression
              regulation across different conditions. This understanding is
              crucial for the development of new therapies. However, there is
              still a gap in the current literature regarding the association
              between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types. In this study, we aimed to fill this gap by investigating
              the relationship between diseases and gene modules. Our results
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. Additionally, our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and provides
              insights into the mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we conducted
              a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by our approach, called
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, our study shows that by incorporating

              contextualized interpretation of genetic associations and identify
              potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies.
              This novel framework has broader significance as it offers a new
              perspective for understanding genetic associations through the

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex
              traits requires a mechanistic understanding of gene expression
              regulation across different conditions. This understanding is
              crucial for the development of new therapies. However, there is
              still a gap in the current literature regarding the association
              between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types. In this study, we aimed to fill this gap by investigating
              the relationship between diseases and gene modules. Our results
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. Additionally, our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and provides
              insights into the mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we conducted
              a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by our approach, called
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, our study shows that by incorporating
              groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide a
              contextualized interpretation of genetic associations and identify
              potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies.
              This novel framework has broader significance as it offers a new
              perspective for understanding genetic associations through the
              lens of gene modules.

              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex
              traits requires a mechanistic understanding of gene expression
              regulation across different conditions. This understanding is
              crucial for the development of new therapies. However, there is
              still a gap in the current literature regarding the association
              between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types. In this study, we aimed to fill this gap by investigating
              the relationship between diseases and gene modules. Our results
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types. Additionally, our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and provides
              insights into the mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we conducted
              a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by our approach, called
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, our study shows that by incorporating
              groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide a
              contextualized interpretation of genetic associations and identify
              potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies.
              This novel framework has broader significance as it offers a new
              perspective for understanding genetic associations through the
              lens of gene modules.

              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question

              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current

              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions. To understand how these genes influence complex traits,
              it is crucial to have a mechanistic understanding of how gene
              expression is regulated under different conditions. This
              understanding is essential for the development of new therapies.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions. To understand how these genes influence complex traits,
              it is important to have a mechanistic understanding of how gene
              expression is regulated under different conditions. This
              understanding is crucial for the development of new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, it is now
              recognized that gene-gene interactions play a key role in the
              origin and progression of complex traits. In this study, we
              present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we discover that
              functionally important genes, which lack individual associations,
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence
              structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should
              follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence
              structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should
              follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been
              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions. To understand how these genes influence complex traits,
              it is important to have a mechanistic understanding of how gene
              expression is regulated under different conditions. This
              understanding is crucial for the development of new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, it is now
              recognized that gene-gene interactions play a key role in the
              origin and progression of complex traits. In this study, we
              present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we discover that
              functionally important genes, which lack individual associations,
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions. To understand how these genes influence complex traits,
              it is important to have a mechanistic understanding of how gene
              expression is regulated under different conditions. This
              understanding is crucial for the development of new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, it is now
              recognized that gene-gene interactions play a key role in the
              origin and progression of complex traits. In this study, we
              present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we discover that
              functionally important genes, which lack individual associations,
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.

            Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
            their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex
            traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
            across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
            the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
            to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER.
