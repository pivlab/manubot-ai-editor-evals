Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions. This understanding is crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are also important in disease origin and progression. In this manuscript, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our analysis reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and identify potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework provides a valuable tool for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions. This understanding is crucial for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are key drivers of disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER represents genes as modules with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important genes, which lack individual associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions. To understand how these genes influence complex traits, it is crucial to have a mechanistic understanding of how gene expression is regulated under different conditions. This understanding is essential for the development of new therapies. Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules that are expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and provides insights into the mechanisms of action. Additionally, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by considering groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and identify potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions. This understanding is crucial for the development of new therapies. However, there is still a gap in the current literature regarding the association between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. In this study, we aimed to fill this gap by investigating the relationship between diseases and gene modules. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Additionally, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and provides insights into the mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we conducted a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by our approach, called PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, our study shows that by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide a contextualized interpretation of genetic associations and identify potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework has broader significance as it offers a new perspective for understanding genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions. This understanding is crucial for the development of new therapies. However, there is still a gap in the current literature regarding the association between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. In this study, we aimed to fill this gap by investigating the relationship between diseases and gene modules. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Additionally, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and provides insights into the mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we conducted a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by our approach, called PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, our study shows that by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide a contextualized interpretation of genetic associations and identify potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework has broader significance as it offers a new perspective for understanding genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions. To understand how these genes influence complex traits, it is important to have a mechanistic understanding of how gene expression is regulated under different conditions. This understanding is crucial for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, it is now recognized that gene-gene interactions play a key role in the origin and progression of complex traits. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important genes, which lack individual associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions. To understand how these genes influence complex traits, it is important to have a mechanistic understanding of how gene expression is regulated under different conditions. This understanding is crucial for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, it is now recognized that gene-gene interactions play a key role in the origin and progression of complex traits. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important genes, which lack individual associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
