          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions.
          To understand how these genes influence complex traits, it is
          important to have a mechanistic understanding of gene expression
          regulation under different conditions. This understanding is crucial
          for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
          in disease mechanisms, modern models of complex traits suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are also important in disease origin and
          progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that
          functionally important players may lack individual associations but
          are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
          conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can provide context to genetic associations and identify potential
          targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through
          the lens of gene modules.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions.
          To understand how these genes influence complex traits, it is

          regulation under different conditions. This understanding is crucial

          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions.
          To understand how these genes influence complex traits, it is
          important to have a mechanistic understanding of gene expression
          regulation under different conditions. This understanding is crucial
          for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
          in disease mechanisms, modern models of complex traits suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are also important in disease origin and

          approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that
          functionally important players may lack individual associations but
          are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
          conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can provide context to genetic associations and identify potential
          targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER

          regulation under different conditions. This understanding is crucial
          for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
          in disease mechanisms, modern models of complex traits suggest that
          gene-gene interactions are also important in disease origin and
          progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide
          context to genetic associations and identify potential targets that
          may be missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel
          framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
          gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation,
          we discover that functionally important genes, which lack individual
          associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER provides a contextualized interpretation of genetic
          associations and identifies potential targets that may be missed by
          single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for
          understanding genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the

          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context

          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader

          We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          unified latent representation for joint analysis. Genes work together
          in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding
          how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
          understanding of gene expression regulation across different
          conditions. This understanding is crucial for the development of new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern
          models of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are also
          important in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER represents
          genes as modules with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation,
          we discover that functionally important genes, which lack individual
          associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER provides a contextualized interpretation of genetic
          associations and identifies potential targets that may be missed by
          single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for
          understanding genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Input paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes
          act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based
          on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics, understanding
          the influence of genes on complex traits is crucial for developing new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, it is now
          recognized that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in
          disease origin and progression. To address this, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER's representation is
          based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
          same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, we use a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation and find that functionally
          important players lacking associations are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules, filling a gap in the current
          literature and offering potential for identifying therapeutic targets
          and drug repurposing opportunities.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions.
          To understand how these genes influence complex traits, it is crucial
          to have a mechanistic understanding of how gene expression is
          regulated under different conditions. This understanding is essential
          for the development of new therapies. Our study demonstrates that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules that are

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
          different conditions. This understanding is crucial for the
          development of new therapies. In this study, we demonstrate that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and provides insights into the mechanisms of

          regulation and find that functionally important players lack

          co-expressed genes, offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic
          associations and identifying potential targets that may be missed by
          single-gene strategies. This approach has the potential to advance our

          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our
          results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
          provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations
          through the lens of gene modules.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions.
          To understand how these genes influence complex traits, it is crucial
          to have a mechanistic understanding of how gene expression is
          regulated under different conditions. This understanding is essential
          for the development of new therapies. Our study demonstrates that

          regulation and found that functionally important players, although
          lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by considering groups of co-expressed

          identify potential targets that may be missed by single-gene
          strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting

          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          is regulated under different conditions. This understanding is crucial

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
          different conditions. This understanding is crucial for the
          development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease
          mechanisms, modern models of complex traits suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are also important in disease origin and progression. In
          this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a

          lipid regulation and found that functionally important players, which
          lack associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. This study fills the gap in understanding the role of
          gene-gene interactions in complex traits and provides a valuable tool
          for identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs.

          To understand how these genes influence complex traits, it is
          important to have a mechanistic understanding of how gene expression
          is regulated under different conditions. This understanding is crucial

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
          different conditions. This understanding is crucial for the
          development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease
          mechanisms, modern models of complex traits suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are also important in disease origin and progression. In
          this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a

          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our

          lipid regulation and found that functionally important players, which
          lack associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. This study fills the gap in understanding the role of
          gene-gene interactions in complex traits and provides a valuable tool
          for identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs.

          is regulated under different conditions. This understanding is crucial

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and
          follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a
          single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary
          to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
          follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the
          reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the
          reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
          research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on
          the open question that the research answered. A successful context
          section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions
          from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in
          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,
          and understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
          different conditions. This understanding is crucial for the
          development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease
          mechanisms, modern models of complex traits suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are also important in disease origin and progression. In
          this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Additionally, we used a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation and found that functionally important players, which
          lack associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. This study fills the gap in understanding the role of
          gene-gene interactions in complex traits and provides a valuable tool
          for identifying therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions.
          To understand how these genes influence complex traits, it is
          important to have a mechanistic understanding of how gene expression
          is regulated under different conditions. This understanding is crucial
          for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
          in disease mechanisms, it is now recognized that gene-gene
          interactions play a key role in the origin and progression of complex
          traits. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in

          functionally important genes, which lack individual associations, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.,
          the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that
          the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the
          novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question.
          Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
          Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question
          that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a
          second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this
          conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., "broader
          significance").

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions.
          To understand how these genes influence complex traits, it is
          important to have a mechanistic understanding of how gene expression
          is regulated under different conditions. This understanding is crucial
          for the development of new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
          in disease mechanisms, it is now recognized that gene-gene
          interactions play a key role in the origin and progression of complex
          traits. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
          using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we discover that
          functionally important genes, which lack individual associations, are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown

          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of

          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps

          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their functions,

            improving the text of a manuscript with title '{{ title }}' and
            keywords '{{ keywords }}.' Revise the following abstract of this
            manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a
            context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single
            paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to
            follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must
            follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to
            the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients
            the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular
            research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands
            on the open question that the research answered. A successful
            context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s
            contributions from the current state of the art by communicating
            what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
            that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the
            broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content ("Here
            we") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to
            fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive
            summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the
            results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the
            context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion
            section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field
            forward (i.e., "broader significance").

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions. To understand how these genes influence complex traits,
              it is important to have a mechanistic understanding of gene
              expression regulation under different conditions. This
              understanding is crucial for the development of new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models
              of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are also
              important in disease origin and progression. In this study, we
              present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover
              that functionally important players may lack individual
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and
              identify potential targets that may be missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

              have helped uncover the role of individual genes in

              significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are

              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions. To understand how these genes influence complex traits,
              it is important to have a mechanistic understanding of gene
              expression regulation under different conditions. This
              understanding is crucial for the development of new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models
              of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are also
              important in disease origin and progression. In this study, we

              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover
              that functionally important players lack associations but are

              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
            same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to
            analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of
            co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
            associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene
            strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions. To understand how these genes influence complex traits,
              it is important to have a mechanistic understanding of gene
              expression regulation under different conditions. This
              understanding is crucial for the development of new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models
              of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are also
              important in disease origin and progression. In this study, we
              present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar

              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover
              that functionally important players may lack individual
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and
              identify potential targets that may be missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting

              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different
              conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for
              developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have helped uncover the role of individual genes in

              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
              representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
              significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are

              conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal,

              provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint
              analysis. Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out
              their functions, and understanding how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of gene
              expression regulation across different conditions. This
              understanding is crucial for the development of new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models
              of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are key
              drivers of disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER represents
              genes as modules with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to study
              lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important genes,
              which lack individual associations, are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
              incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER contextualizes
              genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that may be
              missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the

              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,

              studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a significant role in disease origin and
              progression. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER's representation is
              based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
              the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We
              observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework
              for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene
              modules, highlighting disease etiology and potential therapeutic
              targets.

              In the field of genetic studies and functional genomics,
              understanding how genes influence complex traits is crucial for
              developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a significant role in disease origin and

              We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that

              perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint

              expression regulation across different conditions. This
              understanding is crucial for the development of new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on

              of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are also

              represents genes as modules with similar expression patterns

              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant

            We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
            gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
            common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in
            concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
            functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
            requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
            different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's
            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
            patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
            significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
            cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
            drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
            using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
            functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
            in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by
            incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
            contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
            missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel
            framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of
            gene modules.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions. To understand how these genes influence complex traits,
              it is crucial to have a mechanistic understanding of how gene
              expression is regulated under different conditions. This
              understanding is essential for the development of new therapies.
              Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules that are expressed in relevant cell types. Our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and provides
              insights into the mechanisms of action. Additionally, we used a
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that
              functionally important players, although lacking associations, are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, by considering groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and
              identify potential targets that may be missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

            Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
            their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex
            traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
            across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study
            show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
            expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
            predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
            action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
            regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
            associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
            PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
            genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
            potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER
            provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions. To understand how these genes influence complex traits,
              it is crucial to have a mechanistic understanding of how gene
              expression is regulated under different conditions. This
              understanding is essential for the development of new therapies.
              Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules that are expressed in relevant cell types. Our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and provides
              insights into the mechanisms of action. Additionally, we used a
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that
              functionally important players, although lacking associations, are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, by considering groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and
              identify potential targets that may be missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting
              genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

            Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
            their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex
            traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation

            critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study
            show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
            expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
            predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
            action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
            regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
            associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
            PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed
            genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions. To understand how these genes influence complex traits,
              it is crucial to have a mechanistic understanding of how gene
              expression is regulated under different conditions. This
              understanding is essential for the development of new therapies.
              Our study demonstrates that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules that are expressed in relevant cell types. Our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and provides
              insights into the mechanisms of action. Additionally, we used a
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and found that
              functionally important players, although lacking associations, are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In
              conclusion, by considering groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and
              identify potential targets that may be missed by single-gene
              strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting

              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the

              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions. To understand how these genes influence complex traits,
              it is important to have a mechanistic understanding of how gene
              expression is regulated under different conditions. This
              understanding is crucial for the development of new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, it is now
              recognized that gene-gene interactions play a key role in the
              origin and progression of complex traits. In this study, we
              present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we discover that
              functionally important genes, which lack individual associations,
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been

              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the

              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their

              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we discover that
              functionally important genes, which lack individual associations,
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

            Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
            their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex
            traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
            across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
            the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
            associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
            our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
            to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions. To understand how these genes influence complex traits,
              it is important to have a mechanistic understanding of how gene
              expression is regulated under different conditions. This
              understanding is crucial for the development of new therapies.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover
              the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, it is now
              recognized that gene-gene interactions play a key role in the
              origin and progression of complex traits. In this study, we
              present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally,
              using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we discover that
              functionally important genes, which lack individual associations,
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure

              in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely
              necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the
              abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must
              communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first
              sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
              which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is
              narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
              answered. A successful context section sets the stage for
              distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of
              the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e.,
              the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection
              between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper
              opened with); 2) The content ("Here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then
              you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3)
              Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the
              question that was posed at the end of the context section. There
              is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights
              how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e.,
              "broader significance").
