Determining gene-associated disease etiology and drug mechanisms requires a deep comprehension of expression regulation across various conditions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in disease-relevant processes; however, modern architectural models predict that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of complex traits. Introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations, pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation, allows for joint analysis. This representation is built upon modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results showcase that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER exhibits high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. By leveraging a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we uncover the presence of functionally important players lacking associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, through incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and highlights potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

 We present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach, which aims to bridge the gap between genetic studies and pharmacological perturbation data. This innovative method enables a joint analysis by mapping gene-trait associations into a shared latent representation. It is essential to understand how genes collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions, and determining the impact of these interactions on complex traits requires a deep comprehension of the regulation of gene expression across diverse conditions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in revealing individual genes' role in disease mechanisms; however, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in the development and progression of diseases. PhenoPLIER is based on modules of co-expressed genes with similar expression patterns under identical conditions, as opposed to solely focusing on single-genes. We have observed significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and identifies the mechanisms of action. By analyzing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we uncover essential players that are functionally important but lack direct genetic association connections, yet can be prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, this framework incorporating groups of co-expressed genes allows for contextualizing genetic associations, thus revealing potential targets that may not have been captured through single-gene strategies. By using PhenoPLIER, we introduce a novel method to interpret and leverage genetic associations through the lens of gene modules and their complex interactions in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.">[FAIL] (0.91) Python code returned false

 The paper introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. In the broader context of understanding complex traits and disease etiology, there is a gap in the literature regarding how gene interactions contribute to these processes. Existing transcriptome-wide association studies have primarily focused on single genes' roles in disease mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial for understanding complex trait architectures. Addressing this issue, PhenoPLIER represents genetic associations based on modules of co-expressed genes across specific conditions. The approach demonstrates significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms. It also highlights the importance of functionally important players missed by single-gene strategies but prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules. The conclusion emphasizes that PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations through gene co-expression, revealing previously overlooked potential targets for drug repurposing and therapeutic development.">[FAIL] (0.82) Expected output to contain "CRISPR"

Ultimately, PhenoPLIER utilizes groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and identify potential targets previously overlooked by single-gene strategies. Through this novel framework, PhenoPLIER enables a comprehensive examination of genetic associations via gene modules, thereby enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.</td>

To address these limitations, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that utilizes modules based on genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions to analyze genetic associations with diseases, pharmacological perturbations, and infer drug mechanisms. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, disease-associated gene modules, and functionally important players without significant prior connections but prioritized by PhenoPLIER within trait-related modules through CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation.</td>

 Genes often collaborate with one another in specific contexts to execute their functions, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of how these genes contribute to complex traits. The elucidation of this relationship is crucial for devising new therapies and targeting disease mechanisms. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in disease-relevant processes. Modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in the development and progression of complex traits. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that merges gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation utilizes modules consisting of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly connected to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and that PhenoPLIER is adept at predicting known drug-disease associations as well as uncovering their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through a CRISPR screen studying lipid regulation, we find that functionally critical players may lack direct associations but can be prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER due to shared expression patterns across relevant conditions.">[FAIL] (0.91) Python code returned false
