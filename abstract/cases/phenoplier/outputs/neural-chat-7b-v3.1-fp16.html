To elucidate how these genes contribute to complex traits, it is essential to understand the regulation of gene expression across different conditions. This understanding plays a critical role in developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have demonstrated the importance of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms, modern architectural models for complex traits emphasize the significance of gene-gene interactions in shaping diseases. In this work, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that utilizes a common latent representation derived from gene expression patterns across different conditions and conditions. This framework unifies gene-trait associations, pharmacological perturbation data, and modules of co-expressed genes. By analyzing diseases' significant associations with relevant gene expression modules, PhenoPLIER exhibits accurate predictions of known drug-disease pairs and the mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen examining lipid regulation reveals that functionally important players are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER despite lacking direct associations. Overall, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of gene expression patterns provides a novel approach for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, which can potentially uncover missed targets and contribute to drug repurposing strategies in therapeutic development.">[PASS] (1.00)  Genes collaborate to perform their functions in specific contexts.

 Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions, which greatly influences the development of complex traits. However, understanding how these genes impact disease progression requires insight into gene expression regulation under different conditions. Existing transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable information on individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms, but the role of gene-gene interactions in complex trait development is still not fully understood. Here we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that links gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. It identifies modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions to provide a contextual understanding of genetic associations. By doing so, PhenoPLIER successfully associates diseases with gene expression patterns in relevant cell types, accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action, as well as prioritizes functionally important genes that lack direct associations but are present in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, potentially revealing overlooked therapeutic targets and enhancing our understanding of disease mechanisms.">[FAIL] (0.91) Expected output to contain "CRISPR"

 We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach for analyzing genetic associations and drug mechanisms by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation. Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions; understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates an insight into expression regulation across different conditions. This knowledge is vital for developing new therapies, particularly for complex diseases with multifactorial origins and progression. Transcriptome-wide association studies have significantly contributed to unraveling the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, but modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial in shaping these processes.

PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions. We observe that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and demonstrate high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs as well as understanding mechanisms of action. Furthermore, applying a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we find that important players lacking direct associations with traits were prioritized by PhenoPLIER due to their membership in trait-associated gene modules.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER leverages the concept of co-expressed genes to provide a unique perspective on genetic associations and reveals potential targets that could be missed using single-gene strategies.

 Introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. Genes collaborate intricately to execute their functions, necessitating an understanding of their role in influencing complex traits through expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is crucial for developing new therapies and uncovering disease mechanisms. Transcriptome-wide association studies have enabled the discovery of individual genes' roles in disease-related mechanisms. However, modern models of complex trait architecture highlight the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease initiation and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on groups of genes with similar expression patterns across specific conditions, termed "gene modules." We observe that diseases are significantly related to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and reveals the mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we find that functionally significant players lack individual associations but are prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER.

 We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. Genes function together in specific contexts to execute their tasks, necessitating understanding of how these genes influence complex traits by exploring the regulation of gene expression across various conditions. Such insights are crucial for developing new therapies, particularly considering that recent models suggest gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease onset and progression. Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in discovering individual genes' roles in disease-related mechanisms, but they alone don't account for the impact of gene-gene interactions. PhenoPLIER is based on modules consisting of co-expressed genes under similar conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly linked to these gene modules relevant to specific cell types and can predict drug-disease associations effectively, along with inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, employing a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we find functionally critical players not associated with traits but prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-related modules.

In conclusion, integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER enables contextualizing genetic associations and helps identify potential targets that may be missed through single-gene strategies. This novel framework provides a powerful tool for interpreting genetic associations via gene module analysis, thus advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.">[FAIL] (0.73) Python code returned false

 This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for analysis. The approach focuses on gene expression patterns across different conditions to better understand complex traits and their influence on diseases. Traditional transcriptome studies have mainly focused on individual genes; however, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play significant roles in disease etiology. By representing genes based on their expression patterns under similar conditions, PhenoPLIER shows that diseases are associated with modules of co-expressed genes relevant to the affected tissues. Through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, functionally important players that lack single-gene associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers an innovative framework for understanding genetic associations through groups of co-expressed genes and reveals potential targets that might otherwise be missed by single-gene approaches.">[FAIL] (0.91) Python code returned false
