A mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across varying conditions is essential to discern how these genes influence complex traits. This knowledge is vital for the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important genes lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the perspective of gene modules.">[PASS] (1.00) Genes operate in concert within specific contexts to execute their functions.

It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for combined analysis. Genes function synergistically within specific contexts, and understanding their influence on complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation under varying conditions. This knowledge is vital for the development of new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in elucidating the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We find that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation reveals that functionally significant players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER, by incorporating clusters of co-expressed genes, can contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a unique framework for interpreting genetic associations through the perspective of gene modules.</td>

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a significant advancement in interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, highlighting potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. This approach could revolutionize the understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, thereby advancing the broader field of genetic studies.</td>

Additionally, through a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a significant advancement in interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, highlighting potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. This approach could revolutionize the understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, thereby advancing the broader field of genetic studies.</td>

Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to perform their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across varying conditions is essential to understand how these genes impact complex traits. This understanding is vital for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that interactions between genes are pivotal in disease onset and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for combined analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.

Genes function synergistically within specific contexts to perform their roles. A mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across varying conditions is essential to understand how these genes impact complex traits. This understanding is vital for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in revealing the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that interactions between genes are pivotal in disease onset and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for combined analysis. This representation is founded on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions. We found that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally significant players, although lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.</td>

PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation demonstrated that functionally important players, although lacking direct associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings not only answer the question of gene-gene interaction's role in disease progression but also highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER as a tool for identifying therapeutic targets and advancing drug repurposing efforts, thereby pushing the boundaries of functional genomics.">[PASS] (1.00) The functional genomics field has made significant strides in understanding how individual genes influence complex traits and disease mechanisms, primarily through transcriptome-wide association studies.
