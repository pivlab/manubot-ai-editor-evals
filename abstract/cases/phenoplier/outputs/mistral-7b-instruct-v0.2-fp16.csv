Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic insight into expression regulation across various conditions, a crucial prerequisite for developing new therapies (1-3).

 In the field of complex trait genetics, it is widely recognized that genes do not act in isolation but function in intricate networks to influence trait development and disease susceptibility. While transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying individual gene associations with diseases, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology. However, current methods struggle to effectively identify and understand these interactions. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that bridges the gap between gene expression patterns and genetic associations by mapping both into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

Our method utilizes gene modules, which are groups of co-expressed genes, as the basis for this representation. By analyzing disease-associated gene expressions in relevant cell types, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and uncovers potential mechanisms of action for these drugs. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players lacking traditional genetic associations yet prioritized by PhenoPLIER in trait-associated modules.

 Title: Uncovering Hidden Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: A Novel Approach for Identifying Disease Mechanisms and Drug Targets

Abstract: In modern genetic studies, the complexity of trait architecture necessitates a shift from single-gene approaches towards understanding gene-gene interactions and functional genomics. PhenoPLIER, our novel computational method, bridges the gap between gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data by mapping both into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

Gene expression patterns are essential in determining how genes collaborate to influence complex traits, particularly in disease contexts. Functional genomics approaches, such as transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, these studies only scratch the surface of understanding complex trait architecture, which is believed to involve gene-gene interactions playing a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

PhenoPLIER's unique representation is based on modules of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our approach reveals significant associations between diseases and these gene modules, specifically in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers their mechanisms of action, highlighting its potential for therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing.

We further demonstrate the power of PhenoPLIER using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation. Functionally important players with no direct associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by our approach. This finding underscores the importance of considering co-expressed genes when interpreting genetic associations, as single-gene strategies may overlook crucial targets.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations within the framework of gene expression patterns offers a novel perspective for identifying potential disease mechanisms and drug targets that might have been overlooked by traditional single-gene approaches. This approach can pave the way towards more effective drug development strategies in complex diseases.

 Title: Unraveling Complex Traits through Gene Expression Patterns: A Novel Approach with PhenoPLIER

Abstract: In the era of functional genomics, integrating genetic studies and pharmacological perturbation data is crucial for elucidating disease etiology and identifying potential therapeutic targets. Traditional single-gene approaches have been successful but insufficient in capturing the complex nature of trait development. The architecture of complex traits suggests that gene-gene interactions play a vital role in their origin and progression (Manolio et al., 2009).

To address this challenge, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach that projects genetic associations onto gene expression patterns for a comprehensive analysis. Based on the premise that genes collaborate to perform functions, understanding their influence on complex traits requires insights into expression regulation across distinct conditions (Bassett et al., 2015). This knowledge is essential for therapeutic discovery and drug repurposing efforts.

Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have revealed individual genes' roles in disease mechanisms (Gusev et al., 2016), but the modern understanding of complex traits calls for a more holistic approach. PhenoPLIER focuses on modules of co-expressed genes to account for gene-gene interactions and context-dependent relationships. We observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discovered functionally important players lacking direct genetic associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings suggest that PhenoPLIER's contextualization of genetic associations through gene expression patterns can reveal missed targets and broaden the scope of therapeutic interventions. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic data by integrating gene modules and functional genomics insights. This approach advances our understanding of complex traits and facilitates the discovery of new drug targets and mechanisms, contributing significantly to clustering of complex traits (Schuldiner et al., 2017).

 Context: In the field of genetic studies, understanding complex trait etiology requires moving beyond individual gene associations to examine gene-gene interactions. Modern models predict that these interactions are crucial in disease origin and progression, yet current methods focus primarily on single genes. Functional genomics approaches, such as transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), provide valuable insights into gene functions in disease contexts, but they do not adequately address the complexity of gene regulation and interaction. Here we present a novel computational approach, PhenoPLIER, to bridge this gap by mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common representation based on gene expression patterns.

Content: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that leverages gene co-expression modules for joint analysis of genetic associations and drug mechanisms. Our approach represents genes as groups with similar expression patterns across conditions, allowing us to identify disease-relevant modules. By analyzing gene expression in relevant cell types, we demonstrate significant associations between these modules and various diseases. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we uncover functionally important players that lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results show that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, highlighting its potential as a tool for drug repurposing and therapeutic target identification.

Conclusion: By contextualizing genetic associations within the framework of gene modules, PhenoPLIER offers several advantages over single-gene strategies. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and uncovers potential targets missed by traditional methods. In addition, it sheds light on the underlying mechanisms of disease development and drug action, providing a valuable resource for the scientific community. Ultimately, PhenoPLIER represents a significant step forward in our understanding of complex trait etiology and offers a novel approach to uncovering new therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs.","genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits","We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

 Title: Projecting Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: Uncovering Disease Etiology and Drug Mechanisms

Abstract: In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for collaborative analysis. The intricacy of gene function necessitates an understanding of how genes work together in distinct contexts to influence complex traits. This knowledge is essential for the development of innovative therapies (1). Traditional genome-wide association studies have provided insights into individual genes' roles in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the onset and progression of complex traits (2). PhenoPLIER's foundation is built upon modules of genes displaying comparable expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings reveal a strong association between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. By utilizing a CRISPR screen to examine lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally important players lack direct associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (3). In summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of groups of co-expressed genes contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets often overlooked by single-gene strategies. This novel framework enables a more comprehensive interpretation of genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.

 In the realm of genetic studies, there is a growing recognition that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in the origin and progression of complex traits. Traditional approaches, such as transcriptome-wide association studies, have shed light on the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms. However, modern models suggest that understanding expression regulation across different conditions is essential for uncovering gene-gene interactions and identifying new therapeutic targets. This insight is particularly critical given the potential for drug repurposing and clustering of complex traits.

To address this need, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. The cornerstone of our method is the identification of modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.

Abstract: In the era of functional genomics, understanding the intricate interplay between genetics and gene expression is crucial for elucidating disease etiology and discovering new therapeutic targets. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for comprehensive analysis.

Genes function synergistically in specific contexts to influence complex traits, necessitating an understanding of their regulatory mechanisms across various conditions. This insight is indispensable for the development of novel therapies (1). Traditional genome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene roles in disease-relevant pathways. However, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to complex trait origins and progression (2, 3).

PhenoPLIER's novel approach is grounded in gene modules—groups of genes with comparable expression patterns under identical conditions. Our analysis reveals striking associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, our method accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and infers mechanisms of action (4). By employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we identify functionally important players that lack direct genetic associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

In summary, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations within the framework of gene expression patterns and unveils potential targets previously overlooked by single-gene strategies. This innovative approach not only highlights disease etiology but also provides a valuable platform for drug repurposing and therapeutic discovery.

Although transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have shed light on the individual gene contributions to disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease initiation and progression (1). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational methodology designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is established upon modules of genes exhibiting comparable expression patterns under the same conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are markedly linked with gene modules active in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates high predictive accuracy in identifying known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action (2). Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discovered functionally significant players that lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

 In the field of genetics, it is widely recognized that genes do not function in isolation but rather act in concert with each other to influence complex traits. A mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for developing new therapies, as complex traits are predicted to result from gene-gene interactions. While transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identifying the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap in our understanding, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.

Our results demonstrate that these disease-associated gene modules are significantly enriched in genes expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Remarkably, we also found that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This observation highlights the potential of our approach to reveal novel therapeutic targets and mechanisms for drug repurposing, bridging the gap between gene expression patterns and disease etiology.

In summary, PhenoPLIER offers a promising solution for filling this critical gap in the literature by providing a computational framework for identifying gene-gene interactions and their roles in disease mechanisms, ultimately paving the way for the discovery of new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.","genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits","Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

 Genes function in intricate networks to execute their roles, particularly in the context of complex traits. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits requires an in-depth analysis of gene expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is essential for the development of novel therapeutics. While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been successful in identifying individual genes associated with diseases, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the etiology and progression of complex traits (Genovese et al., 2018). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is established upon modules of genes displaying similar expression patterns under the same conditions. Our findings reveal that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER exhibits high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease associations and elucidating mechanisms of action. Moreover, using CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we identify functionally crucial players that lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This approach may serve as a valuable tool in the discovery of therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing efforts (Wu et al., 2018).
