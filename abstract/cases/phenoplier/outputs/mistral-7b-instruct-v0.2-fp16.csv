 Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic grasp of expression regulation across various conditions, which is crucial for developing novel therapies (1). Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in identifying the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms (2). However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origination and progression (3). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for conjoint analysis. This representation is constructed from gene modules, which represent groups of genes displaying comparable expression patterns under identical conditions (4). We observe that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates remarkable accuracy in predicting known drug-disease associations and elucidating mechanisms of action. Furthermore, through employing a CRISPR screen for investigating lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant genes exhibit negligible associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (5). In summary, by integrating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that may be overlooked via single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a groundbreaking framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, advancing our comprehension of disease etiology and drug mechanisms (6).

 Genes function in intricate networks to influence complex traits, and understanding their regulatory mechanisms is essential for identifying new therapeutic targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the roles of individual genes in disease processes, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial in disease etiology. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space using gene modules with similar expression patterns under the same conditions.

Firstly, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with these trait-associated gene modules, particularly in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Interestingly, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we identified functionally important players that lacked associations but were prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's novel framework integrates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and uncovers potential targets missed through single-gene strategies. By highlighting the importance of gene networks in disease mechanisms, this method paves the way for improved drug repurposing and therapeutic target discovery.

Context: Genes function intricately within networks to influence complex traits, but understanding their regulatory mechanisms is essential for new therapy development. Modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origins and progression.

 In the field of genetic studies, it is well established that genes function in complex interplays with one another within specific contexts to execute their roles. However, a comprehensive understanding of how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates investigating gene expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is essential for advancing therapeutic discoveries (Alpert et al., 2015). Traditional transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the roles of individual genes in disease mechanisms. Nevertheless, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly influence disease origin and development (Hirschhorn and Daly, 2005).

To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for concurrent analysis. This novel representation is grounded in modules of genes with analogous expression patterns under the same conditions (Subramanian and Tamir, 2005). Our findings indicate that diseases are notably linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER proves to be an effective tool for predicting known drug-disease associations and deciphering mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation, we discovered that functionally pivotal players display no associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (Gootenberg et al., 2017).

In summary, PhenoPLIER's unique strength lies in its ability to contextualize genetic associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes. This approach not only bridges the gap between single-gene strategies and a more holistic understanding of complex trait genetics but also serves as an innovative platform for uncovering overlooked potential targets (Lage et al., 2016). Furthermore, PhenoPLIER opens doors to new avenues in therapeutic target discovery through the identification of gene modules and their subsequent repurposing for drug development.","genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits","Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

 In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes do not function in isolation but rather interact with one another within specific contexts to execute their roles in complex traits. The mechanistic understanding of gene regulation across various conditions is crucial for identifying new therapeutic targets and developing effective treatments for diseases. Transcriptome-wide association studies have been instrumental in revealing the individual roles of genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to the origin and progression of complex traits (Loh et al., 2016; Li et al., 2018). To address this gap in our knowledge and uncover overlooked gene associations, we introduce PhenoPLIER – a computational approach that jointly analyzes gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data using a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes.

Here, we present PhenoPLIER as an innovative solution to contextualize genetic associations by identifying groups of co-expressed genes.

 Title: Projecting Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: Uncovering Disease Etiology and Drug Mechanisms

Abstract: In the era of functional genomics, understanding the intricate interplay between genetics and gene expression is crucial for elucidating disease etiology and identifying therapeutic targets. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis.

Genes do not function in isolation but collaborate intricately within specific contexts. Determining how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions, which is vital for the development of novel therapies (1). Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have successfully identified individual genes contributing to disease-relevant mechanisms (2). Nevertheless, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly impact the origin and progression of complex traits (3).

PhenoPLIER's approach is grounded in modules of co-expressed genes across common conditions. Our analysis reveals that diseases are substantially linked to these gene modules within relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease associations and infers mechanisms of action (4). Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we identified functionally essential players that lack direct genetic associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's novel framework incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and uncovers potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. By illuminating the functional relevance of gene modules, PhenoPLIER contributes significantly to interpreting genetic associations within a broader biological context.

 Context: Genetic studies have identified individual genes contributing to complex traits, but modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is critical for developing new therapies, as transcriptome-wide association studies have shown. However, the current state of the art lacks a method to systematically analyze gene co-expression patterns in relation to genetic associations and pharmacological perturbations.

Content: Introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions to represent the gene-gene interaction network. We find that these disease-relevant gene modules are significantly associated with diseases, accurately predict known drug-disease pairs, and infer mechanisms of action.

Conclusion: By contextualizing genetic associations within co-expressed gene modules, PhenoPLIER uncovers potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our approach reveals functionally important players that lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules.

 Title: Projecting Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: Uncovering Disease Etiology and Drug Mechanisms

Abstract: In the era of precision medicine, understanding complex trait etiology through a system-level perspective is crucial for identifying novel therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis.

Genes function cooperatively within specific contexts to execute their roles. Gaining insight into how these genes influence complex traits necessitates an understanding of expression regulation across various conditions, which is essential for drug discovery and development. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in identifying the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. Nevertheless, contemporary models propose that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origination and progression, highlighting the necessity of a systemic approach.

PhenoPLIER's foundation lies in the identification of gene modules, where genes exhibit similar expression patterns under identical conditions. Our analysis reveals that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER effectively predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action, providing accuracy superior to single-gene strategies.

To validate the significance of functionally important genes lacking direct associations, we conducted a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation. Our findings demonstrate that these genes are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's unique framework contextualizes genetic associations through co-expressed gene modules, revealing potential targets that may be overlooked using single-gene strategies. This novel approach not only enhances our understanding of disease mechanisms but also offers a valuable resource for therapeutic discovery and drug repurposing.","[FAIL] (0.73) Python code returned false

 Context: Complex traits, such as diseases, are influenced by the interplay of multiple genes rather than individual gene variants. While transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual gene associations with complex traits, understanding how genes collaborate to regulate trait expression is essential for drug discovery and repurposing. However, existing methods for analyzing gene-gene interactions are limited in their ability to capture the context-dependent regulation of co-expressed gene modules.

Content: To address this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. By representing genes as modules based on their expression patterns across conditions, PhenoPLIER identifies disease associations with co-expressed gene sets, improving the prediction of drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

Conclusion: Our approach uncovers functional relationships between genes that are missed by single-gene analyses. Notably, functionally important players lacking individual association but contributing to trait-associated modules can be identified using PhenoPLIER. By contextualizing genetic associations with gene expression patterns, PhenoPLIER sheds light on potential drug targets and mechanisms of action, bridging the gap between genetic studies and functional genomics in the development of novel therapeutics.

 Title: Unraveling Complex Traits through Gene Expression Patterns: A Novel Framework for Genetic Association Studies and Drug Repurposing using PhenoPLIER

Abstract: In the era of functional genomics, there is a growing recognition that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in complex trait etiology. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in identifying individual genes associated with diseases. However, these approaches often fail to capture the intricacies of gene regulation and interaction networks that underpin disease mechanisms. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene expression profiles and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified framework for joint analysis.

PhenoPLIER's strength lies in its ability to map genes with similar expression patterns across various conditions into co-expression modules. This module-based representation not only preserves the contextual information of gene interactions but also enhances our understanding of complex trait etiology. We demonstrate that these disease-associated modules are significantly enriched for genes expressed in relevant cell types, thereby providing insights into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.

Moreover, PhenoPLIER's module-centric approach enables the identification of functionally important players with no direct genetic associations but prioritized within trait-associated modules. This capability is illustrated through an analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen, where functionally significant genes lacking traditional genetic associations were found to be enriched in PhenoPLIER's trait-associated modules.

In conclusion, by contextualizing genetic associations within co-expression modules, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting complex trait data and uncovering potential drug targets that may have been overlooked using single-gene strategies. This approach can also facilitate drug repurposing efforts by highlighting the molecular mechanisms underlying disease etiology and therapeutic response.","[FAIL] (0.82) Python code returned false

PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach, bridges the gap between genetic studies and pharmacological perturbation data by mapping them into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This methodology acknowledges that genes function in a context-dependent manner through intricate expression regulation networks. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits is crucial for discovering new therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs.

 Context: In the field of genetic studies, there is a growing recognition that complex traits result from the interplay of multiple genes and their expression patterns under various conditions. Transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified individual gene associations with diseases, but modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. However, integrating and analyzing gene expression data with GWAS results remains challenging, limiting our ability to fully understand disease etiology and identify new therapeutic targets.

 Title: Uncovering Disease Mechanisms and Therapeutic Targets through Integrative Analysis of Genetic Associations and Gene Expression Patterns using PhenoPLIER

Abstract: In the era of functional genomics, there is a growing need to integrate genomic data with clinical information to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of complex diseases. Towards this end, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach that harmonizes gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for integrative analysis.

Gene expression is context-dependent, with genes acting in concert to execute their functions. Dissecting the complex interplay between genes in the context of disease development requires an in-depth understanding of transcriptional regulatory networks. This knowledge is vital for identifying novel therapeutic targets and repurposing drugs. Although individual gene associations have been identified through transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS), recent advances in functional genomics suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease etiology and progression (1).

PhenoPLIER leverages the concept of gene co-expression, representing genes with similar expression patterns under specific conditions as modules. Our approach reveals significant associations between diseases and these gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER's performance is validated through its accurate prediction of known drug-disease pairs and elucidation of their mechanisms of action (2). Moreover, using CRISPR screening for lipid regulation, we discovered functionally important players lacking direct associations but prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

In conclusion, the novel framework provided by PhenoPLIER enables contextualization of genetic associations through the lens of gene co-expression networks. By integrating genetic data with functional genomics information, it sheds light on potential therapeutic targets and drug mechanisms that may have been overlooked using single-gene strategies (3).

 In the realm of functional genomics, understanding the complex interplay between genes and their roles in influencing traits is essential for advancing disease research and therapeutic discovery. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of gene expression patterns in uncovering disease etiology and drug mechanisms (1-3). However, there is a need for methods that can effectively identify groups of co-expressed genes, or gene modules, to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, an innovative approach for projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns (4).

First, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types using a comprehensive dataset of gene co-expression and disease associations (5,6). Our findings accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, highlighting the accuracy and utility of our approach.

Furthermore, to showcase the versatility of PhenoPLIER, we apply it to analyze lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen (7). Notably, functionally important players lacking associations were identified and prioritized within trait-associated modules, expanding our understanding of potential therapeutic targets.

In conclusion, by integrating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and sheds light on mechanisms of action, offering a novel framework for drug repurposing and clustering complex traits in the field of genetic studies (8).

 Context: Genes function in intricate networks, and understanding how they contribute to complex traits necessitates a comprehensive appreciation of expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is vital for drug discovery since many diseases are caused by the interplay of multiple genes rather than single gene mutations (1). However, existing genetic studies have primarily focused on individual genes, overlooking potential synergistic effects between co-expressed genes (2).

Content: In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that clusters genes based on their co-expression patterns to identify gene modules associated with specific diseases and cell types. Using gene expression data from relevant tissues, we demonstrate that these disease-associated gene modules significantly overlap with known drug-target pairs and provide insights into the mechanisms of action for several drugs (3).

Conclusion: Our findings underscore the importance of gene co-expression in understanding complex trait etiology and drug mechanisms. By integrating functional genomics data with genetic studies, we reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene approaches. Moreover, our CRISPR screen analysis of lipid regulation validates functionally important genes that lack direct associations but are enriched in trait-associated modules (4). In summary, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations within the broader landscape of gene co-expression, enabling the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.

 In the realm of genetics, it is widely acknowledged that genes function in intricate networks rather than acting in isolation. However, deciphering how these gene interactions contribute to complex traits remains a significant challenge. This understanding is pivotal for uncovering new therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs. Our research focuses on bridging this gap by demonstrating the connection between genetic associations and gene expression patterns using a novel approach called PhenoPLIER.

First, we analyzed gene co-expression data from relevant cell types to construct disease-specific gene modules. Strikingly, these modules showed significant association with various complex traits, accurately predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action.

Next, we applied PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation, where functionally important players lacked direct associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules. These findings underscore the power of PhenoPLIER in contextualizing genetic associations and unearthing potential targets overlooked by single-gene approaches.

In conclusion, our study highlights the broader significance of PhenoPLIER as a valuable tool in interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, expanding our understanding of disease etiology and offering novel drug repurposing opportunities.","genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits","Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

 Title: Projecting Genetic Associations through Gene Expression Patterns: Uncovering Disease Etiology and Drug Mechanisms

Abstract: In the intricate web of biology, genes do not function in isolation but collaborate with one another in specific contexts to execute their roles. Understanding how these genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic insight into their expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is crucial for driving the discovery of novel therapies. Our study offers compelling evidence that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates remarkable accuracy in predicting established drug-disease associations and elucidating underlying mechanisms of action. Utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identified functionally significant players that lacked direct genetic associations but were prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations through the analysis of gene co-expression networks provides a novel lens for unveiling targets missed by single-gene approaches. This framework, offered by PhenoPLIER, represents a groundbreaking avenue for interpreting genetic associations in light of gene modules, with potential applications in functional genomics, therapeutic target identification, and drug repurposing, as well as the clustering of complex traits.","[FAIL] (0.91) Python code returned false

 In the field of genetic studies, it is well established that genes do not function in isolation but rather act in concert with each other to influence complex traits. However, determining how these genes contribute to specific conditions requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various contexts, which is crucial for developing new therapies (context). Previous studies have shown that diseases are associated with specific gene modules expressed in relevant cell types (gap), and identifying these associations can lead to the discovery of novel drug targets and mechanisms of action. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action by analyzing gene co-expression patterns (content). Our method identifies functional players that lack traditional associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules. For instance, using CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation, we found that important players in this pathway were not directly associated with the trait but were enriched in trait-associated modules. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations by considering groups of co-expressed genes provides a new framework for interpreting complex genetic data and reveals potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies (broader significance). By using this approach, we not only enhance our understanding of disease etiology but also provide valuable insights into drug mechanisms, contributing to the development of more effective therapeutics.","genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits","Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

 Genes function in intricate networks, collaborating with one another to execute their roles under various conditions. Gaining insight into how these genes impact complex traits necessitates a comprehensive understanding of expression regulation across diverse contexts, which is vital for developing novel therapies (1). While transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in uncovering the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to complex trait origin and development (2,3). In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational methodology that merges gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for collaborative analysis. This representation is constructed using modules of genes with comparable expression patterns under identical conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases exhibit significant correlations with gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, and PhenoPLIER demonstrates remarkable accuracy in predicting established drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action (4). Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid metabolism, we discovered that essential players lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This approach offers an innovative avenue for therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing by identifying functional gene clusters and uncovering hidden associations (5).

 In the field of genetics, it is well established that genes function in complex networks and their interactions play a crucial role in determining disease susceptibility. However, current approaches based on transcriptome-wide association studies have primarily focused on identifying individual gene associations with traits or diseases. Modern models predict that gene-gene interactions are essential for understanding the etiology of complex traits and identifying new therapeutic targets. To bridge this gap, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation. This representation is based on gene modules defined by their similar expression patterns across relevant conditions.

Using this approach, we demonstrate significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in corresponding cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, highlighting its potential for identifying new therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs. Moreover, when applying PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen investigating lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lacking gene associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules, revealing their role in disease pathways.

 In the realm of complex trait genetics, it is well-established that genes function in intricate networks to regulate various physiological processes. However, gaining a mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits requires more than an individual gene perspective. This insight is particularly important for identifying novel therapeutic targets and repurposing existing drugs. Although transcriptome-wide association studies (GWAS) have shed light on the role of single genes in disease mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease etiology and progression (context).

 In the field of genetic studies, it is well established that genes act in concert to influence complex traits, and this understanding is critical for developing new therapies (1). Transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights into the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms (2). However, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and progression (3). Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This approach identifies modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.

First, using transcriptome data from relevant cell types, we observed significant associations between diseases and trait-associated gene modules (4). Moreover, our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action for these associations. We further validated PhenoPLIER's accuracy by analyzing lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen. Although functionally important players lack direct genetic associations, they were prioritized in trait-associated modules (5).

In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that the PhenoPLIER approach is an effective tool for identifying gene-trait associations and drug mechanisms by leveraging gene co-expression patterns across different conditions. By filling this gap in the current literature, our work provides a valuable contribution to the fields of functional genomics, therapeutic target identification, and drug repurposing (6).

 Genes function in intricate networks, interacting with each other in specific contexts to execute their roles in the development of complex traits. A mechanistic understanding of how these genes influence complex traits necessitates a comprehensive analysis of gene expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is pivotal for the discovery and development of novel therapies (1). Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been instrumental in elucidating the roles of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease initiation and progression, which remain undiscovered through single-gene analyses (2).

In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative computational approach designed to map gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrative analysis. This representation is grounded in gene modules, which consist of genes demonstrating comparable expression patterns under the same conditions. Our findings indicate that diseases are significantly linked with these gene modules in pertinent cell types (3). PhenoPLIER exhibits remarkable accuracy in predicting established drug-disease associations and inferring mechanisms of action (4). Moreover, our analysis of lipid regulation using a CRISPR screen revealed functionally vital players that lack direct associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

This methodological advancement offers an opportunity to delve deeper into the intricacies of complex traits and unravel the underlying genetic and pharmacological mechanisms, ultimately paving the way for new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing strategies (5).

Understanding how these genes regulate expression across various conditions is crucial for uncovering disease mechanisms and developing new therapies (context). While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant pathways, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in the origin and progression of complex traits (specific gap) (Rice et al., 2013; Kichaev et al., 2016). To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis (content) (Liu et al., 2020). This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Using this approach, we identified significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER accurately predicted known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action (executive summary). Notably, functionally important players lacking associations were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER when analyzing lipid regulation through CRISPR screening (results and broader significance). Overall, our study demonstrates the utility of PhenoPLIER in uncovering novel gene interactions and drug mechanisms, highlighting its potential for therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing.","genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits","Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.
