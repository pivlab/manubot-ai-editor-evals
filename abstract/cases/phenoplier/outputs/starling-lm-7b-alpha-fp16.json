Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " Genes collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits necessitates examining expression regulation across various conditions. This insight is crucial for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the roles of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease initiation and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets missed by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is base on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating, groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal, potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

This knowledge is vital for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped elucidate the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.

Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis.

Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped elucidate the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms; however, contemporary models of the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions are vital to disease onset and progression. We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis.

Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.

In summary, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, revealing potential targets that may be missed by single-gene approaches.

          "output": " In the field of functional genomics, understanding gene expression patterns is crucial for decoding the molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases. While individual genes have been linked to specific conditions through transcriptome-wide association studies, the role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology remains largely unresolved. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions. We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, while also prioritizing functionally important players in trait-associated modules that are otherwise missed by single-gene strategies. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene co-expression, enabling the identification of potential therapeutic targets and elucidating drug mechanisms beyond single genes."

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme.

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section.

          "output": " We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent space for comprehensive analysis. Genes collaborate with one another in specific circumstances to perform their functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates an examination of expression regulation across diverse conditions. This knowledge is essential for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on groups of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We discover that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally significant elements lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and identifies potential targets missed by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby shedding light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nIn this revised abstract, we have introduced PhenoPLIER as a computational method instead of just a computational approach. We also emphasized that understanding how genes influence complex traits requires an examination of expression regulation across diverse conditions, which is crucial for the development of novel therapies. Furthermore, we rephrased the sentences to better convey the significance of gene-gene interactions in disease onset and progression. Lastly, we replaced \"we find\" with \"we discover\" to enhance clarity and coherence in the text."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Genes collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions; understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates insights into expression regulation across various conditions. This comprehension is critical for the development of novel therapeutics. Transcriptome-wide association studies have unveiled the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture postulate that gene-gene interactions significantly contribute to disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is built on groups of genes with similar expression patterns across identical conditions. We find that diseases are strongly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER offers a novel perspective for interpreting genetic associations via the lens of gene modules."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

In conclusion, by incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER can provide context for genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.

          "output": " We present PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological intervention data into a shared latent representation for comprehensive analysis. Genes often collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of expression across varying conditions, which is crucial for advancing novel therapeutic approaches. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual genes' roles in disease-related mechanisms, contemporary models suggest that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease initiation and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation relies on gene modules with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation, we discover that functionally crucial players lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide context to genetic associations and identify potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby illuminating disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nKeywords: genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits."

          "output": " In the field of genetic studies, understanding gene expression patterns is crucial for disease etiology and drug mechanism investigations. While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered individual gene roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap in the literature, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This novel method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, allowing for the identification of diseases significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework provides a new perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, ultimately advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms."

Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          "output": " The study of genetic associations and gene expression patterns has been instrumental in understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms. However, current methods primarily focus on single-gene strategies, which may overlook potential targets and mechanisms. This paper aims to address this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. The method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, which are significantly associated with diseases in relevant cell types. We demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation shows that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": " Genes collaborate in specific contexts to execute their functions, necessitating a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across various conditions. This knowledge is crucial for the development of novel therapies. Our study reveals that gene modules expressed in relevant cell types are significantly associated with diseases and accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER's incorporation of co-expressed gene groups contextualizes genetic associations and identifies potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER presents a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, enabling more effective functional genomics research, disease etiology understanding, and drug mechanism elucidation.\n\nIn this revised abstract, we have emphasized the significance of understanding gene expression regulation across different conditions, especially in the context of developing new therapies. Additionally, we have highlighted the use of CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation and how PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important players within trait-associated modules. The revised abstract also underscores the novelty of PhenoPLIER's framework for interpreting genetic associations through gene modules, which can lead to more effective functional genomics research, disease etiology understanding, and drug mechanism elucidation."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": " The field of genetic studies has long sought to understand the complex interplay between genes and their expression in different contexts, particularly in relation to disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Current approaches often rely on single-gene strategies, which can overlook potential targets and mechanisms. In this study, we aimed to address this gap by proposing a novel method called PhenoPLIER that incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to better contextualize genetic associations. Through our analysis of gene modules in relevant cell types, we demonstrated that diseases are significantly associated with these modules, and our approach accurately predicted known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, providing valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms that may have been missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nBy incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of gene expression patterns in relation to disease etiology and drug mechanisms, highlighting the importance of functional genomics in the field of genetic studies. The results of our study demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, making it a valuable tool for researchers seeking to develop new therapies."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " In the field of genetic studies, understanding how genes collaborate in specific contexts to perform their functions is crucial for developing new therapies. However, determining the influence of these genes on complex traits requires a comprehensive approach to gene expression regulation across various conditions. Our study aims to address this gap by examining the associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Through our novel method, PhenoPLIER, we accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. We further demonstrate that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation. In conclusion, incorporating groups of co-expressed genes through PhenoPLIER allows for the contextualization of genetic associations and identifies potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. As a result, PhenoPLIER offers a new framework for interpreting genetic associations in the context of gene modules, significantly advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Our results in this study show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": " In the complex interplay of genes, understanding how they cooperate under different conditions to influence traits is essential for therapy development. Current approaches often overlook this aspect, limiting our ability to uncover disease mechanisms and identify drug targets. This study aims to fill this gap by examining gene co-expression patterns in relation to gene modules associated with diseases and drug mechanisms. Our results demonstrate that the PhenoPLIER approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers action mechanisms, highlighting functionally important players previously unassociated with traits. By incorporating gene co-expression groups, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a powerful tool for deciphering the complex landscape of genetic associations, paving the way for more accurate disease etiology and drug mechanism understanding."

          "output": " Genetic studies have long been crucial in understanding the etiology of diseases and the mechanisms behind drug actions. However, the current literature falls short in comprehensively analyzing gene expression patterns to highlight these disease origins and pharmacological mechanisms. In this context, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions. We demonstrate that our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by analyzing lipid regulation through CRISPR screening, we show that functionally significant players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our approach bridges the gap in genetic studies and provides a powerful tool for uncovering disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nIn conclusion, our study fills a critical gap in the literature by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation. This approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, it highlights the importance of functionally significant players lacking associations in trait-associated modules. By doing so, our work contributes to the broader field of genetic studies by providing insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately advancing therapeutic targets and drug repurposing efforts."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": " Genes collaborate in specific contexts to carry out their functions, and understanding how these genes impact complex traits necessitates an appreciation of expression regulation across diverse conditions. This knowledge is pivotal for the development of novel treatments. Transcriptome-wide association studies have aided in uncovering the roles of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions are essential in the onset and progression of diseases. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that combines gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for integrated analysis. This representation is established on modules of co-expressed genes across similar conditions. Our findings show that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, utilizing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally significant players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nIn the revised paragraph, the original abstract has been rephrased to emphasize the importance of understanding gene interactions and their role in disease development. The introduction of PhenoPLIER as a computational approach for mapping gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation is highlighted. The accuracy of PhenoPLIER's predictions and its ability to prioritize functionally significant players are also emphasized, along with the application of CRISPR screening to analyze lipid regulation."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

Traditionally, transcriptome-wide association studies have focused on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant processes. However, recent models suggest that gene-gene interactions are essential to understanding disease origins and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across conditions. We show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation reveals that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This study highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions to enhance our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, thereby contributing to the development of more effective therapeutic strategies."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

This insight is crucial for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the roles of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms; however, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease initiation and progression. In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets missed by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

This knowledge is vital for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped elucidate the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture propose that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease initiation and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we discover that functionally critical players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of co-expressed genes, contextualizing genetic associations and revealing potential targets missed by single-gene approaches.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

While individual genes have been linked to specific conditions through transcriptome-wide association studies, the role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology remains largely unresolved. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions. We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action, while also prioritizing functionally important players in trait-associated modules that are otherwise missed by single-gene strategies. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene co-expression, enabling the identification of potential therapeutic targets and elucidating drug mechanisms beyond single genes.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Although transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework provides a way to interpret genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, shedding light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nExplanation: \n\n1. Context: The abstract introduces complex traits influenced by multiple genes in specific contexts and emphasizes the importance of understanding gene expression regulation across different conditions for developing new therapies.

Content: The abstract presents PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. It is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, which are significant in disease association with relevant cell types. \n3.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Genes collaborate with one another in specific circumstances to perform their functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits necessitates an examination of expression regulation across diverse conditions. This knowledge is essential for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have elucidated the role of individual genes in disease-related mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on groups of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We discover that diseases are significantly linked to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, employing a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally significant elements lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by incorporating co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and identifies potential targets missed by single-gene approaches. PhenoPLIER offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, thereby shedding light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nIn this revised abstract, we have introduced PhenoPLIER as a computational method instead of just a computational approach. We also emphasized that understanding how genes influence complex traits requires an examination of expression regulation across diverse conditions, which is crucial for the development of novel therapies. Furthermore, we rephrased the sentences to better convey the significance of gene-gene interactions in disease onset and progression.

Current transcriptome-wide association studies have largely focused on single gene associations, overlooking the critical role that gene-gene interactions play in disease origin and progression. This study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, which we find to be significantly associated with diseases in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER demonstrates high accuracy in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we observe that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER's ability to contextualize genetic associations through the lens of gene modules reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies and offers a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations within the complex landscape of gene co-expression and functional genomics.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

However, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our approach is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, observing that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, and using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

However, current transcriptome-wide association studies primarily focus on individual genes, while modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Our method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, which are significantly associated with diseases in relevant cell types. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. As a result, our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, as demonstrated in a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, offering valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered individual gene roles in disease-relevant mechanisms, current models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a significant role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap in the literature, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This novel method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, allowing for the identification of diseases significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel framework provides a new perspective for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, ultimately advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER's representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

However, current methods primarily focus on single-gene strategies, which may overlook potential targets and mechanisms. This paper aims to address this gap by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. The method is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, which are significantly associated with diseases in relevant cell types. We demonstrate the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation shows that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, by incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Current approaches often rely on single-gene strategies, which can overlook potential targets and mechanisms. In this study, we aimed to address this gap by proposing a novel method called PhenoPLIER that incorporates groups of co-expressed genes to better contextualize genetic associations. Through our analysis of gene modules in relevant cell types, we demonstrated that diseases are significantly associated with these modules, and our approach accurately predicted known drug-disease pairs and inferred mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a new framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules, providing valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms that may have been missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nBy incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This novel approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of gene expression patterns in relation to disease etiology and drug mechanisms, highlighting the importance of functional genomics in the field of genetic studies. The results of our study demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action, making it a valuable tool for researchers seeking to develop new therapies.",

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Current approaches often overlook this aspect, limiting our ability to uncover disease mechanisms and identify drug targets. This study aims to fill this gap by examining gene co-expression patterns in relation to gene modules associated with diseases and drug mechanisms. Our results demonstrate that the PhenoPLIER approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers action mechanisms, highlighting functionally important players previously unassociated with traits. By incorporating gene co-expression groups, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a powerful tool for deciphering the complex landscape of genetic associations, paving the way for more accurate disease etiology and drug mechanism understanding.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

However, the current literature falls short in comprehensively analyzing gene expression patterns to highlight these disease origins and pharmacological mechanisms. In this context, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions. We demonstrate that our method accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by analyzing lipid regulation through CRISPR screening, we show that functionally significant players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our approach bridges the gap in genetic studies and provides a powerful tool for uncovering disease etiology and drug mechanisms.\n\nIn conclusion, our study fills a critical gap in the literature by introducing PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation. This approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Additionally, it highlights the importance of functionally significant players lacking associations in trait-associated modules. By doing so, our work contributes to the broader field of genetic studies by providing insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately advancing therapeutic targets and drug repurposing efforts.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

This knowledge has significant implications for developing new therapies. Although transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease mechanisms, modern architectural models of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions are essential in determining disease origin and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER in uncovering disease etiology and drug mechanisms through the analysis of gene expression patterns and co-expression networks.\n\nHere we present a novel computational approach, PhenoPLIER, which maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Traditionally, transcriptome-wide association studies have focused on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant processes. However, recent models suggest that gene-gene interactions are essential to understanding disease origins and progression. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across conditions. We show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and elucidates mechanisms of action. Additionally, a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation reveals that functionally important players lacking associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This study highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions to enhance our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, thereby contributing to the development of more effective therapeutic strategies.",

Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript, so it has a clear sentence structure and follows a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme and fits in a single paragraph. Make changes only when they are absolutely necessary to follow the C-C-C scheme. Under the C-C-C scheme, the abstract must follow the following structure: 1) The context must communicate to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the particular research is situated. Then, this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered. A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper’s contributions from the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with); 2) The content (\"Here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that you used to fill the gap or question. Then you present the meat—your executive summary of the results; 3) Finally, the conclusion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context section. There is often a second part to the conclusion section that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (i.e., \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

            "Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.",
