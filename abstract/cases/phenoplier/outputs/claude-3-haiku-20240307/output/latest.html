Genetic studies have long sought to understand how genes influence complex traits, with the ultimate goal of developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. This gap in the current literature motivates the need for computational approaches that can capture these higher-order genetic effects. (Context)

Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel method that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes, allowing PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by analyzing a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation, we show that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important players that lack individual associations. (Content)

By incorporating information on co-expressed gene modules, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful tool for elucidating the complex genetic architecture of disease and identifying promising therapeutic targets. This advance moves the field of functional genomics closer to realizing the promise of personalized medicine. (Conclusion)

Context: Determining how genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions, which is critical for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. However, current approaches have been limited in their ability to fully capture these complex relationships.

Content: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Conclusion: By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets that may have been missed by single-gene strategies. This approach highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in understanding the etiology of complex traits and identifying novel drug mechanisms.

Here is a revised version of the abstract:

Genetic studies have provided valuable insights into the biological mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases. However, translating these genetic associations into therapeutic targets remains challenging. In this work, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data to uncover disease etiology and potential drug mechanisms. PhenoPLIER maps these diverse data sources into a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions. We observe that disease-associated genes are significantly enriched in modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships while also inferring novel mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by prioritizing functionally important genes that may lack direct genetic associations, PhenoPLIER complements single-gene strategies and provides a more comprehensive view of the underlying biology. 

The key innovations of this work are: 1) the integration of genetic, transcriptomic, and pharmacological data to enable a systems-level understanding of complex traits; 2) the use of gene co-expression modules to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets; and 3) the ability to identify functionally important players that may be missed by traditional approaches focused on individual genes. By leveraging the concerted actions of genes within specific biological contexts, PhenoPLIER offers a promising path for translating genetic discoveries into new therapies.

Here, we present a novel computational approach, PhenoPLIER, that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data to uncover the underlying mechanisms of complex diseases. Existing transcriptome-wide association studies have been limited in their ability to capture the context-dependent, interactive nature of gene expression regulation, which is crucial for understanding the etiology of complex traits. To address this gap, PhenoPLIER maps genetic associations and drug effects onto a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes. Here, we show that this approach accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and reveals potential mechanisms of action. Notably, PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes that lack direct associations but are embedded within trait-associated gene modules. By leveraging the collective behavior of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a more comprehensive and contextual understanding of how genetic variations influence complex phenotypes. This framework can guide the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and facilitate drug repurposing efforts, ultimately advancing our understanding of disease etiology and paving the way for more effective interventions.

Content: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Conclusion: By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of how genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to influence complex traits, which is crucial for developing new therapies.

Here is a revised version of the abstract:

Genetic studies have identified numerous associations between genes and complex traits, but translating these findings into mechanistic insights and therapeutic strategies remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes, which capture the context-dependent functional relationships between genes. 

Our analysis reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to study lipid regulation, we find that functionally important genes often lack direct genetic associations but are prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating information on co-expressed gene modules, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies.

Genes do not act in isolation, but rather function in concert with each other in specific cellular contexts. Determining how these gene-gene interactions influence complex traits is critical for understanding disease etiology and developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have begun to uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene co-expression patterns may provide key insights into the underlying biology.

We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Conclusion: By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach provides a powerful framework to uncover the complex relationships between genes, traits, and therapeutic interventions, advancing our mechanistic understanding of complex diseases.

Here is a revised version of the abstract:

Genetic studies have provided valuable insights into the molecular underpinnings of complex traits and diseases. However, translating these genetic associations into a mechanistic understanding of disease etiology and therapeutic opportunities remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes, which capture the coordinated regulation of genes across diverse biological conditions. 

Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by incorporating information about co-expressed gene modules, PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important players that may lack direct genetic associations but are embedded within trait-associated gene networks. This highlights the importance of considering the context-dependent, systems-level organization of gene expression in interpreting genetic findings and identifying therapeutic targets.

Taken together, this work showcases how integrating genetic associations with functional genomic data can provide a more comprehensive understanding of disease biology and facilitate the repurposing of existing drugs or the discovery of new therapeutic strategies. By leveraging the insights into gene co-expression patterns, PhenoPLIER offers a powerful approach to bridge the gap between genetic discoveries and mechanistic insights that can guide the development of novel interventions.

Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Here is a revised version of the abstract:

Genes often work together in specific biological contexts to carry out their functions. Understanding how these gene interactions influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.

Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting the value of this integrative approach in uncovering the complex genetic architecture of disease and therapeutic response.

Here is the revised abstract following the context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme:

Context: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions, which is critical for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. This highlights the need for computational approaches that can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

Content: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Genes often work together in specific biological contexts to carry out their functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions. Such insights are crucial for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
