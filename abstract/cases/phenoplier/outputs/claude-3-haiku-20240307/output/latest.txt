          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          abstract of this manuscript.

          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across

          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genes work in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
          their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. This insight is critical for developing new
          therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover
          the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
          modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression. 


          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across

          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies.


          The key revisions include:

          - Improving grammar and clarity of phrasing (e.g. "in concierto" ->
          "in concert", "specifico" -> "specific")

          - Removing unnecessary or redundant words (e.g. "It has been shown
          that this insight is critical...")

          - Restructuring sentences for better flow and logical progression of
          ideas

          - Ensuring consistent verb tense (e.g. "have helped" -> "have helped
          uncover")

          - Clarifying technical terms and concepts (e.g. "transcriptome-wide
          association studies", "CRISPR screen")

          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first

          Genetic studies have long sought to understand how genes influence
          complex traits, with the ultimate goal of developing new therapies.
          While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role
          of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of
          complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
          crucial role in disease origin and progression. This gap in the
          current literature motivates the need for computational approaches
          that can capture these higher-order genetic effects. (Context)


          Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel method that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of co-expressed genes, allowing PhenoPLIER to contextualize
          genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. We find that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by analyzing a CRISPR screen on
          lipid regulation, we show that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally
          important players that lack individual associations. (Content)


          By incorporating information on co-expressed gene modules, PhenoPLIER
          provides a powerful tool for elucidating the complex genetic
          architecture of disease and identifying promising therapeutic targets.
          This advance moves the field of functional genomics closer to
          realizing the promise of personalized medicine. (Conclusion)

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          abstract of this manuscript.

          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Here is a revised version of the abstract:


          Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
          their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. This insight is critical for developing new
          therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover
          the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
          modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression. 


          Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our

          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies.


          This work highlights the importance of considering gene expression
          patterns and co-expression modules to understand the genetic basis of
          complex traits and identify novel therapeutic targets.

          Genetic studies have provided valuable insights into the molecular
          underpinnings of complex traits and diseases. However, a comprehensive
          understanding of how genes interact to influence these phenotypes
          remains elusive. (Context) The key challenge lies in bridging the gap
          between genetic associations and the underlying biological mechanisms,
          which is crucial for developing effective therapies. (Context)
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes, but modern models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression.
          (Context)


          (Content) Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes, allowing us
          to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic
          targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. (Content)


          (Conclusion) Our results show that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important
          players that lack individual associations, highlighting its potential
          to advance our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets

          Here is a revised version of the abstract:


          Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions.
          Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions. This insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies.


          The key changes made are:

          1. Correcting grammatical and spelling errors (e.g., "concierto" to
          "together", "specifico" to "specific", "significantl" to
          "significantly").

          2. Simplifying and clarifying the language to improve readability.

          3. Providing more details on the PhenoPLIER approach and its key
          findings.

          4. Emphasizing the importance of considering gene-gene interactions
          and co-expression modules, rather than just individual genes, for
          understanding complex traits and identifying potential therapeutic
          targets.

          (C-C-C) scheme:


          Context: Determining how genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions, which is critical for developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the
          architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
          play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. However,
          current approaches have been limited in their ability to fully capture
          these complex relationships.


          Content: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack individual associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


          Conclusion: By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          therapeutic targets that may have been missed by single-gene
          strategies. This approach highlights the importance of considering
          gene-gene interactions in understanding the etiology of complex traits
          and identifying novel drug mechanisms.

          Here is a revised version of the abstract:


          Genes often act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
          perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex
          traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
          across different conditions. This insight is critical for developing
          new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
          uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.
          However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict
          that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies.


          The key changes made are:

          1. Improved grammar and sentence structure (e.g., "in concierto" ->
          "in concert", "specifico" -> "specific", "significantl" ->
          "significantly").

          2. Clarified the purpose and findings of the study.

          3. Removed redundant phrases (e.g., "It has been shown that this
          insight is critical for developing new therapies").

          4. Emphasized the importance of gene-gene interactions and
          co-expression modules in understanding complex traits and identifying
          potential therapeutic targets.

          Genetic studies have long sought to uncover the complex mechanisms
          underlying common diseases and identify potential therapeutic targets.
          While transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable
          insights into the role of individual genes, modern models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease etiology and
          progression (context). Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis (content). This representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across diverse conditions, allowing
          us to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets

          groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful tool for
          projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns,

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          Revised paragraph:


          Genetic studies have provided valuable insights into the molecular
          underpinnings of complex traits and diseases. However, a comprehensive
          understanding of how genes interact to influence these phenotypes
          remains elusive. (Context) The current literature has primarily
          focused on individual gene-trait associations, overlooking the crucial
          role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression.
          (Context) To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          computational approach that integrates gene expression patterns and
          pharmacological perturbation data to uncover the modular architecture
          of complex traits. (Content) By mapping gene-trait associations and
          drug mechanisms into a shared latent representation, PhenoPLIER
          reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. (Content)
          Furthermore, our approach prioritizes functionally important players
          that lack individual associations, highlighting the power of
          incorporating co-expressed gene modules to contextualize genetic
          findings and identify potential therapeutic targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. (Conclusion) These results demonstrate the
          value of leveraging gene expression patterns to project genetic
          associations and uncover the intricate interplay of genes underlying
          complex phenotypes, paving the way for more targeted and effective
          therapeutic interventions. (Conclusion)

          Here is a revised version of the abstract:


          Genetic studies have provided valuable insights into the biological
          mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases. However,
          translating these genetic associations into therapeutic targets
          remains challenging. In this work, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data to uncover disease etiology and
          potential drug mechanisms. PhenoPLIER maps these diverse data sources
          into a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed
          genes across various conditions. We observe that disease-associated
          genes are significantly enriched in modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
          relationships while also inferring novel mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, by prioritizing functionally important genes that may
          lack direct genetic associations, PhenoPLIER complements single-gene
          strategies and provides a more comprehensive view of the underlying
          biology. 


          The key innovations of this work are: 1) the integration of genetic,
          transcriptomic, and pharmacological data to enable a systems-level
          understanding of complex traits; 2) the use of gene co-expression
          modules to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          therapeutic targets; and 3) the ability to identify functionally
          important players that may be missed by traditional approaches focused
          on individual genes. By leveraging the concerted actions of genes
          within specific biological contexts, PhenoPLIER offers a promising
          path for translating genetic discoveries into new therapies.

          Here, we present a novel computational approach, PhenoPLIER, that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data to uncover the underlying mechanisms of complex diseases.
          Existing transcriptome-wide association studies have been limited in
          their ability to capture the context-dependent, interactive nature of
          gene expression regulation, which is crucial for understanding the
          etiology of complex traits. To address this gap, PhenoPLIER maps
          genetic associations and drug effects onto a common latent
          representation based on modules of co-expressed genes. Here, we show
          that this approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
          relationships and reveals potential mechanisms of action. Notably,
          PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes that lack direct
          associations but are embedded within trait-associated gene modules. By
          leveraging the collective behavior of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          provides a more comprehensive and contextual understanding of how
          genetic variations influence complex phenotypes. This framework can
          guide the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and facilitate drug
          repurposing efforts, ultimately advancing our understanding of disease
          etiology and paving the way for more effective interventions.

          Context: Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover
          the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
          modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions, which is critical for developing new therapies.


          Content: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


          Conclusion: By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. This approach provides a more
          comprehensive understanding of how genes act in concert with each
          other in specific contexts to influence complex traits, which is
          crucial for developing new therapies.

          Here is a revised version of the abstract:


          Genetic studies have identified numerous associations between genes
          and complex traits, but translating these findings into mechanistic
          insights and therapeutic strategies remains a challenge. In this work,
          we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of co-expressed genes, which capture the context-dependent
          functional relationships between genes. 


          Our analysis reveals that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to study
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important genes often lack
          direct genetic associations but are prioritized within
          trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating
          information on co-expressed gene modules, PhenoPLIER can contextualize
          genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets that may
          be missed by single-gene strategies.


          Genes do not act in isolation, but rather function in concert with
          each other in specific cellular contexts. Determining how these
          gene-gene interactions influence complex traits is critical for
          understanding disease etiology and developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have begun to uncover the role
          of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models
          of complex trait architecture suggest that gene co-expression patterns
          may provide key insights into the underlying biology.

          Context: Genetic studies have identified numerous associations between
          genetic variants and complex traits, but elucidating the underlying
          mechanisms remains a major challenge. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have provided insights into the role of individual
          genes, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial
          for understanding disease etiology and progression.

          genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. This
          highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions to

          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint

          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed

          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By

          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed

          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these

          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern

          Here is a revised version of the abstract:


          PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of co-expressed genes across diverse conditions. We find
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using
          a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify functionally
          important players that lack direct genetic associations but are
          prioritized within trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating co-expression patterns, PhenoPLIER can contextualize
          genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes often act in concert within specific
          cellular contexts to influence complex traits. Understanding these
          gene-gene interactions and their regulation across conditions is
          critical for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have uncovered the roles of individual genes,
          modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in the origin and progression of complex diseases.

          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed

          Revised paragraph:


          Genetic studies have uncovered numerous associations between genetic
          variants and complex traits, but fully understanding the biological
          mechanisms underlying these associations remains a challenge.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped elucidate the role
          of individual genes, yet modern models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions are crucial for disease etiology and progression. To
          address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Here, we
          show that this representation, based on modules of co-expressed genes,
          can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms
          of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking direct
          genetic associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules
          by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our
          approach can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. These findings
          demonstrate how projecting genetic signals through gene expression
          patterns can highlight disease etiology and uncover new drug
          mechanisms, ultimately advancing our understanding of complex traits
          and accelerating the development of effective therapies.

          Here is the revised abstract paragraph following the C-C-C scheme:


          Context: Determining how genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover
          the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but
          modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression. However, current approaches are limited in their ability
          to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.


          Content: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


          Conclusion: By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies, providing a more comprehensive
          understanding of how genes influence complex traits in specific
          biological contexts. This advance moves the field forward by enabling
          the development of new therapies that account for the complex,
          interconnected nature of gene regulation in disease.

          Here is a revised version of the abstract:


          Genetic studies have uncovered numerous associations between genes and
          complex traits, but translating these findings into mechanistic
          insights and therapeutic applications remains a challenge. In this
          work, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of co-expressed genes, which capture the
          coordinated regulation of genes across diverse conditions. We
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, by analyzing a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important genes often lack direct associations
          but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating information about co-expressed gene modules, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          therapeutic targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. This
          is crucial, as genes often act in concert within specific cellular
          contexts to influence complex phenotypes. Integrating
          transcriptome-wide association studies with co-expression patterns can
          thus provide a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular
          mechanisms underlying complex traits and facilitate the development of
          new therapies.

          Genetic studies have provided valuable insights into the biological
          mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases. However, the
          translation of genetic associations to functional understanding and
          therapeutic development remains a major challenge. (Context) This
          manuscript introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation to enable joint analysis. (Content) By

          PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players that lack direct

          therapeutic targets. (Conclusion) Collectively, this work showcases
          the power of integrating gene expression patterns with genetic and
          pharmacological data to enhance our understanding of disease etiology
          and accelerate the discovery of new drug mechanisms, ultimately

          Context: Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover

          patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell

          Conclusion: By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. This approach provides a powerful
          framework to uncover the complex relationships between genes, traits,
          and therapeutic interventions, advancing our mechanistic understanding
          of complex diseases.

          Here is a revised version of the abstract:


          Genetic studies have provided valuable insights into the molecular
          underpinnings of complex traits and diseases. However, translating
          these genetic associations into a mechanistic understanding of disease
          etiology and therapeutic opportunities remains a significant
          challenge. In this work, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed
          genes, which capture the coordinated regulation of genes across
          diverse biological conditions. 


          Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is
          accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by incorporating information about
          co-expressed gene modules, PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally
          important players that may lack direct genetic associations but are
          embedded within trait-associated gene networks. This highlights the
          importance of considering the context-dependent, systems-level
          organization of gene expression in interpreting genetic findings and
          identifying therapeutic targets.


          Taken together, this work showcases how integrating genetic
          associations with functional genomic data can provide a more
          comprehensive understanding of disease biology and facilitate the
          repurposing of existing drugs or the discovery of new therapeutic
          strategies. By leveraging the insights into gene co-expression
          patterns, PhenoPLIER offers a powerful approach to bridge the gap
          between genetic discoveries and mechanistic insights that can guide
          the development of novel interventions.

          Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
          their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical
          for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER,
          a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies.

          Genes often work together in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation
          across different conditions. This insight is critical for developing
          new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
          uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.
          However, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression. We find that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we identify functionally important players that lack
          individual genetic associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by our method, PhenoPLIER. PhenoPLIER is a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of
          co-expressed genes across the same conditions. By incorporating groups
          of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
          associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies.

          The genetic basis of complex traits and diseases remains a major
          challenge in human genetics. While genome-wide association studies
          have identified numerous genetic variants associated with complex
          phenotypes, disentangling the underlying biological mechanisms remains
          difficult. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover
          the role of individual genes, but modern models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          Here is a revised version of the abstract:


          Genes often work together in specific contexts to perform their
          functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation
          across different conditions. This insight is critical for developing
          new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
          uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.
          However, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression. We observe that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by our method, PhenoPLIER. PhenoPLIER is a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed
          genes across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research

          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in complex trait architecture and

          promising drug repurposing opportunities.

          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed

          Genetic studies have long sought to uncover the complex relationships
          between genes and their influence on disease traits. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights
          into the roles of individual genes, modern models suggest that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in the origin and
          progression of complex diseases (context). Here, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis (content). By incorporating groups
          of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
          associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets that may have
          been missed by single-gene strategies (content). Our results
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate
          in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action (content). Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER (content). This work highlights the power of
          integrating gene expression patterns with genetic and pharmacological
          data to uncover the complex etiology of diseases and identify novel
          drug mechanisms (conclusion).

          Here is a revised version of the abstract:


          Genes often work together in specific biological contexts to carry out
          their functions. Unraveling how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation
          across different conditions. Such insights are crucial for developing
          new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
          uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant processes.
          However, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and
          progression. We observe that diseases are significantly associated
          with gene co-expression modules active in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by our method, PhenoPLIER. PhenoPLIER is a computational
          framework that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed
          genes across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.


          Key changes:

          1. Clarified the importance of understanding gene expression
          regulation for developing new therapies.

          2. Emphasized the role of gene-gene interactions in complex trait
          architecture.

          3. Streamlined the description of the PhenoPLIER approach and its
          advantages over single-gene strategies.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genetic studies have long sought to understand how genes and their
          interactions contribute to complex traits and diseases. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the roles of
          individual genes, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions
          play a crucial role in disease origin and progression (context). Here,
          we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
          strategies (content). Our results show that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
          PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER (conclusion). This work highlights the
          importance of considering gene expression patterns and co-expression
          networks to uncover the complex genetic architecture of diseases and
          identify promising drug targets for therapeutic development.

          Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions.
          Understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions, which is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players lack individual associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by our method, PhenoPLIER.
          PhenoPLIER is a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based
          on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies.


          Key changes:

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          Genetic studies have provided valuable insights into the molecular
          underpinnings of complex traits and diseases. However, the
          architecture of these traits is often complex, involving intricate
          gene-gene interactions that are not fully captured by traditional
          single-gene association analyses (context). Here, we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis (content). By incorporating groups
          of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
          associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets that may be
          missed by conventional single-gene strategies (content). Our results
          show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action
          (content). Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER (content). This integrated approach highlights
          the importance of considering gene expression patterns and
          co-regulation in understanding the etiology of complex traits and
          identifying novel drug mechanisms (conclusion).

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          Revised paragraph:


          Genetic studies have identified numerous associations between genetic
          variants and complex traits, but fully elucidating the underlying
          mechanisms remains a challenge. Transcriptome-wide association studies
          have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          pathways, yet modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
          crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap,
          we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. Here, we show that by
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results demonstrate that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players lack individual associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting
          the power of this approach to uncover novel insights into the genetic
          architecture of complex traits and guide drug discovery efforts.

          Genes often work together in specific contexts to carry out their
          functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation
          across different conditions. This insight is crucial for developing
          new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
          uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.
          However, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes across the
          same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential

          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER.


          Key changes:

          1. Streamlined and clarified the language in the first few sentences.

          2. Emphasized the importance of understanding gene expression
          regulation for developing new therapies.

          3. Clarified the role of gene-gene interactions in complex trait
          architecture.

          4. Simplified the description of the PhenoPLIER approach and its key

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          Genetic studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models suggest that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in the origin and progression of
          complex traits. To address this gap, the present study introduces
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation for joint analysis. Here, we show that by incorporating
          groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
          associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the importance of
          considering gene co-expression patterns to elucidate the complex
          etiology of diseases and identify promising drug repurposing
          opportunities.

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          Genetic studies have greatly expanded our understanding of the
          molecular underpinnings of complex traits and diseases. However, the
          architecture of these traits is inherently polygenic, with gene-gene
          interactions playing a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          To address this, the field of functional genomics has developed
          methods to contextualize genetic associations by mapping them to
          patterns of gene co-expression across diverse conditions (context).
          Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that jointly
          models gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
          to uncover the modular organization of the transcriptome and its
          relationship to complex phenotypes (content). We demonstrate that
          PhenoPLIER can accurately predict known drug-disease connections and
          infer mechanisms of action, while also prioritizing functionally
          important players missed by single-gene strategies (conclusion). Our
          results highlight the power of integrating genetic and gene expression
          data to elucidate the underlying biology of complex traits and
          identify promising therapeutic targets (broader significance).

          Here is a revised version of the abstract:


          Genes often work together in specific contexts to carry out their
          functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation
          across different conditions. This insight is crucial for developing
          new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
          uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.
          However, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that
          gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
          progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes across the

          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential

          lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER.


          Key changes:

          1. Simplified and clarified the opening sentences to improve flow and
          readability.

          2. Rephrased the sentence on the importance of understanding gene
          expression regulation for therapy development to make it more concise.

          3. Streamlined the description of PhenoPLIER and its key features,
          such as the use of co-expressed gene modules and its ability to
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets.

          4. Restructured the last paragraph to better highlight the key
          findings, such as the association between diseases and relevant cell
          type-specific gene modules, the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in predicting
          drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action, and the
          identification of functionally important players in the CRISPR screen.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          Genetic studies have identified numerous associations between genetic
          variants and complex traits, but a mechanistic understanding of how
          these genetic factors influence disease etiology and drug response
          remains elusive. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
          uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms,
          but modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that

          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by

          uncovering the complex genetic architecture of disease and therapeutic
          response.

          literature by leveraging gene co-expression patterns to contextualize
          genetic associations and uncover potential therapeutic targets that
          may have been missed by traditional single-gene analyses. This

          Here is the revised abstract for the manuscript titled "Projecting
          genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms":


          Genes often work together in specific biological contexts to carry out
          their functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex
          traits requires a mechanistic understanding of gene expression
          regulation across different conditions. Such insights are crucial for
          developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of complex trait architecture
          suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease
          origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed
          genes across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players lack individual associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          Genetic studies have long sought to uncover the molecular mechanisms
          underlying complex traits and diseases. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have helped elucidate the role of individual
          genes, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
          crucial role in disease origin and progression. This manuscript
          introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation for joint analysis. Here, we leverage modules of
          co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal
          potential therapeutic targets that may be missed by single-gene
          strategies. Our results show that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
          PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
          direct genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated
          modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the power of
          integrating gene expression patterns with genetic and pharmacological
          data to uncover the complex etiology of diseases and identify
          promising drug repurposing opportunities.

              Here is a revised version of the abstract:


              Genes work in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. This insight is critical
              for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
              architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
              play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. 


              Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack individual associations but
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies.


              The key revisions include:

              - Improving grammar and clarity of phrasing (e.g. "in concierto"
              -> "in concert", "specifico" -> "specific")

              - Removing unnecessary or redundant words (e.g. "It has been shown
              that this insight is critical...")

              - Restructuring sentences for better flow and logical progression
              of ideas

              - Ensuring consistent verb tense (e.g. "have helped" -> "have
              helped uncover")

              - Clarifying technical terms and concepts (e.g.
              "transcriptome-wide association studies", "CRISPR screen")

              Genetic studies have long sought to understand how genes influence
              complex traits, with the ultimate goal of developing new
              therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest
              that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin
              and progression. This gap in the current literature motivates the
              need for computational approaches that can capture these
              higher-order genetic effects. (Context)


              Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel method that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of co-expressed genes, allowing PhenoPLIER to
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
              therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. We find that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, by analyzing a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation, we
              show that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important players
              that lack individual associations. (Content)


              By incorporating information on co-expressed gene modules,
              PhenoPLIER provides a powerful tool for elucidating the complex
              genetic architecture of disease and identifying promising
              therapeutic targets. This advance moves the field of functional
              genomics closer to realizing the promise of personalized medicine.

              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper

              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.

              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel

              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader

              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression

              patterns and co-expression modules to understand the genetic basis
              of complex traits and identify novel therapeutic targets.

              Genetic studies have provided valuable insights into the molecular
              underpinnings of complex traits and diseases. However, a
              comprehensive understanding of how genes interact to influence
              these phenotypes remains elusive. (Context) The key challenge lies
              in bridging the gap between genetic associations and the
              underlying biological mechanisms, which is crucial for developing
              effective therapies. (Context) Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes, but
              modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal
              role in disease origin and progression. (Context)


              (Content) Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes, allowing
              us to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
              therapeutic targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies.
              (Content)


              (Conclusion) Our results show that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally
              important players that lack individual associations, highlighting
              its potential to advance our understanding of disease etiology and
              drug mechanisms. (Conclusion)

              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an

              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader

            inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
            to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
            players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
            modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed

              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
              requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions. This insight is critical for
              developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
              architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
              play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack individual associations but
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By

              The key changes made are:

              1. Correcting grammatical and spelling errors (e.g., "concierto"
              to "together", "specifico" to "specific", "significantl" to
              "significantly").

              2. Simplifying and clarifying the language to improve readability.

              3. Providing more details on the PhenoPLIER approach and its key
              findings.

              4. Emphasizing the importance of considering gene-gene
              interactions and co-expression modules, rather than just
              individual genes, for understanding complex traits and identifying
              potential therapeutic targets.

              Here is the revised abstract following the
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme:


              Context: Determining how genes influence complex traits requires a
              mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions, which is critical for developing new
              therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, modern models of the architecture of complex traits
              predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
              origin and progression. However, current approaches have been
              limited in their ability to fully capture these complex
              relationships.


              Content: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              This representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack individual
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER.


              Conclusion: By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential therapeutic targets that may have been missed by
              single-gene strategies. This approach highlights the importance of
              considering gene-gene interactions in understanding the etiology
              of complex traits and identifying novel drug mechanisms.

              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)

              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an

              Here is a revised version of the abstract:


              Genes often act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. This insight is critical
              for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
              architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
              play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack individual associations but
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies.


              The key changes made are:

              1. Improved grammar and sentence structure (e.g., "in concierto"
              -> "in concert", "specifico" -> "specific", "significantl" ->
              "significantly").

              2. Clarified the purpose and findings of the study.

              3. Removed redundant phrases (e.g., "It has been shown that this
              insight is critical for developing new therapies").

              4. Emphasized the importance of gene-gene interactions and
              co-expression modules in understanding complex traits and
              identifying potential therapeutic targets.

              Genetic studies have long sought to uncover the complex mechanisms
              underlying common diseases and identify potential therapeutic
              targets. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              provided valuable insights into the role of individual genes,
              modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial
              role in disease etiology and progression (context). Here we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis (content). This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across diverse conditions, allowing us to
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. Our results show that diseases
              are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in

              regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
              individual associations are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER (content). By incorporating groups of

              The regulation of gene expression is crucial for understanding

              Revised paragraph:


              Genetic studies have provided valuable insights into the molecular
              underpinnings of complex traits and diseases. However, a
              comprehensive understanding of how genes interact to influence
              these phenotypes remains elusive. (Context) The current literature
              has primarily focused on individual gene-trait associations,
              overlooking the crucial role of gene-gene interactions in disease
              etiology and progression. (Context) To address this gap, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that
              integrates gene expression patterns and pharmacological
              perturbation data to uncover the modular architecture of complex
              traits. (Content) By mapping gene-trait associations and drug
              mechanisms into a shared latent representation, PhenoPLIER reveals
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. (Content)
              Furthermore, our approach prioritizes functionally important
              players that lack individual associations, highlighting the power
              of incorporating co-expressed gene modules to contextualize
              genetic findings and identify potential therapeutic targets missed
              by single-gene strategies. (Conclusion) These results demonstrate
              the value of leveraging gene expression patterns to project
              genetic associations and uncover the intricate interplay of genes
              underlying complex phenotypes, paving the way for more targeted
              and effective therapeutic interventions. (Conclusion)

              Here is a revised version of the abstract:


              Genetic studies have provided valuable insights into the
              biological mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases.
              However, translating these genetic associations into therapeutic
              targets remains challenging. In this work, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data to uncover
              disease etiology and potential drug mechanisms. PhenoPLIER maps
              these diverse data sources into a common latent representation
              based on modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions.
              We observe that disease-associated genes are significantly
              enriched in modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships
              while also inferring novel mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by
              prioritizing functionally important genes that may lack direct
              genetic associations, PhenoPLIER complements single-gene
              strategies and provides a more comprehensive view of the
              underlying biology. 


              The key innovations of this work are: 1) the integration of
              genetic, transcriptomic, and pharmacological data to enable a
              systems-level understanding of complex traits; 2) the use of gene
              co-expression modules to contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential therapeutic targets; and 3) the ability to
              identify functionally important players that may be missed by
              traditional approaches focused on individual genes. By leveraging
              the concerted actions of genes within specific biological
              contexts, PhenoPLIER offers a promising path for translating
              genetic discoveries into new therapies.

              Here, we present a novel computational approach, PhenoPLIER, that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data to uncover the underlying mechanisms of complex
              diseases. Existing transcriptome-wide association studies have
              been limited in their ability to capture the context-dependent,
              interactive nature of gene expression regulation, which is crucial
              for understanding the etiology of complex traits. To address this
              gap, PhenoPLIER maps genetic associations and drug effects onto a
              common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed
              genes. Here, we show that this approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease relationships and reveals potential mechanisms of
              action. Notably, PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important
              genes that lack direct associations but are embedded within
              trait-associated gene modules. By leveraging the collective
              behavior of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a more
              comprehensive and contextual understanding of how genetic
              variations influence complex phenotypes. This framework can guide
              the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and facilitate drug
              repurposing efforts, ultimately advancing our understanding of
              disease etiology and paving the way for more effective

              Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid

              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual

              Here is the revised abstract following the
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme:


              Context: Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
              uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
              traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
              disease origin and progression. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions, which is
              critical for developing new therapies.


              Content: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              This representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              Conclusion: By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach
              provides a more comprehensive understanding of how genes act in
              concert with each other in specific contexts to influence complex
              traits, which is crucial for developing new therapies.

              Here is a revised version of the abstract:


              Genetic studies have identified numerous associations between
              genes and complex traits, but translating these findings into
              mechanistic insights and therapeutic strategies remains a
              challenge. In this work, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed
              genes, which capture the context-dependent functional
              relationships between genes. 


              Our analysis reveals that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
              is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to study
              lipid regulation, we find that functionally important genes often
              lack direct genetic associations but are prioritized within
              trait-associated gene modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating
              information on co-expressed gene modules, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
              therapeutic targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies.


              Genes do not act in isolation, but rather function in concert with
              each other in specific cellular contexts. Determining how these
              gene-gene interactions influence complex traits is critical for
              understanding disease etiology and developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have begun to uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but
              modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene
              co-expression patterns may provide key insights into the
              underlying biology.

              Here is the revised abstract following the
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme:


              Context: Genetic studies have identified numerous associations
              between genetic variants and complex traits, but elucidating the
              underlying mechanisms remains a major challenge. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have provided insights into
              the role of individual genes, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions are crucial for understanding disease etiology and
              progression. 


              Content: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes, which we
              show are significantly associated with diseases in relevant cell
              types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
              and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by analyzing a
              CRISPR screen on lipid regulation, we find that functionally
              important genes lacking direct associations are prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              Conclusion: By incorporating information on groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. This highlights the importance of considering
              gene-gene interactions to understand complex trait architecture

              Here is the revised abstract paragraph following the
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme:


              Context: Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
              uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
              traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
              disease origin and progression. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions, which is
              critical for developing new therapies.


              Content: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              This representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              Conclusion: By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach
              advances our mechanistic understanding of how genes act in concert
              within specific contexts to influence complex traits, which is
              crucial for developing new therapies.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              Revised paragraph:


              Genetic studies have uncovered numerous associations between
              genetic variants and complex traits, but fully understanding the
              biological mechanisms underlying these associations remains a
              challenge. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
              elucidate the role of individual genes, yet modern models suggest
              that gene-gene interactions are crucial for disease etiology and
              progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. Here, we show that this
              representation, based on modules of co-expressed genes, can
              accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms
              of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking
              direct genetic associations are prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, our approach can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. These findings demonstrate how projecting
              genetic signals through gene expression patterns can highlight
              disease etiology and uncover new drug mechanisms, ultimately
              advancing our understanding of complex traits and accelerating the

              Here is the revised abstract paragraph following the C-C-C scheme:


              Context: Determining how genes influence complex traits requires a
              mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
              helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, but modern models of the architecture of complex
              traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
              disease origin and progression. However, current approaches are
              limited in their ability to contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.


              Content: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              This representation is based on modules of genes with similar

              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              Conclusion: By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a
              more comprehensive understanding of how genes influence complex
              traits in specific biological contexts. This advance moves the
              field forward by enabling the development of new therapies that
              account for the complex, interconnected nature of gene regulation
              in disease.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint

              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of

              concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their
              functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
              requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight
              is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of
              the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene

              Here is a revised version of the abstract:


              Genetic studies have uncovered numerous associations between genes
              and complex traits, but translating these findings into
              mechanistic insights and therapeutic applications remains a
              challenge. In this work, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed
              genes, which capture the coordinated regulation of genes across
              diverse conditions. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by analyzing a CRISPR
              screen for lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              genes often lack direct associations but are prioritized within
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating
              information about co-expressed gene modules, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
              therapeutic targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies.
              This is crucial, as genes often act in concert within specific
              cellular contexts to influence complex phenotypes. Integrating
              transcriptome-wide association studies with co-expression patterns
              can thus provide a more comprehensive understanding of the
              molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits and facilitate the
              development of new therapies.

              Genetic studies have provided valuable insights into the
              biological mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases.
              However, the translation of genetic associations to functional
              understanding and therapeutic development remains a major
              challenge. (Context) This manuscript introduces PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation to enable joint analysis. (Content) By

              Here is the revised abstract following the C-C-C scheme:


              Context: Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
              uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
              traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
              disease origin and progression. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions, which is
              critical for developing new therapies.


              Content: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              This representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
              known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              Conclusion: By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. This approach
              provides a powerful framework to uncover the complex relationships
              between genes, traits, and therapeutic interventions, advancing
              our mechanistic understanding of complex diseases.

            gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
            common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression

            significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant

            drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,

            functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
            in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups
            of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
            associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
            strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in specific
            contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
            influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of

              Here is a revised version of the abstract:


              Genetic studies have provided valuable insights into the molecular
              underpinnings of complex traits and diseases. However, translating
              these genetic associations into a mechanistic understanding of
              disease etiology and therapeutic opportunities remains a
              significant challenge. In this work, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of co-expressed genes, which capture the coordinated
              regulation of genes across diverse biological conditions. 


              Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
              is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by incorporating information
              about co-expressed gene modules, PhenoPLIER can prioritize
              functionally important players that may lack direct genetic
              associations but are embedded within trait-associated gene
              networks. This highlights the importance of considering the
              context-dependent, systems-level organization of gene expression
              in interpreting genetic findings and identifying therapeutic
              targets.


              Taken together, this work showcases how integrating genetic
              associations with functional genomic data can provide a more
              comprehensive understanding of disease biology and facilitate the
              repurposing of existing drugs or the discovery of new therapeutic
              strategies. By leveraging the insights into gene co-expression
              patterns, PhenoPLIER offers a powerful approach to bridge the gap
              between genetic discoveries and mechanistic insights that can
              guide the development of novel interventions.

              Revised paragraph:


              Genetic studies have identified numerous associations between
              genetic variants and complex traits, but understanding the
              underlying biological mechanisms remains a significant challenge.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits suggest that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for a joint analysis. Here, we show that this
              representation, based on modules of genes with similar expression
              patterns across the same conditions, allows us to accurately
              predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action.

              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question

              distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader

              Context: Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
              uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
              traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in

              Here is a revised version of the abstract:


              Genes often work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits
              requires a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation
              across different conditions. This insight is critical for
              developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of complex
              trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
              crucial role in disease origin and progression. We find that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we identify
              functionally important players that lack individual genetic
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              our method, PhenoPLIER. PhenoPLIER is a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes across
              the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

              The genetic basis of complex traits and diseases remains a major
              challenge in human genetics. While genome-wide association studies
              have identified numerous genetic variants associated with complex
              phenotypes, disentangling the underlying biological mechanisms
              remains difficult. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
              helped uncover the role of individual genes, but modern models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
              origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. We show that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs

              important players lack individual associations but are prioritized

              the importance of considering gene expression patterns to
              elucidate the genetic architecture of complex traits and identify
              novel therapeutic opportunities.

              Genetic studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models suggest that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in complex trait
              architecture and disease etiology. To address this gap, the
              present study introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
              into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Here, we
              show that PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential therapeutic targets by incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes into the analysis. Specifically, we observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack individual
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the power of integrating gene
              expression patterns with genetic and pharmacological data to
              uncover the complex underpinnings of disease and identify
              promising drug repurposing opportunities.

              Genes often work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits
              requires a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation
              across different conditions. This insight is crucial for

              Genetic studies have long sought to uncover the complex
              relationships between genes and their influence on disease traits.
              While transcriptome-wide association studies have provided
              valuable insights into the roles of individual genes, modern
              models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
              the origin and progression of complex diseases (context). Here, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis (content). By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
              therapeutic targets that may have been missed by single-gene
              strategies (content). Our results demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action (content).
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack individual
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by

              and identify novel drug mechanisms (conclusion).

              Genes work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions, and understanding how these genes influence complex
              traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the
              architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions
              play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. This
              highlights the need for novel computational approaches that can
              capture these interactions and contextualize genetic associations.


              Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes, allowing
              PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Using a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
              important players lack individual associations but are prioritized
              in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Furthermore, our
              approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action, demonstrating its potential to
              uncover novel insights into the complex architecture of disease.

              Here is a revised version of the abstract:


              Genes often work together in specific biological contexts to carry
              out their functions. Unraveling how these genes influence complex
              traits requires a mechanistic understanding of gene expression
              regulation across different conditions. Such insights are crucial
              for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
              studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant processes. However, modern models of complex
              trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
              pivotal role in disease origin and progression. We observe that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene co-expression
              modules active in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack individual
              associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
              our method, PhenoPLIER. PhenoPLIER is a computational framework
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes across
              the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.


              Key changes:

              1. Clarified the importance of understanding gene expression
              regulation for developing new therapies.

              2. Emphasized the role of gene-gene interactions in complex trait
              architecture.

              3. Streamlined the description of the PhenoPLIER approach and its
              advantages over single-gene strategies.

              4. Improved the flow and clarity of the abstract.

              Genetic studies have long sought to understand how genes and their
              interactions contribute to complex traits and diseases. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the roles of
              individual genes, modern models suggest that gene-gene

              Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is

              The complex interplay between genes and their regulation is
              crucial for understanding the mechanisms underlying complex traits
              and diseases. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              provided insights into the role of individual genes, modern models
              suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease
              origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach in
              predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
              action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
              individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. This novel framework provides a powerful
              tool for uncovering the complex architecture of gene regulation
              and its implications for disease and drug discovery.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits
              requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions, which is critical for developing new
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
              uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms. However, modern models of complex trait architecture
              predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
              origin and progression. We observe that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack individual associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by our method, PhenoPLIER. PhenoPLIER is
              a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on

              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies.


              Key changes:

              1. Streamlined and simplified the writing to improve clarity and
              conciseness.

              2. Removed redundant phrases and combined related ideas.

              3. Clarified the description of PhenoPLIER and its key features.

              4. Emphasized the importance of gene co-expression and
              module-based analysis for understanding complex traits and
              identifying therapeutic targets.

              Genetic studies have provided valuable insights into the molecular
              underpinnings of complex traits and diseases. However, the
              architecture of these traits is often complex, involving intricate
              gene-gene interactions that are not fully captured by traditional
              single-gene association analyses (context). Here, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis (content). By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
              therapeutic targets that may be missed by conventional single-gene
              strategies (content). Our results show that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action (content).
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we

              Genes often work together in specific biological contexts to carry
              out their functions. Understanding how these gene interactions
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              gene expression regulation across different conditions. This
              knowledge is crucial for developing new therapies.

              Revised paragraph:


              Genetic studies have identified numerous associations between
              genetic variants and complex traits, but fully elucidating the
              underlying mechanisms remains a challenge. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant pathways, yet modern models suggest that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. Here, we show that by
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
              therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is
              accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack individual associations but are prioritized in

              this approach to uncover novel insights into the genetic

              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.

              distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current

              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)

              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an

              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader

            Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
            their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex
            traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
            across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
            the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
            PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
            potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that
            diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
            relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
            known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
            Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we

              Here is a revised version of the abstract:


              Genes often work together in specific contexts to carry out their
              functions. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits
              requires a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation
              across different conditions. This insight is crucial for
              developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of complex
              trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a
              crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is
              based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions.
              By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack individual associations but
              are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.


              Key changes:

              1. Streamlined and clarified the language in the first few
              sentences.

              2. Emphasized the importance of understanding gene expression
              regulation for developing new therapies.

              3. Clarified the role of gene-gene interactions in complex trait
              architecture.

              4. Simplified the description of the PhenoPLIER approach and its
              key features.

              5. Strengthened the connection between the PhenoPLIER approach and
              the CRISPR screen findings.

              The regulation of gene expression is crucial for understanding

              Here is the revised abstract:


              Genes often work together in specific contexts to perform their
              biological functions. Understanding how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of gene
              expression regulation across different conditions. Such insights
              are crucial for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of
              complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions
              play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes across
              the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack individual associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Genetic studies have greatly expanded our understanding of the
              molecular underpinnings of complex traits and diseases. However,
              the architecture of these traits is inherently polygenic, with
              gene-gene interactions playing a crucial role in disease origin
              and progression. To address this, the field of functional genomics
              has developed methods to contextualize genetic associations by
              mapping them to patterns of gene co-expression across diverse
              conditions (context). Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that jointly models gene-trait associations
              and pharmacological perturbation data to uncover the modular
              organization of the transcriptome and its relationship to complex
              phenotypes (content). We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can
              accurately predict known drug-disease connections and infer
              mechanisms of action, while also prioritizing functionally
              important players missed by single-gene strategies (conclusion).
              Our results highlight the power of integrating genetic and gene
              expression data to elucidate the underlying biology of complex
              traits and identify promising therapeutic targets (broader
              significance).

              such as the use of co-expressed gene modules and its ability to
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets.

              4. Restructured the last paragraph to better highlight the key
              findings, such as the association between diseases and relevant
              cell type-specific gene modules, the accuracy of PhenoPLIER in

              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
              drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              Genetic studies have identified numerous associations between
              genetic variants and complex traits, but a mechanistic
              understanding of how these genetic factors influence disease
              etiology and drug response remains elusive. Transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models of the
              architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
              play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here, we
              introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating
              groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
              to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER, highlighting the value of this integrative
              approach in uncovering the complex genetic architecture of disease
              and therapeutic response.

              Here is the revised abstract following the
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme:


              Context: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts
              to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions, which is critical for
              developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the architecture of
              complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial
              role in disease origin and progression. This highlights the need
              for computational approaches that can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies.


              Content: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
              that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
              data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.
              This representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating
              groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
              to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER.


              Conclusion: The PhenoPLIER approach addresses the gap in current
              literature by leveraging gene co-expression patterns to
              contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential
              therapeutic targets that may have been missed by traditional
              single-gene analyses. This advancement in understanding the
              complex interplay of genes and their role in disease mechanisms
              has broader significance for the development of more effective and
              personalized therapies.

              Genes often work together in specific biological contexts to carry

              Genetic studies have long sought to uncover the molecular
              mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have helped elucidate the
              role of individual genes, modern models suggest that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. This manuscript introduces PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. Here, we leverage modules of
              co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential therapeutic targets that may be missed by
              single-gene strategies. Our results show that diseases are

              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
              abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence
              structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should
              follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
              The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
              will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing
              the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the

              perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By

              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets

              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions, and determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the
              architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
              play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address
              this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
              maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data
              into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
              representation is based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating
              groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. Our results show that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs
              and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
              important players lack associations but are prioritized in
              trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER, demonstrating the broader
              significance of this method in uncovering complex gene-gene
              interactions that underlie complex traits.
