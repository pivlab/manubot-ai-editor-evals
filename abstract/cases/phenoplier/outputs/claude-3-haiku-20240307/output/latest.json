Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

          "output": "Genetic studies have long sought to understand how genes influence complex traits, with the ultimate goal of developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. This gap in the current literature motivates the need for computational approaches that can capture these higher-order genetic effects. (Context)\n\nHere, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel method that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes, allowing PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. We find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by analyzing a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation, we show that PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important players that lack individual associations. (Content)\n\nBy incorporating information on co-expressed gene modules, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful tool for elucidating the complex genetic architecture of disease and identifying promising therapeutic targets. This advance moves the field of functional genomics closer to realizing the promise of personalized medicine. (Conclusion)"

Correcting grammatical and spelling errors (e.g., \"concierto\" to \"together\", \"specifico\" to \"specific\", \"significantl\" to \"significantly\").\n2. Simplifying and clarifying the language to improve readability.\n3. Providing more details on the PhenoPLIER approach and its key findings.\n4.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph.

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

          "output": "Revised paragraph:\n\nGenetic studies have provided valuable insights into the molecular underpinnings of complex traits and diseases. However, a comprehensive understanding of how genes interact to influence these phenotypes remains elusive. (Context) The current literature has primarily focused on individual gene-trait associations, overlooking the crucial role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression. (Context) To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene expression patterns and pharmacological perturbation data to uncover the modular architecture of complex traits. (Content) By mapping gene-trait associations and drug mechanisms into a shared latent representation, PhenoPLIER reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. (Content) Furthermore, our approach prioritizes functionally important players that lack individual associations, highlighting the power of incorporating co-expressed gene modules to contextualize genetic findings and identify potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. (Conclusion) These results demonstrate the value of leveraging gene expression patterns to project genetic associations and uncover the intricate interplay of genes underlying complex phenotypes, paving the way for more targeted and effective therapeutic interventions.

          "output": "Here is a revised version of the abstract:\n\nGenetic studies have provided valuable insights into the biological mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases. However, translating these genetic associations into therapeutic targets remains challenging. In this work, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data to uncover disease etiology and potential drug mechanisms. PhenoPLIER maps these diverse data sources into a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions. We observe that disease-associated genes are significantly enriched in modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships while also inferring novel mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by prioritizing functionally important genes that may lack direct genetic associations, PhenoPLIER complements single-gene strategies and provides a more comprehensive view of the underlying biology. \n\nThe key innovations of this work are: 1) the integration of genetic, transcriptomic, and pharmacological data to enable a systems-level understanding of complex traits; 2) the use of gene co-expression modules to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets; and 3) the ability to identify functionally important players that may be missed by traditional approaches focused on individual genes. By leveraging the concerted actions of genes within specific biological contexts, PhenoPLIER offers a promising path for translating genetic discoveries into new therapies."

          "output": "Here, we present a novel computational approach, PhenoPLIER, that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data to uncover the underlying mechanisms of complex diseases. Existing transcriptome-wide association studies have been limited in their ability to capture the context-dependent, interactive nature of gene expression regulation, which is crucial for understanding the etiology of complex traits. To address this gap, PhenoPLIER maps genetic associations and drug effects onto a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes. Here, we show that this approach accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships and reveals potential mechanisms of action. Notably, PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes that lack direct associations but are embedded within trait-associated gene modules. By leveraging the collective behavior of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a more comprehensive and contextual understanding of how genetic variations influence complex phenotypes. This framework can guide the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and facilitate drug repurposing efforts, ultimately advancing our understanding of disease etiology and paving the way for more effective interventions."

While transcriptome-wide association studies have provided insights into the role of individual genes, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial for understanding disease etiology and progression. \n\nContent: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes, which we show are significantly associated with diseases in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by analyzing a CRISPR screen on lipid regulation, we find that functionally important genes lacking direct associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nConclusion: By incorporating information on groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. This highlights the importance of considering gene-gene interactions to understand complex trait architecture and develop new therapies."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

However, translating these genetic associations into a mechanistic understanding of disease etiology and therapeutic opportunities remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes, which capture the coordinated regulation of genes across diverse biological conditions. \n\nOur results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by incorporating information about co-expressed gene modules, PhenoPLIER can prioritize functionally important players that may lack direct genetic associations but are embedded within trait-associated gene networks. This highlights the importance of considering the context-dependent, systems-level organization of gene expression in interpreting genetic findings and identifying therapeutic targets.\n\nTaken together, this work showcases how integrating genetic associations with functional genomic data can provide a more comprehensive understanding of disease biology and facilitate the repurposing of existing drugs or the discovery of new therapeutic strategies. By leveraging the insights into gene co-expression patterns, PhenoPLIER offers a powerful approach to bridge the gap between genetic discoveries and mechanistic insights that can guide the development of novel interventions."

          "output": "Here is a revised version of the abstract:\n\nGenes often work together in specific biological contexts to carry out their functions. Unraveling how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across different conditions. Such insights are crucial for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant processes. However, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene co-expression modules active in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by our method, PhenoPLIER. PhenoPLIER is a computational framework that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nKey changes:\n1. Clarified the importance of understanding gene expression regulation for developing new therapies.\n2. Emphasized the role of gene-gene interactions in complex trait architecture.\n3. Streamlined the description of the PhenoPLIER approach and its advantages over single-gene strategies.\n4. Improved the flow and clarity of the abstract."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER."

          "output": "Genetic studies have greatly expanded our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of complex traits and diseases. However, the architecture of these traits is inherently polygenic, with gene-gene interactions playing a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address this, the field of functional genomics has developed methods to contextualize genetic associations by mapping them to patterns of gene co-expression across diverse conditions (context). Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that jointly models gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data to uncover the modular organization of the transcriptome and its relationship to complex phenotypes (content). We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can accurately predict known drug-disease connections and infer mechanisms of action, while also prioritizing functionally important players missed by single-gene strategies (conclusion). Our results highlight the power of integrating genetic and gene expression data to elucidate the underlying biology of complex traits and identify promising therapeutic targets (broader significance)."

A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped elucidate the role of individual genes, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. This manuscript introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Here, we leverage modules of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking direct genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the power of integrating gene expression patterns with genetic and pharmacological data to uncover the complex etiology of diseases and identify promising drug repurposing opportunities."

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. This insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. \n\nHere we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nThe key revisions include:\n- Improving grammar and clarity of phrasing (e.g. \"in concierto\" -> \"in concert\", \"specifico\" -> \"specific\")\n- Removing unnecessary or redundant words (e.g. \"It has been shown that this insight is critical...\")\n- Restructuring sentences for better flow and logical progression of ideas\n- Ensuring consistent verb tense (e.g. \"have helped\" -> \"have helped uncover\")\n- Clarifying technical terms and concepts (e.g. \"transcriptome-wide association studies\", \"CRISPR screen\")",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture suggest that gene-gene interactions play a key role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes across diverse conditions. Here, we show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, thus advancing our understanding of complex trait architecture and facilitating the development of new therapies.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

However, a comprehensive understanding of how genes interact to influence these phenotypes remains elusive. (Context) The current literature has primarily focused on individual gene-trait associations, overlooking the crucial role of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression. (Context) To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene expression patterns and pharmacological perturbation data to uncover the modular architecture of complex traits. (Content) By mapping gene-trait associations and drug mechanisms into a shared latent representation, PhenoPLIER reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs while inferring mechanisms of action. (Content) Furthermore, our approach prioritizes functionally important players that lack individual associations, highlighting the power of incorporating co-expressed gene modules to contextualize genetic findings and identify potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. (Conclusion) These results demonstrate the value of leveraging gene expression patterns to project genetic associations and uncover the intricate interplay of genes underlying complex phenotypes, paving the way for more targeted and effective therapeutic interventions. (Conclusion)",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

However, translating these genetic associations into therapeutic targets remains challenging. In this work, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data to uncover disease etiology and potential drug mechanisms. PhenoPLIER maps these diverse data sources into a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions. We observe that disease-associated genes are significantly enriched in modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships while also inferring novel mechanisms of action. Furthermore, by prioritizing functionally important genes that may lack direct genetic associations, PhenoPLIER complements single-gene strategies and provides a more comprehensive view of the underlying biology. \n\nThe key innovations of this work are: 1) the integration of genetic, transcriptomic, and pharmacological data to enable a systems-level understanding of complex traits; 2) the use of gene co-expression modules to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets; and 3) the ability to identify functionally important players that may be missed by traditional approaches focused on individual genes. By leveraging the concerted actions of genes within specific biological contexts, PhenoPLIER offers a promising path for translating genetic discoveries into new therapies.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped elucidate the role of individual genes, yet modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions are crucial for disease etiology and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Here, we show that this representation, based on modules of co-expressed genes, can accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking direct genetic associations are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, our approach can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies. These findings demonstrate how projecting genetic signals through gene expression patterns can highlight disease etiology and uncover new drug mechanisms, ultimately advancing our understanding of complex traits and accelerating the development of effective therapies.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph.

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models of the architecture of complex traits suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. Here, we show that this representation, based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions, allows us to accurately predict known drug-disease pairs and infer mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, thereby advancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.",

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have provided valuable insights into the roles of individual genes, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in the origin and progression of complex diseases (context). Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis (content). By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets that may have been missed by single-gene strategies (content). Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action (content). Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (content). This work highlights the power of integrating gene expression patterns with genetic and pharmacological data to uncover the complex etiology of diseases and identify novel drug mechanisms (conclusion).",

              "text": "The complex interplay between genes and their regulation is crucial for understanding the mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases. While transcriptome-wide association studies have provided insights into the role of individual genes, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. This novel framework provides a powerful tool for uncovering the complex architecture of gene regulation and its implications for disease and drug discovery.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

However, the architecture of these traits is often complex, involving intricate gene-gene interactions that are not fully captured by traditional single-gene association analyses (context). Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis (content). By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets that may be missed by conventional single-gene strategies (content). Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action (content). Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER (content). This integrated approach highlights the importance of considering gene expression patterns and co-regulation in understanding the etiology of complex traits and identifying novel drug mechanisms (conclusion).",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed genes, allowing PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack individual associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings demonstrate the power of our approach to uncover complex gene-gene interactions and their role in complex traits, paving the way for more effective therapeutic development.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

However, the architecture of these traits is inherently polygenic, with gene-gene interactions playing a crucial role in disease origin and progression. To address this, the field of functional genomics has developed methods to contextualize genetic associations by mapping them to patterns of gene co-expression across diverse conditions (context). Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that jointly models gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data to uncover the modular organization of the transcriptome and its relationship to complex phenotypes (content). We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can accurately predict known drug-disease connections and infer mechanisms of action, while also prioritizing functionally important players missed by single-gene strategies (conclusion). Our results highlight the power of integrating genetic and gene expression data to elucidate the underlying biology of complex traits and identify promising therapeutic targets (broader significance).",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions, which is critical for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nConclusion: The PhenoPLIER approach addresses the gap in current literature by leveraging gene co-expression patterns to contextualize genetic associations and uncover potential therapeutic targets that may have been missed by traditional single-gene analyses. This advancement in understanding the complex interplay of genes and their role in disease mechanisms has broader significance for the development of more effective and personalized therapies.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped elucidate the role of individual genes, modern models suggest that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. This manuscript introduces PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. Here, we leverage modules of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential therapeutic targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lacking direct genetic associations are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the power of integrating gene expression patterns with genetic and pharmacological data to uncover the complex etiology of diseases and identify promising drug repurposing opportunities.",

            "Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.",
