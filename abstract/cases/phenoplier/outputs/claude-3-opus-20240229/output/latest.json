Revise the following abstract of this manuscript.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions, which is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

Correcting spelling and grammar errors (e.g., \"concierto\" to \"concert\", \"specifico\" to \"specific\").\n2. Improving sentence structure and flow (e.g., \"It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.\" was removed as it was redundant).\n3. Ensuring consistent use of abbreviations (e.g., \"significantl\" to \"significantly\").\n4. Maintaining the key points and overall message of the abstract while enhancing its clarity and readability."

          "output": "Deciphering the complex interplay between genes and traits is crucial for understanding disease mechanisms and developing targeted therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes, the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression remains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we show that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes within trait-associated modules, even when they lack individual associations. By considering the context of co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful framework for contextualizing genetic associations, revealing potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies, and ultimately advancing our understanding of complex trait architecture and its implications for drug discovery."

Correcting spelling and grammar errors (e.g., \"concierto\" to \"concert\", \"specifico\" to \"specific\").\n2. Improving sentence structure and flow (e.g., \"It has been shown that this insight is critical\" to \"This insight has been shown to be critical\").\n3. Removing redundant words and phrases (e.g., \"significantl\" to \"significantly\").\n4. Ensuring consistent verb tense usage throughout the abstract.\n\nThese revisions help to improve the overall readability and clarity of the abstract while maintaining its scientific content and message."

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes, the architecture of complex traits suggests that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. However, current approaches lack the ability to integrate gene-trait associations with pharmacological data to uncover novel therapeutic targets. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data into a shared latent space, enabling a joint analysis based on modules of co-expressed genes across relevant conditions. Our approach accurately identifies known drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of action, and prioritizes functionally important genes missed by single-gene strategies, as demonstrated through a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. By leveraging the context of co-expressed gene modules, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential therapeutic targets, advancing our understanding of complex trait biology and facilitating drug repurposing efforts."

          "output": "Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous genetic variants linked to complex traits, but translating these associations into mechanistic insights remains challenging. Gene expression data across diverse conditions can provide a functional context for understanding how genes work together to influence complex traits. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified framework based on gene co-expression modules. By mapping diseases and drug effects onto these modules, PhenoPLIER reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and their mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes within trait-associated modules, even when they lack individual genetic associations. Our results highlight the power of leveraging gene co-expression patterns to contextualize genetic associations, identify potential therapeutic targets, and guide drug repurposing efforts, thereby advancing our understanding of complex trait biology and facilitating the development of new treatments."

Gene expression data across diverse conditions can provide a functional context for understanding how genes work together to influence complex traits. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified framework based on gene co-expression modules. PhenoPLIER reveals that diseases are significantly associated with modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and their mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes within trait-associated modules, even when they lack individual associations. By considering the context of gene co-expression, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful approach for elucidating the etiology of complex traits and identifying potential therapeutic targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies."

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes, the architecture of complex traits suggests that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. However, current approaches lack the ability to integrate gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data, hindering the identification of potential therapeutic targets. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data into a shared latent space, enabling a joint analysis based on modules of co-expressed genes across relevant conditions. Our approach accurately identifies disease-associated gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, predicts known drug-disease pairs, and infers mechanisms of action. Notably, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes within trait-associated modules, even when they lack individual associations. By considering groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential therapeutic targets that single-gene strategies may overlook, thereby advancing our understanding of complex trait architecture and facilitating drug discovery efforts."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions.

This approach reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes within trait-associated modules, even when they lack individual associations. By considering groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and identifies potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. Genes function in concert within specific contexts, and understanding their expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for elucidating their influence on complex traits and developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER addresses this by providing a framework to integrate genetic associations and functional genomics data, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and potential therapeutic targets.\n\nThe revised abstract maintains the key points while improving the overall structure and readability. The first paragraph introduces PhenoPLIER and its main findings, while the second paragraph emphasizes the importance of considering gene-gene interactions and the advantages of PhenoPLIER in addressing this challenge."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph.

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.

This approach reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, and infers mechanisms of action. Applying PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation prioritizes functionally important genes that lack associations but are highlighted in trait-associated modules. By considering groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and identifies potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Genes function in concert within specific contexts, and understanding their expression regulation across conditions is crucial for elucidating their influence on complex traits and developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER addresses this challenge by providing a framework for integrating genetic associations and functional genomics data to gain insights into disease etiology and identify novel therapeutic targets."

Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, thereby advancing our understanding of complex trait architecture and facilitating the development of new therapies."

This joint analysis reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes within trait-associated modules, even when they lack direct associations. By considering groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and identifies potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. As genes function in concert within specific contexts, understanding the regulation of gene expression across different conditions is crucial for elucidating their influence on complex traits and developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and progression.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

This approach reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players within trait-associated modules, even when they lack direct associations. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that single-gene strategies may overlook. Genes function in concert within specific contexts, and understanding their expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for elucidating their influence on complex traits and developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER addresses this by leveraging the power of gene co-expression to provide a more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and potential therapeutic targets."

This approach reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful tool for understanding the complex genetic architecture of diseases and identifying novel therapeutic targets."

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

          "output": "Deciphering the complex interplay between genes and their influence on traits is crucial for understanding disease mechanisms and developing targeted therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes, the architecture of complex traits suggests that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. However, current approaches lack the ability to contextualize genetic associations and identify potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. By leveraging this approach, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we show that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players within trait-associated modules, even when they lack direct associations. Our findings highlight the power of integrating genetic associations with gene co-expression patterns to uncover disease etiology and identify novel therapeutic targets, ultimately advancing our understanding of complex traits and facilitating drug repurposing efforts."

A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes, the importance of gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression remains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we show that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes within trait-associated modules, even when they lack individual associations. By considering the context of co-expressed gene groups, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful framework for contextualizing genetic associations, revealing potential therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies, and ultimately advancing our understanding of complex trait architecture and its implications for drug discovery.",

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players lacking associations in trait-associated modules. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, thereby advancing our understanding of complex trait architecture and facilitating the development of new therapies.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

              "text": "Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous genetic variants linked to complex traits, but translating these associations into mechanistic insights remains challenging. Gene expression data across diverse conditions can provide a functional context for understanding how genes work together to influence complex traits. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified framework based on gene co-expression modules. By mapping diseases and drug effects onto these modules, PhenoPLIER reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and their mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes within trait-associated modules, even when they lack individual genetic associations. Our results highlight the power of leveraging gene co-expression patterns to contextualize genetic associations, identify potential therapeutic targets, and guide drug repurposing efforts, thereby advancing our understanding of complex trait biology and facilitating the development of new treatments.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph.

Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers.

It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.

We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

Gene expression data across diverse conditions can provide a functional context for understanding how genes work together to influence complex traits. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified framework based on gene co-expression modules. PhenoPLIER reveals that diseases are significantly associated with modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and their mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes within trait-associated modules, even when they lack individual associations. By considering the context of gene co-expression, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful approach for elucidating the etiology of complex traits and identifying potential therapeutic targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies.",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes, the architecture of complex traits suggests that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. However, current approaches lack the ability to integrate gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data, hindering the identification of potential therapeutic targets. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data into a shared latent space, enabling a joint analysis based on modules of co-expressed genes across relevant conditions. Our approach accurately identifies disease-associated gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, predicts known drug-disease pairs, and infers mechanisms of action. Notably, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes within trait-associated modules, even when they lack individual associations. By considering groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential therapeutic targets that single-gene strategies may overlook, thereby advancing our understanding of complex trait architecture and facilitating drug discovery efforts.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.

We observe that diseases are significantl associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.

This approach reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes within trait-associated modules, even when they lack individual associations. By considering groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and identifies potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. Genes function in concert within specific contexts, and understanding their expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for elucidating their influence on complex traits and developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER addresses this by providing a framework to integrate genetic associations and functional genomics data, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and potential therapeutic targets.\n\nThe revised abstract maintains the key points while improving the overall structure and readability.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. However, current approaches lack the ability to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can provide a more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and identify potential therapeutic targets, moving the field of complex trait genetics forward.",

This joint analysis reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes within trait-associated modules, even when they lack direct associations. By considering groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and identifies potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. As genes function in concert within specific contexts, understanding the regulation of gene expression across different conditions is crucial for elucidating their influence on complex traits and developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER addresses this challenge by providing a framework for integrating genetic associations and functional genomics data to gain insights into disease etiology and identify novel therapeutic targets.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis.

Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. However, determining how these interactions influence complex traits remains a challenge. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, thereby advancing our understanding of complex traits and facilitating the development of new therapies.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions.

Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, thereby advancing our understanding of disease etiology and facilitating the identification of novel therapeutic targets.",

Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. By incorporating these gene modules, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. PhenoPLIER's joint analysis of gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data provides a more comprehensive understanding of gene expression regulation in complex traits, facilitating the development of new therapies.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.

To fully understand how genes influence complex traits and develop new therapies, it is critical to determine how groups of genes are regulated and expressed in concert across different conditions. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players within trait-associated modules that lack associations when considered individually. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, thereby advancing our understanding of complex trait architecture and facilitating the development of new therapies.",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes, the architecture of complex traits suggests that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. However, current approaches lack the ability to contextualize genetic associations and identify potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies.

Moreover, through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we show that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players within trait-associated modules, even when they lack direct associations. Our findings highlight the power of integrating genetic associations with gene co-expression patterns to uncover disease etiology and identify novel therapeutic targets, ultimately advancing our understanding of complex traits and facilitating drug repurposing efforts.",

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

This insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. By incorporating these gene modules, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results demonstrate the power of integrating co-expression networks with genetic associations to elucidate disease etiology and identify novel therapeutic targets.\n\nThe revised abstract maintains the key points while improving the overall structure and readability.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions, enabling a joint analysis that contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players lacking associations within trait-associated modules, demonstrating its ability to move the field forward by identifying novel targets and mechanisms.",

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease, the architecture of complex traits suggests that gene-gene interactions are also critical in disease origin and progression. However, current approaches lack the ability to contextualize genetic associations and identify potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes. By incorporating these gene modules, PhenoPLIER reveals that diseases are significantly associated with modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players within trait-associated modules, even when they lack individual associations. Our approach bridges the gap between genetic associations and disease mechanisms, providing a powerful tool for identifying novel therapeutic targets and advancing our understanding of complex trait architecture.",

Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

Revise the following abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.\n\nRevised paragraph:",
