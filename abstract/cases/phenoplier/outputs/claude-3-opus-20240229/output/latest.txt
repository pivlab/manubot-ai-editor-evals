          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concierto with each other in specifico
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantl
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.

          The main changes include:

          1. Correcting spelling and grammar errors (e.g., "concierto" to
          "concert", "specifico" to "specific").

          2. Improving sentence structure and flow (e.g., "It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies." was
          removed as it was redundant).

          3. Ensuring consistent use of abbreviations (e.g., "significantl" to
          "significantly").

          4. Maintaining the key points and overall message of the abstract
          while enhancing its clarity and readability.

          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in

          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the

          Deciphering the complex interplay between genes and traits is crucial
          for understanding disease mechanisms and developing targeted
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed
          light on the role of individual genes, the importance of gene-gene
          interactions in disease etiology and progression remains largely
          unexplored. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational
          approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a unified latent representation based on
          modules of co-expressed genes. Our results demonstrate that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen
          for lipid regulation, we show that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
          important genes within trait-associated modules, even when they lack
          individual associations. By considering the context of co-expressed
          gene groups, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful framework for
          contextualizing genetic associations, revealing potential therapeutic
          targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies, and
          ultimately advancing our understanding of complex trait architecture
          and its implications for drug discovery.

          Gene regulation is a complex process involving interactions between
          multiple genes in specific contexts. Understanding these interactions
          is crucial for developing new therapies, but current methods focus on
          individual gene-trait associations, missing the critical role of
          gene-gene interactions in disease origin and progression. Here we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that jointly analyzes
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data by
          mapping them into a common latent representation based on modules of
          co-expressed genes. We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately
          identifies disease-associated gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, predicts known drug-disease pairs, and infers mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we
          show that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes missed
          by single-gene strategies. By incorporating gene-gene interactions,
          PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential
          therapeutic targets, advancing our understanding of complex trait
          architecture and facilitating the development of new treatments.

          Here is a revised version of the abstract with improved grammar,
          clarity, and flow:


          Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
          their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. This insight has been shown to be critical for
          developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.


          The main changes include:


          1. Correcting spelling and grammar errors (e.g., "concierto" to
          "concert", "specifico" to "specific").

          2. Improving sentence structure and flow (e.g., "It has been shown
          that this insight is critical" to "This insight has been shown to be
          critical").

          3. Removing redundant words and phrases (e.g., "significantl" to
          "significantly").

          4. Ensuring consistent verb tense usage throughout the abstract.


          These revisions help to improve the overall readability and clarity of
          the abstract while maintaining its scientific content and message.

          Deciphering the complex interplay between genes and their influence on
          traits is crucial for understanding disease mechanisms and developing
          targeted therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the role of individual genes, the architecture of
          complex traits suggests that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal
          role in disease etiology and progression. However, current approaches
          lack the ability to integrate gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological data to uncover novel therapeutic targets. Here we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps gene-trait
          associations and drug perturbation data into a shared latent space,
          enabling a joint analysis based on modules of co-expressed genes
          across relevant conditions. Our approach accurately identifies known
          drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of action, and prioritizes
          functionally important genes missed by single-gene strategies, as
          demonstrated through a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. By
          leveraging the context of co-expressed gene modules, PhenoPLIER
          contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential therapeutic
          targets, advancing our understanding of complex trait biology and
          facilitating drug repurposing efforts.

          Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous genetic
          variants linked to complex traits, but translating these associations
          into mechanistic insights remains challenging. Gene expression data
          across diverse conditions can provide a functional context for
          understanding how genes work together to influence complex traits.
          Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified framework based on gene co-expression modules. By
          mapping diseases and drug effects onto these modules, PhenoPLIER
          reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and their mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a
          CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER
          prioritizes functionally important genes within trait-associated
          modules, even when they lack individual genetic associations. Our
          results highlight the power of leveraging gene co-expression patterns
          to contextualize genetic associations, identify potential therapeutic
          targets, and guide drug repurposing efforts, thereby advancing our
          understanding of complex trait biology and facilitating the
          development of new treatments.

          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across

          approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
          inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets

          clarity, and flow:


          Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
          their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
          requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
          different conditions. This insight has been shown to be critical for
          developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have
          helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex
          traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
          disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes
          with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts
          known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
          using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
          functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
          in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations

          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in

          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed

          Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous genetic
          variants linked to complex traits, but translating these associations
          into mechanistic insights remains challenging. Gene expression data
          across diverse conditions can provide a functional context for
          understanding how genes work together to influence complex traits.
          Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that
          integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a unified framework based on gene co-expression modules.
          PhenoPLIER reveals that diseases are significantly associated with
          modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and their mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a
          CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER
          prioritizes functionally important genes within trait-associated
          modules, even when they lack individual associations. By considering
          the context of gene co-expression, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful
          approach for elucidating the etiology of complex traits and
          identifying potential therapeutic targets that may be missed by
          single-gene strategies.

          therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the
          role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
          modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies.


          The main changes are:

          1. Corrected spelling and grammar errors ("concierto" to "concert",
          "specifico" to "specific").

          2. Removed redundant words and phrases to improve clarity and
          conciseness ("significantl" to "significantly").

          3. Improved sentence structure and flow for better readability.


          The revised abstract maintains the key points and findings while
          improving the overall quality of the writing.

          Deciphering the complex interplay between genes and their influence on
          traits is crucial for understanding disease mechanisms and developing
          targeted therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the role of individual genes, the architecture of
          complex traits suggests that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal
          role in disease etiology and progression. However, current approaches
          lack the ability to integrate gene-trait associations with
          pharmacological perturbation data, hindering the identification of
          potential therapeutic targets. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational method that maps gene-trait associations and drug
          perturbation data into a shared latent space, enabling a joint
          analysis based on modules of co-expressed genes across relevant
          conditions. Our approach accurately identifies disease-associated gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, predicts known drug-disease
          pairs, and infers mechanisms of action. Notably, using a CRISPR screen
          for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes
          functionally important genes within trait-associated modules, even
          when they lack individual associations. By considering groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and
          uncovers potential therapeutic targets that single-gene strategies may
          overlook, thereby advancing our understanding of complex trait
          architecture and facilitating drug discovery efforts.

          Here is a revised version of the abstract with improved clarity and
          flow:


          PhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          shared latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes
          across various conditions. This approach reveals that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and their
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen for lipid
          regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
          important genes within trait-associated modules, even when they lack
          individual associations. By considering groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and identifies
          potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies.
          Genes function in concert within specific contexts, and understanding
          their expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for
          elucidating their influence on complex traits and developing new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered
          the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern
          models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a critical role in disease origin and progression.
          PhenoPLIER addresses this by providing a framework to integrate
          genetic associations and functional genomics data, enabling a more
          comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and potential
          therapeutic targets.


          The revised abstract maintains the key points while improving the
          overall structure and readability. The first paragraph introduces
          PhenoPLIER and its main findings, while the second paragraph
          emphasizes the importance of considering gene-gene interactions and
          the advantages of PhenoPLIER in addressing this challenge.

          Here is the revised abstract:


          PhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          shared latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes
          across diverse conditions. This approach reveals significant
          associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, and infers
          mechanisms of action. Applying PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen for lipid
          regulation prioritizes functionally important genes that lack
          associations but are highlighted in trait-associated modules. By
          considering groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes
          genetic associations and identifies potential targets overlooked by
          single-gene strategies. Genes function in concert within specific
          contexts, and understanding their expression regulation across
          conditions is crucial for elucidating their influence on complex
          traits and developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association
          studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models of complex trait
          architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical role
          in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER addresses this challenge
          by providing a framework for integrating genetic associations and
          functional genomics data to gain insights into disease etiology and
          identify novel therapeutic targets.

          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed

          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene

          Here is a revised version of the abstract with improved clarity and
          flow:


          PhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          shared latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes
          across various conditions. This joint analysis reveals that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER
          prioritizes functionally important genes within trait-associated
          modules, even when they lack direct associations. By considering
          groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic
          associations and identifies potential targets that may be overlooked
          by single-gene strategies. As genes function in concert within
          specific contexts, understanding the regulation of gene expression
          across different conditions is crucial for elucidating their influence
          on complex traits and developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of
          complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a
          critical role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER addresses
          this challenge by providing a framework for integrating genetic
          associations and functional genomics data to gain insights into
          disease etiology and identify novel therapeutic targets.

          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          Here is a revised version of the abstract with improved clarity and
          flow:


          PhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          shared latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes
          across the same conditions. This approach reveals that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and their
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes
          functionally important players within trait-associated modules, even
          when they lack direct associations. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and
          uncovers potential targets that single-gene strategies may overlook.
          Genes function in concert within specific contexts, and understanding
          their expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for
          elucidating their influence on complex traits and developing new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped
          uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms,
          modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a critical role in disease origin and progression.
          PhenoPLIER addresses this by leveraging the power of gene
          co-expression to provide a more comprehensive understanding of disease
          etiology and potential therapeutic targets.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          Here is a revised version of the abstract with improved clarity and
          flow:


          PhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          shared latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes
          across various conditions. This approach reveals that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes
          functionally important genes within trait-associated modules, even
          when they lack direct associations. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and
          identifies potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene
          strategies. 


          Genes function in concert within specific contexts, and understanding
          the regulation of their expression across different conditions is
          crucial for elucidating their influence on complex traits and
          developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies
          have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
          mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture predict that
          gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and
          progression. PhenoPLIER addresses this by leveraging the power of
          co-expression modules to provide a more comprehensive understanding of
          disease etiology and potential therapeutic targets.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint
          analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
          similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
          that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
          known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
          Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
          find that functionally important players lack associations but are
          prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in
          specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these
          genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.

          Here is a revised version of the abstract with improved clarity and
          flow:


          Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions,
          and understanding how they influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions. This insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models of
          complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a

          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same
          conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important
          players in trait-associated modules that lack associations in
          single-gene strategies. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential
          targets missed by single-gene approaches, highlighting its potential
          for uncovering disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          abstract of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure
          and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          Here is a revised version of the abstract with improved clarity and

          Genes interact with each other in specific contexts to perform their
          functions, and understanding these interactions is crucial for
          elucidating the genetic basis of complex traits and developing new
          therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered
          the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern
          models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a critical role in disease origin and progression.
          Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes
          across the same conditions. This joint analysis allows PhenoPLIER to
          contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed
          by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers

          lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          provides a powerful tool for understanding the complex genetic
          architecture of diseases and identifying novel therapeutic targets.

          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in

          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          Gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in the origin and
          progression of complex traits and diseases, but current approaches for
          identifying disease-relevant genes and drug targets focus primarily on
          individual genes. To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational method that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          based on modules of co-expressed genes. Using this approach, we
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and that PhenoPLIER
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, in a CRISPR screen of lipid regulation, we find
          that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes that lack
          associations in single-gene analyses. By incorporating gene
          co-expression patterns, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations
          and reveals potential therapeutic targets that may be missed by
          current approaches, thus providing a more comprehensive understanding
          of disease etiology and facilitating the development of new therapies.

          Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to
          perform their biological roles. Understanding how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions, which is critical
          for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait
          architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions.
          This joint analysis allows for the contextualization of genetic
          associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of

          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          provides a powerful tool for understanding disease etiology and
          identifying novel therapeutic targets.

          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          Understanding the complex interplay between genes and their influence
          on traits requires a mechanistic view of expression regulation across
          diverse contexts, which is crucial for developing novel therapies.
          While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role
          of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of
          complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a
          pivotal role in disease origin and progression. However, current
          single-gene strategies fail to fully capture these interactions and
          their potential as therapeutic targets. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER,
          a computational approach that jointly analyzes gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data by mapping them into a common
          latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes across
          the same conditions. By incorporating these gene modules, PhenoPLIER
          contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Our findings demonstrate the power of integrating
          co-expression information with genetic associations to uncover novel
          disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets, paving the way
          for more effective drug discovery and repurposing strategies.

          Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to
          perform their biological roles. Understanding how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions, which is critical
          for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
          studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait
          architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role
          in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions.
          This joint analysis allows for the contextualization of genetic
          associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of

          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
          provides a powerful tool for understanding disease etiology and
          identifying novel therapeutic targets.

          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in
          predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that functionally important players lack
          associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach
          that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation
          data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
          representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
          patterns across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
          co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations
          and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

          Gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in the origin and
          progression of complex traits and diseases, but current
          transcriptome-wide association studies primarily focus on the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. To fully understand
          how genes influence complex traits and develop new therapies, it is
          critical to determine how groups of genes are regulated and expressed
          in concert across different conditions. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER,
          a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
          pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation
          based on modules of co-expressed genes. We demonstrate that diseases
          are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
          cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease
          pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that PhenoPLIER
          prioritizes functionally important players within trait-associated
          modules that lack associations when considered individually. By
          incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes
          genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies, thereby advancing our understanding of complex
          trait architecture and facilitating the development of new therapies.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the

          Gene regulation is a complex process involving interactions between

          Changes made:

          1. Removed the first two sentences and combined their key points into
          a more concise opening sentence.

          2. Rearranged the order of information to improve the logical flow and
          clarity of the abstract.

          3. Removed the sentence "It has been shown that this insight is
          critical for developing new therapies" as it is implied in the context
          of the abstract.

          4. Moved the introduction of PhenoPLIER earlier in the abstract to

          Deciphering the complex interplay between genes and their influence on
          traits is crucial for understanding disease mechanisms and developing
          targeted therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
          shed light on the role of individual genes, the architecture of
          complex traits suggests that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal
          role in disease etiology and progression. However, current approaches
          lack the ability to contextualize genetic associations and identify
          potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. Here
          we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          shared latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes
          across the same conditions. By leveraging this approach, we
          demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately
          predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
          Moreover, through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we show
          that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players within
          trait-associated modules, even when they lack direct associations. Our
          findings highlight the power of integrating genetic associations with
          gene co-expression patterns to uncover disease etiology and identify
          novel therapeutic targets, ultimately advancing our understanding of
          complex traits and facilitating drug repurposing efforts.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the

          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          Gene regulation orchestrates complex traits, and understanding its
          mechanisms is critical for developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of
          individual genes in disease, the importance of gene-gene interactions
          in disease origin and progression remains understudied. Here we
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation based on co-expressed gene modules. By
          incorporating these modules, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic
          associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. We demonstrate that diseases significantly associate with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we
          show that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes lacking
          individual associations within trait-associated modules. PhenoPLIER's
          ability to identify disease-relevant gene interactions and drug
          targets through co-expression analysis opens new avenues for
          understanding complex traits and developing targeted therapies.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is

          Gene regulation is a complex process that involves the coordinated
          expression of multiple genes across different conditions.
          Understanding how these genes interact to influence complex traits is
          crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have identified the role of individual genes in
          disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene

          Here is a revised version of the abstract with improved clarity and
          flow:


          Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions,
          and understanding how they influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions. This insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
          associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
          latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes across
          the same conditions. By incorporating these gene modules, PhenoPLIER
          contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players
          lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by
          PhenoPLIER. Our results demonstrate the power of integrating
          co-expression networks with genetic associations to elucidate disease
          etiology and identify novel therapeutic targets.


          The revised abstract maintains the key points while improving the
          overall structure and readability. The connections between ideas are
          more explicit, and the significance of the work is emphasized in the
          concluding sentence.

          Determining how genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across different conditions,
          which is critical for developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of
          complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a
          crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same
          conditions. By incorporating these modules, PhenoPLIER contextualizes
          genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by
          single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
          approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
          mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze
          lipid regulation, we find that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
          important players lacking associations within trait-associated
          modules. Our results demonstrate the power of integrating
          co-expression patterns with genetic associations to uncover disease
          etiology and identify novel therapeutic targets, advancing the field
          of complex trait genetics and drug discovery.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          Here is a revised version of the abstract with improved clarity and
          flow:


          Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their functions,
          and understanding how they influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          conditions. This insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role
          of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of
          complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a
          crucial role in disease origin and progression. We introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same
          conditions. By incorporating these gene modules, PhenoPLIER
          contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets
          missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs
          and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation, we find that PhenoPLIER prioritizes
          functionally important players within trait-associated modules, even
          when they lack individual associations. Our results demonstrate the
          power of integrating co-expression information with genetic
          associations to elucidate disease etiology and identify novel
          therapeutic targets.

          Gene regulation plays a crucial role in determining how genes
          influence complex traits, and understanding these mechanisms is
          essential for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
          association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in
          disease, the architecture of complex traits suggests that gene-gene
          interactions are also critical in disease origin and progression.
          However, current approaches lack the ability to contextualize genetic
          associations and identify potential targets that may be missed by
          single-gene strategies. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
          approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
          perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules
          of co-expressed genes. By incorporating these gene modules, PhenoPLIER
          reveals that diseases are significantly associated with modules
          expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known
          drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using

          PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players within
          trait-associated modules, even when they lack individual associations.
          Our approach bridges the gap between genetic associations and disease
          mechanisms, providing a powerful tool for identifying novel
          therapeutic targets and advancing our understanding of complex trait
          architecture.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          Understanding how genes influence complex traits requires a
          mechanistic view of expression regulation across different conditions,
          which is critical for developing new therapies. While
          transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of
          complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a
          crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce
          PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations
          and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
          representation based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same
          conditions, enabling a joint analysis that contextualizes genetic
          associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene
          strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
          accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of
          action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation, we find that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important
          players within trait-associated modules, even when they lack
          individual associations. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
          genes, PhenoPLIER moves the field forward by providing a more
          comprehensive understanding of the complex genetic architecture
          underlying diseases and facilitating the identification of novel
          therapeutic targets.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
          contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
          that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
          Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of
          individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
          models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene
          interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression.
          Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
          gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
          common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation
          is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
          the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
          PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
          targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease
          pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally
          important players lack associations but are prioritized in
          trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

          understanding of complex traits, ultimately facilitating the
          development of targeted therapies.

              Here is a revised version of the abstract with improved language
              and flow:


              Genes act in concert within specific contexts to perform their
              functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits
              requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions, which is critical for developing new
              therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered
              the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms.
              However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits
              predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
              origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on
              modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same
              conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and
              reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.


              The main changes include:

              1. Correcting spelling and grammar errors (e.g., "concierto" to
              "concert", "specifico" to "specific").

              2. Improving sentence structure and flow (e.g., "It has been shown
              that this insight is critical for developing new therapies." was
              removed as it was redundant).

              3. Ensuring consistent use of abbreviations (e.g., "significantl"
              to "significantly").

              4. Maintaining the key points and overall message of the abstract
              while enhancing its clarity and readability.

              Deciphering the complex interplay between genes and traits is
              crucial for understanding disease mechanisms and developing
              targeted therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies
              have shed light on the role of individual genes, the importance of
              gene-gene interactions in disease etiology and progression remains
              largely unexplored. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
              computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent
              representation based on modules of co-expressed genes. Our results
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation,
              we show that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes
              within trait-associated modules, even when they lack individual
              associations. By considering the context of co-expressed gene
              groups, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful framework for
              contextualizing genetic associations, revealing potential
              therapeutic targets that may be overlooked by single-gene
              strategies, and ultimately advancing our understanding of complex
              trait architecture and its implications for drug discovery.

              Gene regulation is a complex process involving interactions
              between multiple genes in specific contexts. Understanding these
              interactions is crucial for developing new therapies, but current
              methods focus on individual gene-trait associations, missing the
              critical role of gene-gene interactions in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that jointly analyzes gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data by mapping them into a common
              latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes. We

              disease-associated gene modules expressed in relevant cell types,
              predicts known drug-disease pairs, and infers mechanisms of

              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to
              perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence
              complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression
              regulation across different conditions. This insight has been

              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and

              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can
              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies.


              The main changes include:


              1. Correcting spelling and grammar errors (e.g., "concierto" to
              "concert", "specifico" to "specific").

              2. Improving sentence structure and flow (e.g., "It has been shown
              that this insight is critical" to "This insight has been shown to
              be critical").

              3. Removing redundant words and phrases (e.g., "significantl" to
              "significantly").

              4. Ensuring consistent verb tense usage throughout the abstract.


              These revisions help to improve the overall readability and
              clarity of the abstract while maintaining its scientific content
              and message.

              Deciphering the complex interplay between genes and their
              influence on traits is crucial for understanding disease
              mechanisms and developing targeted therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of individual genes, the architecture of complex traits suggests
              that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease
              etiology and progression. However, current approaches lack the
              ability to integrate gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              data to uncover novel therapeutic targets. Here we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps gene-trait
              associations and drug perturbation data into a shared latent
              space, enabling a joint analysis based on modules of co-expressed
              genes across relevant conditions. Our approach accurately
              identifies known drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of action,
              and prioritizes functionally important genes missed by single-gene
              strategies, as demonstrated through a CRISPR screen for lipid
              regulation. By leveraging the context of co-expressed gene
              modules, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and
              uncovers potential therapeutic targets, advancing our
              understanding of complex trait biology and facilitating drug
              repurposing efforts.

              Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous genetic
              variants linked to complex traits, but translating these
              associations into mechanistic insights remains challenging. Gene
              expression data across diverse conditions can provide a functional
              context for understanding how genes work together to influence
              complex traits. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a unified framework based
              on gene co-expression modules. By mapping diseases and drug
              effects onto these modules, PhenoPLIER reveals that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              their mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for
              lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes
              functionally important genes within trait-associated modules, even
              when they lack individual genetic associations. Our results
              highlight the power of leveraging gene co-expression patterns to
              contextualize genetic associations, identify potential therapeutic
              targets, and guide drug repurposing efforts, thereby advancing our
              understanding of complex trait biology and facilitating the
              development of new treatments.

              Gene regulation is a complex process involving the coordinated
              expression of multiple genes across different conditions, and
              understanding this process is critical for developing new
              therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have

              Gene regulation is a complex process that involves the coordinated
              expression of multiple genes across different conditions.
              Understanding how these genes interact to influence complex traits
              is critical for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex
              traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in
              disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation based on modules of co-expressed genes. We
              demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
              important players within trait-associated modules, even when they
              lack individual associations. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations
              and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies,
              thereby advancing our understanding of complex trait architecture
              and facilitating the development of targeted therapies.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to

              The main changes are:

              1. Corrected spelling and grammar errors ("concierto" to
              "concert", "specifico" to "specific").

              2. Removed redundant words and phrases to improve clarity and
              conciseness ("significantl" to "significantly").

              3. Improved sentence structure and flow for better readability.


              The revised abstract maintains the key points and findings while
              improving the overall quality of the writing.

              Deciphering the complex interplay between genes and their
              influence on traits is crucial for understanding disease
              mechanisms and developing targeted therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of individual genes, the architecture of complex traits suggests
              that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease
              etiology and progression. However, current approaches lack the
              ability to integrate gene-trait associations with pharmacological
              perturbation data, hindering the identification of potential
              therapeutic targets. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              method that maps gene-trait associations and drug perturbation
              data into a shared latent space, enabling a joint analysis based
              on modules of co-expressed genes across relevant conditions. Our
              approach accurately identifies disease-associated gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, predicts known drug-disease
              pairs, and infers mechanisms of action. Notably, using a CRISPR
              screen for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER
              prioritizes functionally important genes within trait-associated
              modules, even when they lack individual associations. By
              considering groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
              contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential
              therapeutic targets that single-gene strategies may overlook,
              thereby advancing our understanding of complex trait architecture

              Gene expression is a complex process involving the coordinated
              action of multiple genes in specific contexts. Understanding how
              these genes influence complex traits is crucial for developing new

              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              Here is a revised version of the abstract with improved clarity
              and flow:


              PhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a shared latent representation based on modules of co-expressed
              genes across various conditions. This approach reveals that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
              screen for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER
              prioritizes functionally important genes within trait-associated
              modules, even when they lack individual associations. By
              considering groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
              contextualizes genetic associations and identifies potential
              targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. Genes
              function in concert within specific contexts, and understanding
              their expression regulation across different conditions is crucial
              for elucidating their influence on complex traits and developing
              new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture predict
              that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin
              and progression. PhenoPLIER addresses this by providing a
              framework to integrate genetic associations and functional
              genomics data, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of
              disease etiology and potential therapeutic targets.


              The revised abstract maintains the key points while improving the
              overall structure and readability. The first paragraph introduces
              PhenoPLIER and its main findings, while the second paragraph
              emphasizes the importance of considering gene-gene interactions
              and the advantages of PhenoPLIER in addressing this challenge.

            Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
            gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a
            common latent representation for a joint analysis. This
            representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression
            patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are
            significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
            cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known
            drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
            using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
            functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized
            in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups
            of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
            associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
            strategies. Genes act in concert with each other in specific
            contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
            influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
            expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown
            that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
            Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role
            of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern
            models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene

              Here is the revised abstract:


              PhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a shared latent representation based on modules of co-expressed
              genes across diverse conditions. This approach reveals significant
              associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs,
              and infers mechanisms of action. Applying PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR
              screen for lipid regulation prioritizes functionally important
              genes that lack associations but are highlighted in
              trait-associated modules. By considering groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and
              identifies potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.
              Genes function in concert within specific contexts, and
              understanding their expression regulation across conditions is
              crucial for elucidating their influence on complex traits and
              developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, but modern models of complex trait architecture
              predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in
              disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER addresses this
              challenge by providing a framework for integrating genetic
              associations and functional genomics data to gain insights into
              disease etiology and identify novel therapeutic targets.

              a shared latent representation based on modules of co-expressed
              genes across various conditions. This joint analysis reveals that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that
              PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes within
              trait-associated modules, even when they lack direct associations.
              By considering groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
              contextualizes genetic associations and identifies potential
              targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. As genes
              function in concert within specific contexts, understanding the
              regulation of gene expression across different conditions is
              crucial for elucidating their influence on complex traits and
              developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait
              architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical
              role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER addresses this
              challenge by providing a framework for integrating genetic
              associations and functional genomics data to gain insights into
              disease etiology and identify novel therapeutic targets.

              Here is a revised version of the abstract with improved clarity
              and flow:


              PhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a shared latent representation based on modules of co-expressed
              genes across the same conditions. This approach reveals that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and their mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER
              prioritizes functionally important players within trait-associated
              modules, even when they lack direct associations. By incorporating
              groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic
              associations and uncovers potential targets that single-gene
              strategies may overlook. Genes function in concert within specific
              contexts, and understanding their expression regulation across
              different conditions is crucial for elucidating their influence on
              complex traits and developing new therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern
              models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a critical role in disease origin and
              progression. PhenoPLIER addresses this by leveraging the power of
              gene co-expression to provide a more comprehensive understanding
              of disease etiology and potential therapeutic targets.

              Determining how genes influence complex traits requires a
              mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across
              different conditions, which is critical for developing new
              therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, modern models of the architecture of complex traits
              predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
              origin and progression. However, current approaches lack the
              ability to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential
              targets missed by single-gene strategies. Here we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation based on modules of genes with similar
              expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
              contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies, thereby advancing our
              understanding of complex trait architecture and facilitating the
              development of new therapies.

              Here is a revised version of the abstract with improved clarity
              and flow:


              PhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach that integrates
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a shared latent representation based on modules of co-expressed
              genes across various conditions. This approach reveals that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, and accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR
              screen to analyze lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER
              prioritizes functionally important genes within trait-associated
              modules, even when they lack direct associations. By incorporating
              groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic
              associations and identifies potential targets that may be
              overlooked by single-gene strategies. 


              Genes function in concert within specific contexts, and
              understanding the regulation of their expression across different
              conditions is crucial for elucidating their influence on complex
              traits and developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait
              architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical
              role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER addresses this
              by leveraging the power of co-expression modules to provide a more
              comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and potential
              therapeutic targets.

              and flow:


              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits
              requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions. This insight is critical for
              developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, but modern models of complex trait architecture
              predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
              origin and progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation based on
              modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. We
              observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER
              accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms
              of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation, we find that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
              important players in trait-associated modules that lack
              associations in single-gene strategies. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations
              and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene approaches,
              highlighting its potential for uncovering disease etiology and
              drug mechanisms.

              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: Genes act in concert with each other in specific
              contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions. It has been
              shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies.
              Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the
              role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However,
              modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and
              progression. We observe that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and
              inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen
              to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based
              on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the
              same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
              PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

              Genes interact with each other in specific contexts to perform
              their functions, and understanding these interactions is crucial
              for elucidating the genetic basis of complex traits and developing
              new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have
              uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture predict
              that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin
              and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation based on
              modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. This
              joint analysis allows PhenoPLIER to contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed
              genes, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful tool for understanding the
              complex genetic architecture of diseases and identifying novel
              therapeutic targets.

              Gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in the origin and
              progression of complex traits and diseases, but current approaches
              for identifying disease-relevant genes and drug targets focus
              primarily on individual genes. To address this gap, we introduce

              current approaches, thus providing a more comprehensive

              Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to
              perform their biological roles. Understanding how these genes
              influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of
              expression regulation across different conditions, which is
              critical for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex
              trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a
              crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes
              across the same conditions. This joint analysis allows for the
              contextualization of genetic associations and reveals potential
              targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases
              are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a
              powerful tool for understanding disease etiology and identifying
              novel therapeutic targets.

              Understanding the complex interplay between genes and their
              influence on traits requires a mechanistic view of expression
              regulation across diverse contexts, which is crucial for
              developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait
              architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal
              role in disease origin and progression. However, current
              single-gene strategies fail to fully capture these interactions
              and their potential as therapeutic targets. Here we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that jointly analyzes
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data by
              mapping them into a common latent representation based on modules
              of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. By incorporating
              these gene modules, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations
              and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We
              observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach

              co-expression information with genetic associations to uncover
              novel disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets, paving
              the way for more effective drug discovery and repurposing
              strategies.

              expression regulation across different conditions, which is
              critical for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have helped uncover the role of individual
              genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex
              trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a
              crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes
              across the same conditions. This joint analysis allows for the
              contextualization of genetic associations and reveals potential
              targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases
              are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a
              powerful tool for understanding disease etiology and identifying
              novel therapeutic targets.

              Gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in the origin and
              progression of complex traits and diseases, but current
              transcriptome-wide association studies primarily focus on the role
              of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. To fully
              understand how genes influence complex traits and develop new
              therapies, it is critical to determine how groups of genes are
              regulated and expressed in concert across different conditions.
              Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps
              gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into
              a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed
              genes. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that PhenoPLIER prioritizes
              functionally important players within trait-associated modules
              that lack associations when considered individually. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
              contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies, thereby advancing our
              understanding of complex trait architecture and facilitating the
              development of new therapies.

              Gene regulation is a complex process involving interactions

              Changes made:

              1. Removed the first two sentences and combined their key points
              into a more concise opening sentence.

              2. Rearranged the order of information to improve the logical flow
              and clarity of the abstract.

              3. Removed the sentence "It has been shown that this insight is
              critical for developing new therapies" as it is implied in the
              context of the abstract.

              4. Moved the introduction of PhenoPLIER earlier in the abstract to
              provide context for the subsequent information.

              5. Minor grammatical and stylistic changes to improve readability
              and coherence.

              Deciphering the complex interplay between genes and their
              influence on traits is crucial for understanding disease
              mechanisms and developing targeted therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role
              of individual genes, the architecture of complex traits suggests
              that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease
              etiology and progression. However, current approaches lack the
              ability to contextualize genetic associations and identify
              potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies.
              Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that
              integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a shared latent representation based on
              modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. By
              leveraging this approach, we demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease
              pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR
              screen focused on lipid regulation, we show that PhenoPLIER
              prioritizes functionally important players within trait-associated
              modules, even when they lack direct associations. Our findings
              highlight the power of integrating genetic associations with gene
              co-expression patterns to uncover disease etiology and identify
              novel therapeutic targets, ultimately advancing our understanding
              of complex traits and facilitating drug repurposing efforts.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their

              Gene regulation orchestrates complex traits, and understanding its
              mechanisms is critical for developing new therapies. While
              transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of
              individual genes in disease, the importance of gene-gene
              interactions in disease origin and progression remains
              understudied. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation based on co-expressed gene modules. By
              incorporating these modules, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic
              associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. We demonstrate that diseases significantly associate
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen for lipid
              regulation, we show that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally
              important genes lacking individual associations within
              trait-associated modules. PhenoPLIER's ability to identify
              disease-relevant gene interactions and drug targets through
              co-expression analysis opens new avenues for understanding complex

              Gene regulation is a complex process that involves the coordinated
              expression of multiple genes across different conditions.
              Understanding how these genes interact to influence complex traits
              is crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have identified the role of individual genes
              in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that
              gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and
              progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that integrates gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation based on modules of co-expressed genes. By
              incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER
              contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results
              highlight the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in
              understanding complex traits and demonstrate the potential of
              PhenoPLIER in uncovering novel therapeutic targets.

              Here is a revised version of the abstract with improved clarity
              and flow:


              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits
              requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions. This insight is critical for
              developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms. However, modern models of complex trait architecture
              predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
              origin and progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation based on
              modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. By
              incorporating these gene modules, PhenoPLIER contextualizes
              genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by
              single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and
              our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results demonstrate the power of
              integrating co-expression networks with genetic associations to
              elucidate disease etiology and identify novel therapeutic targets.


              The revised abstract maintains the key points while improving the
              overall structure and readability. The connections between ideas
              are more explicit, and the significance of the work is emphasized
              in the concluding sentence.

              Gene expression regulation across different conditions is crucial
              for understanding how genes influence complex traits and
              developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene
              interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and

              perturbation data into a common latent representation based on
              modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. By
              incorporating these modules, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic
              associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to

              functionally important players lacking associations within
              trait-associated modules. PhenoPLIER's ability to uncover
              gene-gene interactions and their role in disease mechanisms
              advances our understanding of complex traits and facilitates the
              development of targeted therapies.

              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits
              requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions. This insight is critical for
              developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms. However, modern models of complex trait architecture
              predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
              origin and progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation based on
              modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. By
              incorporating these co-expression modules, PhenoPLIER
              contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,

              functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our results
              demonstrate the power of integrating co-expression information
              with genetic associations to gain insights into disease etiology
              and identify novel therapeutic targets.

              Gene regulation is a complex process involving the coordinated
              expression of multiple genes across different conditions, and
              understanding these interactions is crucial for developing new

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following abstract
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with
              similar expression patterns across the same conditions. By

              contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant

              find that functionally important players lack associations but are
              prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

              and flow:


              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits
              requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions. This insight is critical for
              developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait
              architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial
              role in disease origin and progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and
              pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent
              representation based on modules of co-expressed genes across the
              same conditions. By incorporating these gene modules, PhenoPLIER
              contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets
              missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known
              drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore,
              using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that
              PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players within
              trait-associated modules, even when they lack individual
              associations. Our results demonstrate the power of integrating
              co-expression information with genetic associations to elucidate
              disease etiology and identify novel therapeutic targets.

              Gene regulation plays a crucial role in determining how genes
              influence complex traits, and understanding these mechanisms is
              essential for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide
              association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in
              disease, the architecture of complex traits suggests that
              gene-gene interactions are also critical in disease origin and
              progression. However, current approaches lack the ability to
              contextualize genetic associations and identify potential targets
              that may be missed by single-gene strategies. Here we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
              latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes. By
              incorporating these gene modules, PhenoPLIER reveals that diseases
              are significantly associated with modules expressed in relevant
              cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and
              infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER
              prioritizes functionally important players within trait-associated
              modules, even when they lack individual associations. Our approach
              bridges the gap between genetic associations and disease
              mechanisms, providing a powerful tool for identifying novel
              therapeutic targets and advancing our understanding of complex
              trait architecture.

            Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform
            their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex
            traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
            across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is
            critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide
            association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes
            in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the
            architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions
            play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we
            introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait
            associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common
            latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is
            based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across
            the same conditions. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes,
            PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal
            potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that
            diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
            relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting
            known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action.
            Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we

              Genes work together in specific contexts to perform their
              functions, and understanding how they influence complex traits
              requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different conditions. This insight is critical for
              developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies
              have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant
              mechanisms. However, modern models of complex trait architecture
              predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease
              origin and progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational
              approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological
              perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint
              analysis. This representation is based on modules of co-expressed
              genes across the same conditions. By incorporating groups of
              co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic
              associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene
              strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated
              with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our
              approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers
              mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important
              players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated
              modules by PhenoPLIER. Our findings highlight the importance of
              considering gene co-expression patterns in understanding disease
              etiology and identifying therapeutic targets.

              Understanding the complex interplay between genes and their
              influence on traits requires a mechanistic view of gene expression
              regulation across diverse contexts, which is crucial for
              developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association
              studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in
              disease-relevant mechanisms, current models of complex trait
              architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal
              role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce
              PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait
              associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared
              latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes
              across the same conditions. By incorporating these gene modules,
              PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers
              potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate
              that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
              expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately
              predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action.
              Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we
              find that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players
              within trait-associated modules, even when they lack individual
              associations. Our results highlight the importance of considering
              gene co-expression patterns in understanding disease etiology and
              identifying therapeutic targets, paving the way for more effective
              drug discovery and repurposing strategies.
