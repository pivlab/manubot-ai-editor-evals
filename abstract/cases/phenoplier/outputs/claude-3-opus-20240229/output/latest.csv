Deciphering the complex interplay between genes and their influence on traits is crucial for understanding disease mechanisms and developing targeted therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes, the architecture of complex traits suggests that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. However, current approaches lack the ability to integrate gene-trait associations with pharmacological data to uncover novel therapeutic targets. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data into a shared latent space, enabling a joint analysis based on modules of co-expressed genes across relevant conditions. Our approach accurately identifies known drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of action, and prioritizes functionally important genes missed by single-gene strategies, as demonstrated through a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. By leveraging the context of co-expressed gene modules, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential therapeutic targets, advancing our understanding of complex trait biology and facilitating drug repurposing efforts.

Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous genetic variants linked to complex traits, but translating these associations into mechanistic insights remains challenging. Gene expression data across diverse conditions can provide a functional context for understanding how genes work together to influence complex traits. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified framework based on gene co-expression modules. PhenoPLIER reveals that diseases are significantly associated with modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and their mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes within trait-associated modules, even when they lack individual associations. By considering the context of gene co-expression, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful approach for elucidating the etiology of complex traits and identifying potential therapeutic targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. However, determining the impact of these interactions on complex traits remains a challenge. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, thereby advancing our understanding of the complex gene-gene interactions underlying disease and facilitating the development of targeted therapies.

PhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes across diverse conditions. This approach reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, and infers mechanisms of action. Applying PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation prioritizes functionally important genes that lack associations but are highlighted in trait-associated modules. By considering groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and identifies potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Genes function in concert within specific contexts, and understanding their expression regulation across conditions is crucial for elucidating their influence on complex traits and developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER addresses this challenge by providing a framework for integrating genetic associations and functional genomics data to gain insights into disease etiology and identify novel therapeutic targets.

Here is the revised abstract:

Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to perform their biological roles. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions, which is critical for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. This joint analysis allows for the contextualization of genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful tool for understanding disease etiology and identifying novel therapeutic targets.

Gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in the origin and progression of complex traits and diseases, but current transcriptome-wide association studies primarily focus on the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. To fully understand how genes influence complex traits and develop new therapies, it is critical to determine how groups of genes are regulated and expressed in concert across different conditions. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players within trait-associated modules that lack associations when considered individually. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, thereby advancing our understanding of complex trait architecture and facilitating the development of new therapies.

Deciphering the complex interplay between genes and their influence on traits is crucial for understanding disease mechanisms and developing targeted therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes, the architecture of complex traits suggests that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. However, current approaches lack the ability to contextualize genetic associations and identify potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. By leveraging this approach, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we show that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players within trait-associated modules, even when they lack direct associations. Our findings highlight the power of integrating genetic associations with gene co-expression patterns to uncover disease etiology and identify novel therapeutic targets, ultimately advancing our understanding of complex traits and facilitating drug repurposing efforts.
