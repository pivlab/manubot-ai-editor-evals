Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous genetic variants linked to complex traits and diseases, but translating these associations into mechanistic insights remains challenging.

Unraveling the complex interplay between genes and traits requires a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across diverse conditions. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER leverages modules of co-expressed genes to contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players within trait-associated modules, even when they lack individual associations. By incorporating gene-gene interactions, which are predicted to play a crucial role in disease origin and progression, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of gene modules. Our findings underscore the importance of considering gene co-expression patterns in developing new therapies and highlight the potential of PhenoPLIER in uncovering disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

Unraveling the complex interplay between genes and traits requires a mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across diverse conditions. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. PhenoPLIER leverages modules of co-expressed genes to capture the context-specific nature of gene function and interactions, which are critical for disease origin, progression, and the development of new therapies. By mapping diseases to gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes within trait-associated modules, even when they lack individual associations. Our findings highlight the importance of considering gene-gene interactions in the architecture of complex traits. In summary, PhenoPLIER provides a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the lens of co-expressed gene modules, contextualizing these associations, and revealing potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies.

Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous genetic variants associated with complex traits and diseases, but translating these associations into mechanistic insights and therapeutic targets remains challenging. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel computational method that integrates genetic associations with gene co-expression networks to identify trait-relevant gene modules and prioritize potential drug targets. By analyzing genetic associations through the lens of gene expression patterns across diverse cell types and tissues, PhenoPLIER reveals disease etiology and drug mechanisms in a way that single-gene strategies cannot. We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of action, and identifies functionally important genes missed by standard approaches, as validated by a CRISPR screen of lipid regulation. PhenoPLIER thus provides a powerful framework for interpreting genetic associations, prioritizing therapeutic targets, and ultimately accelerating the translation of genetic discoveries into clinical advances.

Genes function collaboratively within specific contexts to carry out their biological roles. To understand how these genes contribute to complex traits, it is essential to elucidate the mechanisms of expression regulation across diverse conditions.

Gene expression patterns across different contexts provide critical insights into the mechanistic basis of complex traits and the development of new therapies. However, integrating these patterns with genetic associations to elucidate disease etiology and drug mechanisms remains challenging. Here, we present PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that leverages gene co-expression modules to contextualize genetic associations and predict drug-disease relationships. By applying PhenoPLIER to a wide range of traits, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and that our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we show that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes within trait-associated modules that lack direct genetic associations. Our results highlight the power of incorporating gene co-expression patterns to reveal potential therapeutic targets missed by single-gene strategies, providing a new framework for interpreting genetic associations and advancing our understanding of complex trait biology.

Here is the revised abstract:

Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to carry out their biological roles. To understand how these genes influence complex traits, it is crucial to gain mechanistic insights into gene expression regulation across diverse conditions. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of this understanding for the development of novel therapies. In this study, we demonstrate that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers their mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we identify functionally important genes that lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. In summary, by considering groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. PhenoPLIER presents a novel framework for interpreting genetic associations through the perspective of gene modules.

The revised abstract incorporates the following changes:
1. Improved sentence structure and clarity
2. Consistent use of the term ""gene modules"" instead of ""groups of co-expressed genes""
3. Emphasis on the novelty and significance of the PhenoPLIER approach
4. Clearer connection between the CRISPR screen findings and the advantages of PhenoPLIER

Here is a revised version of the abstract with improvements in clarity, conciseness, and flow:

Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to perform their biological roles. Understanding how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic insight into expression regulation across diverse conditions, which is crucial for developing novel therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have revealed the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. Our approach highlights the importance of considering gene co-expression patterns in elucidating disease etiology and identifying potential therapeutic targets.

Understanding the complex interplay between genes and their influence on traits requires a mechanistic view of expression regulation across diverse contexts, which is crucial for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, the architecture of complex traits suggests that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. Our results demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players, despite lacking associations, are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. These findings highlight the importance of considering gene co-expression patterns in understanding disease etiology and identifying potential therapeutic targets, ultimately advancing the field of precision medicine and drug repurposing.

Gene regulation plays a crucial role in the development of complex traits and diseases. While transcriptome-wide association studies have identified individual genes involved in disease-relevant mechanisms, the role of gene-gene interactions in disease origin and progression remains poorly understood.

We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players within trait-associated modules, even when they lack individual associations.

"Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions.

Here is a revised version of the abstract with some suggested improvements:

Genes function in a coordinated manner within specific contexts to carry out their biological roles. Elucidating the influence of these genes on complex traits necessitates a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across diverse conditions, which is crucial for the development of novel therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have contributed to uncovering the involvement of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, contemporary models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease onset and progression. In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is constructed based on modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases exhibit significant associations with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach demonstrates accuracy in predicting established drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, we discover that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.

The main changes made:

1. Replaced some words with more formal or precise alternatives (e.g., ""act in concert"" to ""function in a coordinated manner,"" ""uncover the role"" to ""uncovering the involvement"").
2. Simplified some sentences for better readability and clarity.
3. Added transitional phrases to improve the flow of the abstract (e.g., ""In this study,"" ""Moreover"").
4. Corrected minor grammatical issues and made the tenses consistent throughout the abstract.

These revisions aim to enhance the clarity, coherence, and formality of the abstract while maintaining its original content and structure.

Gene expression regulation across different conditions is crucial for understanding how genes influence complex traits and developing new therapies.

We demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players within trait-associated modules, even when they lack individual associations.
