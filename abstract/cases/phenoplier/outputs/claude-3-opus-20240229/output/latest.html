Here is a revised version of the abstract with improved grammar, clarity, and flow:

Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. This insight has been shown to be critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.

The main changes include:

1. Correcting spelling and grammar errors (e.g., &quot;concierto&quot; to &quot;concert&quot;, &quot;specifico&quot; to &quot;specific&quot;).
2. Improving sentence structure and flow (e.g., &quot;It has been shown that this insight is critical&quot; to &quot;This insight has been shown to be critical&quot;).
3. Removing redundant words and phrases (e.g., &quot;significantl&quot; to &quot;significantly&quot;).
4. Ensuring consistent verb tense usage throughout the abstract.

These revisions help to improve the overall readability and clarity of the abstract while maintaining its scientific content and message.

Deciphering the complex interplay between genes and their influence on traits is crucial for understanding disease mechanisms and developing targeted therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes, the architecture of complex traits suggests that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. However, current approaches lack the ability to integrate gene-trait associations with pharmacological data to uncover novel therapeutic targets. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data into a shared latent space, enabling a joint analysis based on modules of co-expressed genes across relevant conditions. Our approach accurately identifies known drug-disease pairs, infers mechanisms of action, and prioritizes functionally important genes missed by single-gene strategies, as demonstrated through a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation. By leveraging the context of co-expressed gene modules, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential therapeutic targets, advancing our understanding of complex trait biology and facilitating drug repurposing efforts.

Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous genetic variants linked to complex traits, but translating these associations into mechanistic insights remains challenging. Gene expression data across diverse conditions can provide a functional context for understanding how genes work together to influence complex traits. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified framework based on gene co-expression modules. PhenoPLIER reveals that diseases are significantly associated with modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and their mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes within trait-associated modules, even when they lack individual associations. By considering the context of gene co-expression, PhenoPLIER provides a powerful approach for elucidating the etiology of complex traits and identifying potential therapeutic targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies.

Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players lacking associations in trait-associated modules. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, thereby advancing our understanding of complex trait architecture and facilitating the development of new therapies.

Genome-wide association studies have identified numerous genetic variants linked to complex traits, but translating these associations into mechanistic insights remains challenging. Gene expression data across diverse conditions can provide a functional context for understanding how genes work together to influence complex traits. Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified framework based on gene co-expression modules. By mapping diseases and drug effects onto these modules, PhenoPLIER reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and their mechanisms of action. Moreover, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes within trait-associated modules, even when they lack individual genetic associations. Our results highlight the power of leveraging gene co-expression patterns to contextualize genetic associations, identify potential therapeutic targets, and guide drug repurposing efforts, thereby advancing our understanding of complex trait biology and facilitating the development of new treatments.

Deciphering the complex interplay between genes and their influence on traits is crucial for understanding disease mechanisms and developing targeted therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes, the architecture of complex traits suggests that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. However, current approaches lack the ability to integrate gene-trait associations with pharmacological perturbation data, hindering the identification of potential therapeutic targets. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that maps gene-trait associations and drug perturbation data into a shared latent space, enabling a joint analysis based on modules of co-expressed genes across relevant conditions. Our approach accurately identifies disease-associated gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, predicts known drug-disease pairs, and infers mechanisms of action. Notably, using a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes within trait-associated modules, even when they lack individual associations. By considering groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and uncovers potential therapeutic targets that single-gene strategies may overlook, thereby advancing our understanding of complex trait architecture and facilitating drug discovery efforts.

Here is the revised abstract:

PhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes across diverse conditions. This approach reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs, and infers mechanisms of action. Applying PhenoPLIER to a CRISPR screen for lipid regulation prioritizes functionally important genes that lack associations but are highlighted in trait-associated modules. By considering groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and identifies potential targets overlooked by single-gene strategies. Genes function in concert within specific contexts, and understanding their expression regulation across conditions is crucial for elucidating their influence on complex traits and developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, but modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER addresses this challenge by providing a framework for integrating genetic associations and functional genomics data to gain insights into disease etiology and identify novel therapeutic targets.

Here is a revised version of the abstract with improved clarity and flow:

PhenoPLIER is a novel computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes across various conditions. This approach reveals that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important genes within trait-associated modules, even when they lack direct associations. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and identifies potential targets that may be overlooked by single-gene strategies. 

Genes function in concert within specific contexts, and understanding the regulation of their expression across different conditions is crucial for elucidating their influence on complex traits and developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in disease origin and progression. PhenoPLIER addresses this by leveraging the power of co-expression modules to provide a more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and potential therapeutic targets.

Determining how genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions, which is critical for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. However, current approaches lack the ability to incorporate these interactions and contextualize genetic associations. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies, thereby advancing our understanding of complex trait architecture and facilitating the development of new therapies.

Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. By incorporating these gene modules, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. PhenoPLIER&#39;s joint analysis of gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data provides a more comprehensive understanding of gene expression regulation in complex traits, facilitating the development of new therapies.

Deciphering the complex interplay between genes and their influence on traits is crucial for understanding disease mechanisms and developing targeted therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on the role of individual genes, the architecture of complex traits suggests that gene-gene interactions play a pivotal role in disease etiology and progression. However, current approaches lack the ability to contextualize genetic associations and identify potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational method that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a shared latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. By leveraging this approach, we demonstrate that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Moreover, through a CRISPR screen focused on lipid regulation, we show that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players within trait-associated modules, even when they lack direct associations. Our findings highlight the power of integrating genetic associations with gene co-expression patterns to uncover disease etiology and identify novel therapeutic targets, ultimately advancing our understanding of complex traits and facilitating drug repurposing efforts.

While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models of complex trait architecture predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. We introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. By incorporating these gene modules, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players within trait-associated modules, even when they lack individual associations. Our results demonstrate the power of integrating co-expression information with genetic associations to elucidate disease etiology and identify novel therapeutic targets.

Gene regulation plays a crucial role in determining how genes influence complex traits, and understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease, the architecture of complex traits suggests that gene-gene interactions are also critical in disease origin and progression. However, current approaches lack the ability to contextualize genetic associations and identify potential targets that may be missed by single-gene strategies. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes. By incorporating these gene modules, PhenoPLIER reveals that diseases are significantly associated with modules expressed in relevant cell types and accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players within trait-associated modules, even when they lack individual associations. Our approach bridges the gap between genetic associations and disease mechanisms, providing a powerful tool for identifying novel therapeutic targets and advancing our understanding of complex trait architecture.

Understanding how genes interact to influence complex traits is critical for developing new therapies. While transcriptome-wide association studies have uncovered the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms, modern models predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation based on modules of co-expressed genes across the same conditions. By incorporating these modules, PhenoPLIER contextualizes genetic associations and reveals potential targets missed by single-gene strategies. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach accurately predicts known drug-disease pairs and infers mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that PhenoPLIER prioritizes functionally important players lacking associations within trait-associated modules. PhenoPLIER&#39;s ability to uncover gene-gene interactions and their role in disease provides a more comprehensive understanding of complex traits, ultimately facilitating the development of targeted therapies.
