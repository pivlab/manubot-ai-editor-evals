New tools and services make it increasingly feasible to publicly share the unabridged methods of a study, especially for computational research, which consists solely of software and data. For example, open access publishing provides an economic model that encourages maximal dissemination and reuse of scholarly articles [@isbn:9780262517638; @doi:10.12688/f1000research.8460.3; @doi:10.7554/eLife.16800]. More broadly, open licensing solves legal barriers to content reuse, enabling any type of scholarly output to become part of the commons [@doi:10.1109/MCSE.2009.19; @doi:10.1038/536016a]. The opportunity to reuse data and code for new investigations, as well as a push for increased reproducibility, has begot a movement to make all research outputs public, unless there are bona fide privacy or security concerns [@doi:10.1126/science.aah6168; @doi:10.1038/nature10836; @doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001195]. Science is undergoing a transition towards openness. The internet provides a global information commons, where scholarship can be publicly shared at a minimal cost.
