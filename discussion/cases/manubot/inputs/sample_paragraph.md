The open scholarly writing Manubot enables has particular benefits for review articles, which present the state of the art in a scientific field [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003149]. Literature reviews are typically written in private by an invited team of colleagues. In contrast, broadly opening the process to anyone engaged in the topic --- such that planning, organizing, writing, and editing occur collaboratively in a public forum where anyone is welcome to participate --- can maximize a review's value. Open drafting of reviews is especially helpful for capturing state-of-the-art knowledge about rapidly advancing research topics at the intersection of existing disciplines where contributors bring diverse opinions and expertise.
