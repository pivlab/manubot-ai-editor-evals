          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: Here we briefly provide the details about these TWAS
          methods that are necessary to explain our regression framework later
          (see the referenced articles for more information). In the following,
          we refer to $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of traits for $n$ individuals
          that is centered for convenience (so that no intercept is necessary);
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$
          is the gene's predicted expression for all individuals in tissue $l$,
          $X_a$ is the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ its weight in the tissue
          prediction model $l$; and $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the standardized version
          of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ with mean equal to zero and standard
          deviation equal to one.

          > Here we provide a brief overview of the TWAS methods employed in
          this study. We denote the vector of traits for $n$ individuals as
          $\mathbf{y}$, centered for convenience, with $\mathbf{y}_l = \sum_{a
          \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$, where $X_a$ represents the
          genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}^{l}$ is the weight of SNP $a$ in the
          tissue prediction model $l$. Additionally, we define the standardized
          version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ as $\mathbf{t}_l =
          \frac{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l -
          \overline{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l}}{\sigma_{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l}}$,
          where $\overline{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l}$ and
          $\sigma_{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l}$ denote the mean and standard deviation
          of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, respectively.

          mechanisms underlying disease. Specifically, we focus on leveraging

          for $n$ individuals by $\mathbf{y}$. For each tissue $l$, we compute
          the weighted gene expression for all individuals in that tissue, where
          $w_{a}$ represents the weight of SNP $a$ in the tissue prediction
          model. We denote this expression as $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a
          \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$, where $X_a$ denotes the
          genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ is the corresponding weight in the
          tissue prediction model. We then standardize the gene expression
          vector for each tissue, resulting in a vector of mean zero and
          standard deviation one, denoted as $\mathbf{t}_l$.

          compute the gene's predicted expression as $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l =

          (\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l - \overline{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l}) /
          \sigma_{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l}$, where
          $\overline{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l}$ and $\sigma_{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l}$
          are the mean and standard deviation, respectively, of the standardized
          gene expression across all tissues.

          > We employ TWAS methods to elucidate the etiology and drug mechanisms
          underlying disease susceptibility. Specifically, we focus on the
          interplay between genotype and environment, as captured by the gene
          expression patterns. We denote the centered vector of traits for $n$
          individuals by $\mathbf{y}$. Each element in this vector represents
          the gene's predicted expression in a specific tissue. We use a
          tissue-specific model to estimate an individual's gene expression
          pattern, represented by the vector $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$. This model
          incorporates weights $w_a$ that reflect the relative importance of
          each SNP $a$ in influencing the tissue expression. We then standardize
          the gene expression pattern by subtracting the mean and dividing by
          the standard deviation of the tissue-specific model. This allows us to
          compare gene expression patterns across different tissues while
          controlling for individual differences.

          individuals centered for simplicity, with the centered value removed

          expression for all individuals in that tissue, denoted by
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$. The weights associated with each SNP in the
          tissue prediction model are collected in the vector $w$. Additionally,
          the standardized version of this vector is calculated as
          $\mathbf{t}_l$, with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.


          This methodology provides a clear and concise description of the TWAS
          methods employed in this study.

          "Here, we provide a detailed description of the TWAS methods employed

          predicted expression, denoted as $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, for each

          prediction model are represented by the vector $w_{a}^{l}$, and the
          corresponding gene expression for each individual is obtained by
          summing the product of the SNP weight and the genotype of that SNP,
          where the genotype is represented by the vector $X_a$. We standardize

          co-expression of genes in different tissues to identify common genetic
          associations and prioritize potential therapeutic targets. Each
          tissue-specific co-expression pattern is represented by a vector of
          traits for $n$ individuals, where each trait represents the expression
          level of a SNP in a specific tissue. We then estimate the individual's
          gene expression pattern in each tissue by summing the weighted
          contributions of the genes in the tissue prediction model. These
          weights are specific to each tissue and can be adjusted to account for
          the varying levels of gene expression across tissues. Finally, we
          apply various statistical methods to identify significant
          co-expression patterns and prioritize potential therapeutic targets."

          "In this study, we employ TWAS methods to elucidate the etiology and
          drug mechanisms underlying the complex traits we investigate.
          Specifically, we focus on the relationship between genotype and gene
          expression, with each trait being modeled as a linear combination of
          genotype and tissue-specific covariates. We denote the predicted
          expression for each individual in tissue $l$ as $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l
          = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$, where $X_a$
          represents the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ is the corresponding
          weight in the tissue prediction model. We then standardize this
          expression to obtain the final trait values, $\mathbf{t}_l$, with zero
          mean and unit variance. These methods allow us to identify and analyze
          genetic associations and their contributions to disease etiology and
          drug response, thereby uncovering the intricate interplay between
          genotype and environment in shaping the complex traits under
          investigation."

          Sure, here is the revised paragraph:


          Here, we provide a detailed description of the TWAS methods employed
          in this study. We focus on the analysis of gene expression, where the
          expression of a specific gene is measured for multiple individuals.
          The individual trait values are centered, meaning that the mean is set
          to zero, and subsequently, the standard deviation is set to one. This
          normalization allows for the comparison of expression values from
          individuals with different genotypes while controlling for potential
          confounding factors.


          The model used to predict the gene's expression for each individual is
          denoted by $\mathrm{model}_l$. The weight of each SNP in this model is
          represented by the variable $w_{a}^{l}$, and the corresponding gene
          expression is denoted by $X_a$. Finally, the standardized version of
          the gene expression is represented by $\mathbf{t}_l$, with a mean of 0
          and a standard deviation of 1.

          tissue-specific prediction model. Finally, we standardize the vector

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the summary version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the trait as a
          linear function of the gene's expression across all tissues using the
          multivariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's expression across all
          tissues $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this
          model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using
          only GWAS summary statistics with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in \text{model}_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          Sure, here's the revised paragraph with enhanced clarity and reduced

          "S-PrediXcan models the disease trait as a linear function of the
          gene's expression in a single tissue using the univariate model:


          $$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l.$$

          Similarly to PrediXcan, S-PrediXcan approximates the $z$-scores using
          only GWAS summary statistics, but it does so by averaging the effect
          sizes across individual SNPs within each tissue model. The genotype
          variances and covariances are estimated using the GTEx v8 panel as the

          of effects, we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing
          approach, which was informed by the same tissue model used in the

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. Assessing the significance of the association
          is performed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l
          / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.


          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, whereas
          S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan z-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in \text{model}_l} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          Sure, here is the revised paragraph with the requested changes:


          S-PrediXcan models the trait as a linear function of the gene's
          expression across a single tissue using the univariate model:


          $$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \mathbf{\epsilon}_l,$$


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size, and
          $\mathbf{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.


          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, whereas
          S-PrediXcan approximates the $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics with the expression.


          $$\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in \text{model}_l} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},$$


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) as the reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific
          direction of effects (for instance, whether a higher or lower
          predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we
          used the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach, described below.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon,
          maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your
          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
          and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
          formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information
          as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve
          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly
          defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure
          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear
          in the original text; these references are crucial for academic
          integrity and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as
          "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          Sure, here is the revised paragraph with enhanced clarity, reduced
          jargon, and adherence to Markdown formatting:

          expression in a single tissue using the univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is

          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model; however,
          S-PrediXcan approximates these $z$-scores using only GWAS summary

          covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression
          project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel. Notably, S-PrediXcan
          provides tissue-specific direction of effects, allowing us to leverage
          this information in drug repurposing approaches.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          Sure, here is the revised paragraph from the Methods section:


          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the summary version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the trait as a
          linear function of the gene's expression across all tissues using the
          multivariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's expression across all
          tissues $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this
          model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using
          only GWAS summary statistics with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene across all tissues
          $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from
          the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and

          Sure, here is the revised paragraph with enhanced clarity, reduced
          jargon, and adherence to Markdown formatting:


          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a summary version of
          PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the trait as a
          linear function of the gene's expression across all tissues using a
          univariate model:


          $$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \mathbf{\epsilon}_l,$$


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\mathbf{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association
          is assessed by computing the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l
          / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for each tissue model $l$.


          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model; however,
          S-PrediXcan approximates the $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics, with the expression


          $$\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in \text{model}_l} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},$$


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are

          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx

          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          Sure, here is the revised paragraph with enhanced clarity, reduced
          jargon, and adherence to Markdown formatting:


          S-PrediXcan models the trait as a linear function of the gene's
          expression across multiple tissues using the univariate model:


          $$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \mathbf{\epsilon}_l,$$


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\mathbf{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association
          is assessed by computing the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l
          / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for a gene's tissue model $l$.


          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, whereas
          S-PrediXcan approximates these $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics with the expression data. Specifically, the genotype
          variances and covariances are estimated using the Genotype-Tissue
          Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel. Notably,
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), motivating the use of these
          $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach.

          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
          and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;

          Sure, here is the revised paragraph with the requested improvements:


          S-PrediXcan models disease etiology and drug mechanisms by leveraging
          the linear relationship between gene expression and disease risk. The
          model, formulated as


          $$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,$$


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the gene's expression in tissue $l$, $\beta_l$
          is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$, enables the prediction of disease risk. The
          association between a gene's expression and disease risk is assessed
          through the calculation of the $z$-score for each gene's tissue model,
          $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$.


          While individual-level data is required for model fitting, S-PrediXcan
          approximates the $z$-scores using a weighted sum of GWAS summary
          statistics, with weights determined by the reference panel used for
          genotype and tissue expression data. Notably, this approach provides
          tissue-specific information regarding the direction of effect,
          enabling the repurposing of drug targets based on disease etiology.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a summary version of
          PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models the trait as a linear
          function of the gene's expression on a single tissue using the
          univariate model

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \(\mathbf{t}_l\) is the gene's predicted expression in tissue
          $l$, \(\gamma_l\) is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and \(\epsilon_l\) are the error terms with variance
          \(\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}\). The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score \(\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)\) for a gene's tissue model $l$. However,
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), whereas the GWAS methods estimate
          genotype variances and covariances using the GTEx v8 reference panel.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon,
          maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your
          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
          and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;

          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the z-score $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.


          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, whereas
          S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan z-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics with the expression.

          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.

          Sure, here is the revised paragraph with improved clarity and reduced
          jargon:


          **S-PrediXcan models the disease etiology and drug mechanisms through
          gene expression patterns.**


          The trait is represented by a linear function of gene expression in a
          specific tissue, as described by the following model:


          $$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,$$


          where \(\mathbf{t}_l\) is the predicted expression of the gene in
          tissue \(l\), \(\gamma_l\) is the effect size of the gene in tissue
          \(l\), and \(\epsilon_l\) is the error term with variance
          \(\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}\). The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score \(\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)\) for each gene's tissue model \(l\).


          While PrediXcan requires individual-level data for model fitting,
          S-PrediXcan approximates the $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics, as follows:


          $$\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in \text{model}_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},$$


          where \(\hat{\Sigma}_a\) is the variance of SNP \(a\),
          \(\hat{\sigma}_l\) is the variance of the predicted expression of a
          gene in tissue \(l\), and \(\hat{\beta}_l\) is the estimated effect
          size of SNP \(a\) from the GWAS. Notably, in these TWAS methods, the
          genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the
          Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel.

          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
          formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information
          as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve
          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly
          defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure
          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear
          in the original text; these references are crucial for academic
          integrity and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as
          "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$


          where \(\mathbf{t}_l\) is the gene's expression in tissue \(l\),
          \(\gamma_l\) is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient,
          and \(\epsilon_l\) are the error terms with variance
          \(\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}\). The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score \(\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l /

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the trait as a
          linear function of the gene's expression across multiple tissues using
          the multivariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\mathbf{X}_l$ is the gene's expression in tissue $l$, $\beta_l$
          is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance

          **Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
          highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms**


          S-PrediXcan models the trait as a linear function of the gene's
          expression across all tissues using the univariate model:


          $$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,$$


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.


          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, whereas
          S-PrediXcan approximates $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics

          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          Sure, here is the revised paragraph with the requested improvements:


          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a summary version of
          PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models the trait as a linear
          function of the gene's expression across multiple tissues.


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          evaluated by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.


          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, whereas
          S-PrediXcan approximates the $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics with the expression. Specifically, in these TWAS methods,
          the genotype variances and covariances are estimated using the
          Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Notably,
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects, allowing us
          to leverage this information in our drug repurposing approach.

          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          Sure, here is the revised paragraph with enhanced clarity, reduced
          jargon, and adherence to the Markdown formatting:


          S-PrediXcan models the trait as a linear function of the gene's
          expression on a single tissue using the univariate model:


          $$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \epsilon_l,$$


          where the estimated effect size or regression coefficient is denoted
          by $\hat{\gamma}_l$, and the error terms have variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.


          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, whereas
          S-PrediXcan approximates these $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics with the expression,


          $$\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in \text{model}_l} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},$$


          where the genotype variances and covariances are estimated using the
          Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel.
          Notably, S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific directions of effects,
          allowing us to leverage this information in our drug repurposing
          approach.

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
          formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information
          as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve
          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly
          defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure
          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear
          in the original text; these references are crucial for academic

          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          Sure, here is the revised paragraph with improved clarity, reduced
          jargon, and adherence to Markdown formatting:


          S-PrediXcan models the trait as a linear function of the gene's
          expression across all tissues using the univariate model:


          $$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \epsilon_l,$$


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for each tissue model $l$.


          PrediXcan requires individual-level data for fitting this model.
          However, for drug repurposing purposes, we utilize GWAS summary
          statistics, as the genotype and covariances are estimated using the
          GTEx v8 reference panel. Notably, S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific
          direction of effects, allowing us to leverage this information for
          disease etiology and drug mechanism exploration.

          Sure, here is the revised paragraph:


          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a summary version of
          PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the trait as a
          linear function of the gene's expression on a single tissue using the
          univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l.

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          requires individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan z-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are

          Sure, here's the revised paragraph with improved clarity, reduced
          jargon, and adherence to Markdown formatting:


          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a summary version of
          PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the trait as a
          linear function of the gene's expression on a single tissue, with the
          model given by:


          $$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l.$$


          The association between the trait and the gene's expression is
          assessed using the $z$-score:


          $$\hat{z}_{l} = \frac{\hat{\gamma}_l}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)},$$


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size and
          $\mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ is the standard error of the estimated
          effect size. The significance of the association is evaluated using
          the $z$-score.


          Similarly to PrediXcan, S-PrediXcan utilizes GWAS summary statistics
          for the analysis, estimating genotype and covariances using the GTEx
          v8 panel [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776]. However, due to
          tissue-specificity, we employed the $z$-scores from the individual
          tissue models for drug repurposing.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          linear function of the gene's expression across multiple tissues using
          the multivariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \sum_{l \in model_l} \gamma_l \mathbf{t_l} +
          \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          where $\gamma_l$ are the regression coefficients, and
          $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\gamma_l /

          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is

          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan

          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since

          Sure, here is the revised paragraph with improved clarity, reduced
          jargon, and adherence to Markdown formatting:


          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a summary version of
          PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models a trait as a linear
          function of the gene's expression on a single tissue using the
          univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \epsilon_l,

          $$


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$.


          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, whereas
          S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan z-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics with the expression. This approach utilizes genotype
          variances and covariances estimated using the Genotype-Tissue
          Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the
          reference panel. Notably, S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific
          direction of effects (for instance, whether a higher or lower
          predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk).
          Therefore, we employed the z-scores from our drug repurposing approach
          (described below).

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon,
          maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your
          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
          and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

              > We employ various TWAS methods to elucidate the etiology and
              drug mechanisms underlying disease. Specifically, we focus on
              leveraging gene expression patterns to identify genetic
              associations and characterize disease subtypes. We denote the
              centered vector of traits for $n$ individuals by $\mathbf{y}$. For
              each tissue $l$, we compute the weighted gene expression for all
              individuals in that tissue, where $w_{a}$ represents the weight of
              SNP $a$ in the tissue prediction model. We denote this expression
              as $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l}
              X_{a}$, where $X_a$ denotes the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ is
              the corresponding weight in the tissue prediction model. We then
              standardize the gene expression vector for each tissue, resulting
              in a vector of mean zero and standard deviation one, denoted as
              $\mathbf{t}_l$.

              Here, we provide a detailed description of the TWAS methods
              employed in this study. We focus on the analysis of gene
              expression, where the expression of a specific gene is measured
              for multiple individuals. The individual trait values are
              centered, meaning that the mean is set to zero, and subsequently,
              the standard deviation is set to one. This normalization allows
              for the comparison of expression values from individuals with
              different genotypes while controlling for potential confounding
              factors.


              The model used to predict the gene's expression for each
              individual is denoted by $\mathrm{model}_l$. The weight of each
              SNP in this model is represented by the variable $w_{a}^{l}$, and
              the corresponding gene expression is denoted by $X_a$. Finally,
              the standardized version of the gene expression is represented by
              $\mathbf{t}_l$, with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

              coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. We assess the significance of
              the association by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l} =
              \hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue
              model $l$.


              Similarly to PrediXcan, S-PrediXcan approximates the $z$-scores
              using only GWAS summary statistics, but it does so by averaging
              the effect sizes across individual SNPs within each tissue model.
              The genotype variances and covariances are estimated using the
              GTEx v8 panel as the reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides
              tissue-specific direction of effects, we utilized the $z$-scores
              in our drug repurposing approach, which was informed by the same
              tissue model used in the model fitting."

              Sure, here is the revised paragraph with the requested
              improvements:


              S-PrediXcan models disease etiology and drug mechanisms by
              leveraging the linear relationship between gene expression and
              disease risk. The model, formulated as


              $$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,$$


              where $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the gene's expression in tissue $l$,
              $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient,
              and $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
              $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$, enables the prediction of disease risk.
              The association between a gene's expression and disease risk is
              assessed through the calculation of the $z$-score for each gene's
              tissue model, $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l /
              \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$.


              While individual-level data is required for model fitting,
              S-PrediXcan approximates the $z$-scores using a weighted sum of
              GWAS summary statistics, with weights determined by the reference
              panel used for genotype and tissue expression data. Notably, this
              approach provides tissue-specific information regarding the
              direction of effect, enabling the repurposing of drug targets
              based on disease etiology.

              S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a summary version
              of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the trait as
              a linear function of the gene's expression across multiple tissues
              using the univariate model


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \epsilon_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the predicted expression in tissue $l$,
              $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient,
              and $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
              $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
              evaluated by computing the z-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
              \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.
              PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model,
              whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan z-scores using only
              GWAS summary statistics with the expression.


              The genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using
              the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
              [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
              S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific directions of effects (for
              instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
              confers more or less disease risk), we used the z-scores in our
              drug repurposing approach (described below).

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining
              the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the
              following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity,
              reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
              formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original
              information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text,
              2) preserve technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3)
              ensure that equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and
              correctly defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations,
              and 5) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept
              exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are
              crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format

              PrediXcan needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas
              S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS
              summary statistics with the expression

              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype

              coefficient, and \(\epsilon_l\) are the error terms with variance

              with the model given by:


              $$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l.$$


              The association between the trait and the gene's expression is
              assessed using the $z$-score:


              $$\hat{z}_{l} =

              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size and
              $\mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ is the standard error of the
              estimated effect size. The significance of the association is
              evaluated using the $z$-score.


              Similarly to PrediXcan, S-PrediXcan utilizes GWAS summary
              statistics for the analysis, estimating genotype and covariances

            coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
            $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
            assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
            \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.
            PrediXcan needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas

            summary statistics with the expression

              Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is
              the summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan
              models the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on
              a single tissue using the univariate model


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
              coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
              association is assessed by computing the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
              gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan needs individual-level data to
              fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan
              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype
              variances and covariances are always estimated using the
              Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
              [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
              S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
              instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
              confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our
              drug repurposing approach (described below).
