The predicted gene expression for each individual in tissue $l$ is calculated as the sum of the weights of the genetic variants in that tissue, multiplied by the genotype of the SNP.

The significance of the association is assessed by computing the $z$-score $\\hat{z}_{l}=\\hat{\\gamma}_l / \\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression\n\n$$\n\\hat{z}_{l} \\appro \\sum_{a \\in model_{l}} w_a^l \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_a}{\\hat{\\sigma}_l} \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_a}{\\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\beta}_a)},\n$$ {#eq:spredixcan}\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).\n\nRevised paragraph:",

The weights associated with each SNP in the tissue prediction model are collected in the vector $w$. Additionally, the standardized version of this vector is calculated as $\\mathbf{t}_l$, with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n\nThis methodology provides a clear and concise description of the TWAS methods employed in this study.",

Specifically, we focus on leveraging the co-expression of genes in different tissues to identify common genetic associations and prioritize potential therapeutic targets. Each tissue-specific co-expression pattern is represented by a vector of traits for $n$ individuals, where each trait represents the expression level of a SNP in a specific tissue. We then estimate the individual's gene expression pattern in each tissue by summing the weighted contributions of the genes in the tissue prediction model. These weights are specific to each tissue and can be adjusted to account for the varying levels of gene expression across tissues. Finally, we apply various statistical methods to identify significant co-expression patterns and prioritize potential therapeutic targets.\"",

Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format \"[@TYPE:ID]\" such as \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\".\n\nInput paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single tissue using the univariate model\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{t}_l \\gamma_l + \\bm{\\epsilon}_l,\n$$ {#eq:predixcan}\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\\bm{\\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is assessed by computing the $z$-score $\\hat{z}_{l}=\\hat{\\gamma}_l / \\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression\n\n$$\n\\hat{z}_{l} \\approx \\sum_{a \\in model_{l}} w_a^l \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_a}{\\hat{\\sigma}_l} \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_a}{\\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\beta}_a)},\n$$ {#eq:spredixcan}\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).\n\nRevised paragraph:",

Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format \"[@TYPE:ID]\" such as \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\".\n\nInput paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single tissue using the univariate model\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{t}_l \\gamma_l + \\bm{\\epsilon}_l,\n$$ {#eq:predixcan}\n\nwhere \\mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$, $\\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is assessed by computing the $z$-score $\\hat{z}_{l}=\\hat{\\gamma}_l / \\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression\n\n$$\n\\hat{z}_{l} \\approx \\sum_{a \\in model_{l}} w_a^l \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_a}{\\hat{\\sigma}_l} \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_a}{\\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\beta}_a)},\n$$ {#eq:spredixcan}\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).\n\nRevised paragraph:",
