Sure, here's the revised paragraph with enhanced clarity and reduced jargon:

""S-PrediXcan models the disease trait as a linear function of the gene's expression in a single tissue using the univariate model:

$$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l.$$

where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. We assess the significance of the association by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.

Similarly to PrediXcan, S-PrediXcan approximates the $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics, but it does so by averaging the effect sizes across individual SNPs within each tissue model. The genotype variances and covariances are estimated using the GTEx v8 panel as the reference panel.

Sure, here is the revised paragraph with the requested improvements:

S-PrediXcan models disease etiology and drug mechanisms by leveraging the linear relationship between gene expression and disease risk. The model, formulated as

$$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,$$

where $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the gene's expression in tissue $l$, $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$, enables the prediction of disease risk. The association between a gene's expression and disease risk is assessed through the calculation of the $z$-score for each gene's tissue model, $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$.

While individual-level data is required for model fitting, S-PrediXcan approximates the $z$-scores using a weighted sum of GWAS summary statistics, with weights determined by the reference panel used for genotype and tissue expression data. Notably, this approach provides tissue-specific information regarding the direction of effect, enabling the repurposing of drug targets based on disease etiology.

Sure, here is the revised paragraph with improved clarity and reduced jargon:

**S-PrediXcan models the disease etiology and drug mechanisms through gene expression patterns.**

The trait is represented by a linear function of gene expression in a specific tissue, as described by the following model:

$$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,$$

where \(\mathbf{t}_l\) is the predicted expression of the gene in tissue \(l\), \(\gamma_l\) is the effect size of the gene in tissue \(l\), and \(\epsilon_l\) is the error term with variance \(\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}\). The significance of the association is assessed by computing the $z$-score \(\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)\) for each gene's tissue model \(l\).

While PrediXcan requires individual-level data for model fitting, S-PrediXcan approximates the $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics, as follows:

$$\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in \text{model}_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},$$

where \(\hat{\Sigma}_a\) is the variance of SNP \(a\), \(\hat{\sigma}_l\) is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue \(l\), and \(\hat{\beta}_l\) is the estimated effect size of SNP \(a\) from the GWAS. Notably, in these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel.

Sure, here is the revised paragraph:

S-PrediXcan [1] is a summary version of PrediXcan [2], which models the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single tissue. The model reads:

$$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,
$$

where \(\mathbf{t}_l\) is the predicted expression in tissue \(l\), \(\gamma_l\) is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and \(\epsilon_l\) are the error terms with variance \(\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}\). The significance of the association is assessed by computing the z-score \(\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)\) for a gene's tissue model \(l\).

In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [3] as the reference panel.

where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we used the z-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).

Fail Reason: Failed to fix the following expressions:
