In this section, we present an overview of the TWAS methods essential for understanding our subsequent regression framework (further details can be found in the referenced articles). For simplicity, let $\mathbf{y}$ denote a centered vector of traits for $n$ individuals.

S-PrediXcan[@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1], a summary version of PrediXcan[@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], models the trait as a linear function of gene expression in a single tissue using the univariate model:

$$
&#92;mathbf{y} = &#92;mathbf{t}_l &#92;gamma_l + &#92;bm{&#92;epsilon}_l, {#eq:predixcan}
$$

where $&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression coefficient and $&#92;bm{&#92;epsilon}_l$ are error terms with variance $&#92;sigma_{&#92;epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of association is evaluated by computing the $z$-score ($&#92;hat{z}_{l}=&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l / &#92;mathrm{se}(&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l)$) for a gene&#39;s tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression:

$$
&#92;hat{z}_{l} &#92;approx &#92;sum_{a &#92;in model_{l}} w_a^l &#92;frac{&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_a}{&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_l} &#92;frac{&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_a}{&#92;mathrm{se}(&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_a)}. {#eq:spredixcan}
$$

In this equation, $&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_l$ is the variance of predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and $&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_a$ represents the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from GWAS. The genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)[@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as a reference panel in these transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) methods. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific directions of effects, such as whether higher or lower predicted gene expression confers more or less disease risk, we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach, which will be described below.

[RESP] PrediXcan[@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], a method for predicting gene expression from genetic data, models the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single tissue using the univariate model

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$, $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

where $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ are error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is evaluated by computing the z-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan z-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression

where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from GWAS. In these TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)[@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects, i.e., whether a higher or lower predicted gene expression confers more or less disease risk, we used these z-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).

Here, $\mathbf{t}_l$ represents predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ are error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of this association is evaluated by calculating the z-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.

PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan z-scores using only GWAS summary statistics:

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

In this equation, $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ denotes the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_l$ represents the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from GWAS. In these TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are always calculated using Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)[@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects, including whether higher or lower predicted gene expression confers more or less disease risk, we utilized these z-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).
