S-PrediXcan[@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1], a summary version of PrediXcan[@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], models the trait as a linear function of gene expression in a single tissue using the univariate model:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,  {#eq:predixcan}
$$

where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size (or regression coefficient), and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of this association is assessed by computing the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for a gene's tissue model $l$.

PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model. In contrast, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics:

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)}.  {#eq:spredixcan}
$$

Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of a gene's predicted expression in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.

In both TWA methods, genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)[@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as a reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects—for example, whether higher or lower predicted gene expression confers more or less disease risk—we used these $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).
