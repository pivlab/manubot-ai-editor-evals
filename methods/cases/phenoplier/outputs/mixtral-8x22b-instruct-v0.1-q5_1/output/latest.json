Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format \"[@TYPE:ID]\" such as \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\".\n\nInput paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single tissue using the univariate model\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{t}_l \\gamma_l + \\bm{\\epsilon}_l,\n$$ {#eq:predixcan}\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\\bm{\\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is assessed by computing the $z$-score $\\hat{z}_{l}=\\hat{\\gamma}_l / \\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression\n\n$$\n\\hat{z}_{l} \\approx \\sum_{a \\in model_{l}} w_a^l \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_a}{\\hat{\\sigma}_l} \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_a}{\\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\beta}_a)},\n$$ {#eq:spredixcan}\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).\n\nRevised paragraph:",

PrediXcan models the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single tissue using the univariate model\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{t}_l \\gamma_l + \\bm{\\epsilon}_l,\n$$ {#eq:predixcan}\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\\bm{\\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is assessed by computing the $z$-score $\\hat{z}_{l}=\\hat{\\gamma}_l / \\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression\n\n$$\n\\hat{z}_{l} \\approx \\sum_{a \\in model_{l}} w_a^l \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_a}{\\hat{\\sigma}_l} \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_a}{\\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\beta}_a)},\n$$ {#eq:spredixcan}\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below)."

Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format \"[@TYPE:ID]\" such as \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\".\n\nInput paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367].

              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format \"[@TYPE:ID]\" such as \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\".\n\nInput paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single tissue using the univariate model\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{t_l \\gamma_l + \\bm{\\epsilon}_l,\n$$ {#eq:predixcan}\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\\bm{\\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is assessed by computing the $z$-score $\\hat{z}_{l}=\\hat{\\gamma}_l / \\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression\n\n$$\n\\hat{z}_{l} \\appro \\sum_{a \\in model_{l}} w_a^l \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_a}{\\hat{\\sigma}_l} \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_a}{\\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\beta}_a)},\n$$ {#eq:spredixcan}\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).\n\nRevised paragraph:",
