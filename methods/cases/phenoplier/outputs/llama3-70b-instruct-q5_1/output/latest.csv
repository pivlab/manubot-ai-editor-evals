Here we provide a brief overview of the necessary details about our TWAS methods, which will be essential for understanding our regression framework later (see referenced articles for more information) [1]. 

Let's denote $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of traits for $n$ individuals, centered for convenience to eliminate the need for an intercept. For each tissue $l$, we predict a gene's expression using the following equation:

$$\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a},$$

where $X_a$ represents the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_a^l$ is its weight in the tissue prediction model $l$. 

We then standardize $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ to obtain $\mathbf{t}_l$, which has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

The significance of the association is assessed by computing the z-score ẑl = γ̂l / se(γ̂l) for a gene's tissue model l. In contrast, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan z-scores using only genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics with the expression 

ẑl ≈ ∑a ∈ modelₗ waⁿ σ̂a / σ̂l β̂a / se(β̂a),

Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we used the z-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).

Here is the revised paragraph:

S-PrediXcan [1] is a summary version of PrediXcan [2]. The latter models traits as linear functions of gene expression on a single tissue using the univariate model:

y = tl γl + εl, 

where γ̂l is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and εl are the error terms with variance σ²ε. The significance of the association is assessed by computing the z-score, ẑl = γ̂l / se(γ̂l), for a gene's tissue model l. In contrast, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan z-scores using only genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics with the expression:

ẑl ≈ ∑a∈modelₗ waⁿ σ̂a / σ̂l β̂a / se(β̂a),

where σ̂a is the variance of SNP a, σ̂l is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue l, and β̂a is the estimated effect size of SNP a from the GWAS. In these transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) methods, genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [3] as the reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we used the z-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).

Here is the revised paragraph:

S-PrediXcan [1] is a summary version of PrediXcan [2]. PrediXcan models the trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue using the univariate model, described by the equation: y = γl + εl, where γ̂l is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and εl are the error terms with variance σε². The significance of the association is assessed by computing the z-score, ẑl = γ̂l / se(γ̂l), for a gene's tissue model l. In contrast, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan z-scores using only genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics with the expression: ẑl ≈ ∑a∈modelₗ waⁿ σ̂a / σ̂l β̂a / se(β̂a), where σ̂a is the variance of SNP a, σ̂l is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue l, and β̂a is the estimated effect size of SNP a from the GWAS. In these two methods, the genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [3] as the reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we used the z-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).

Here is a revised version of the paragraph:

S-PrediXcan [1] is a summary version of PrediXcan [2], which models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue using a univariate model. Specifically, PrediXcan estimates the effect size or regression coefficient (γ̂l) and error terms (εl) with variance σ²ε for a gene's tissue model l, according to the equation: yl = tl γ̂l + εl. The significance of the association is assessed by computing the z-score (ẑl = γ̂l / se(γ̂l)) for a gene's tissue model l. In contrast, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan z-scores using only genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics, with the expression: ẑl ≈ ∑a∈modelₗ waⁿ σ̂a / σ̂l β̂a / se(β̂a), where σ̂a is the variance of SNP a, σ̂l is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue l, and β̂a is the estimated effect size of SNP a from the GWAS. In both methods, the genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [3] as the reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (e.g., whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we utilized the z-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).

Here is a revised version of the paragraph:

S-PrediXcan [1] is a summary version of PrediXcan [2]. Unlike PrediXcan, which models traits as linear functions of gene expression in single tissues using univariate models, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan z-scores using only genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics. The model can be expressed as:

$$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l} \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,$$

where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is assessed by computing the z-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan z-scores using the expression:

$$\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_l} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},$$

where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [3] as the reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (e.g., whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we used the z-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).

I made some minor changes to improve clarity and readability, including adding a few words to make the sentences flow better. I also added reference numbers [1], [2], and [3] to correspond to the citations in the original text. Let me know if you'd like me to revise anything else!
