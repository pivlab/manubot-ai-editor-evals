Where $E[\tilde{\mathbf{t}}\_l]$ is the expected value and $SD[\tilde{\mathbf{t}}\_l]$ is the standard deviation of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}\_l$. These calculations enable us to analyze gene expression patterns in relation to genetic associations, contributing to a better understanding of disease etiology and potential drug mechanisms.

To clarify our regression framework, we briefly outline the key components of the TWAS methods as discussed in the referenced articles. For convenience, let $\mathbf{y}$ denote a vector of centered trait values for $n$ individuals, such that no intercept term is required. We define $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum\limits_{a \in \text{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$ as the predicted expression of gene $a$ across all individuals in tissue $l$. Here, $X_a$ represents the genotype data for SNP $a$, and $w_{a}^{l}$ denotes its corresponding weight in the tissue-specific prediction model $l$. The standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, denoted as $\mathbf{t}_l$, has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

[Equation 1]: \[\mathbf{y} = \beta_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{p} \beta_i Z_i + \epsilon\]

[Equation 2]: \[\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = X_a \cdot \mathbf{w}_l\]

[Equation 3]: \[\mathbf{t}_l = \frac{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l - E\left(\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l\right)}{Sd\left(\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l\right)}\]

In the following text, we will refer to $\mathbf{y}$, $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, and $\mathbf{t}_l$ as outlined above. Please note that these equations are numbered for ease of reference and are defined as follows: Equation 1 represents the linear regression model, Equation 2 illustrates the calculation of the predicted expression for gene $a$ in tissue $l$, and Equation 3 describes the standardization process for $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$.

In this section, we offer a brief overview of the TWAS methods used in our study, which will be further elaborated upon in the referenced articles. For clarity, we denote $\mathbf{y}$ as a centered vector of traits for $n$ individuals, with no intercept required. The predicted expression for each gene across all individuals in tissue $l$ is represented by $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, calculated as the sum of weighted genotype values $X_a$ and their corresponding weights $w_{a}^{l}$ from tissue prediction model $l$. Subsequently, we standardize this value to obtain $\mathbf{t}_l$, with a mean of zero and standard deviation of one.

Equation (1) below defines the weighted sum of genotypes for individual $i$ in tissue $l$:

$$ \tilde{t}_{il} = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{ia} $$

And equation (2) shows how we standardize the predicted expression:

$$ t_{il} = \frac{\tilde{t}_{il} - \mu_l}{\sigma_l} $$

Where $\mu_l$ and $\sigma_l$ denote the mean and standard deviation of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, respectively.

S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1], the summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue using the univariate model (Equation 1).

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

Here, $\mathbf{t}_l$ represents the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ are error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. To assess significance, we compute the $z$-score ($\hat{z}_{l}$) for a gene's tissue model ($l$) by dividing the estimated coefficient ($\hat{\gamma}_l$) by its standard error (se($\hat{\gamma}_l$)). For individual-level data analysis, PrediXcan uses this model.

S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics (Equation 2).

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{se(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

In this equation, $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of a gene's predicted expression in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the effect size estimate of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. S-PrediXcan methods always use the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as a reference panel for estimating genotype variances and covariances.

S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1], the summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], models the relationship between a trait and a gene's expression in a single tissue using the univariate model (Equation 1):

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where $\mathbf{t}_l$ represents the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are error terms with variance ${\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}}$. The significance of the association between a gene and a trait is determined by computing the $z$-score ($\hat{z}_{l}$) for each tissue model ($l$) as follows:

$$
\hat{z}_{l} = \frac{\hat{\gamma}_l}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)}.
$$

PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, while S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics and the expression (Equation 2):

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, ${\hat{\sigma}_l}$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. The genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.

S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects, indicating whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk. We utilized these $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).

S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1], a summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], models the relationship between a trait and gene expression in a single tissue using the univariate model (Equation 1). This model represents the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression, with error terms denoted by $\bm{\epsilon}_l$:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,}
\tag{Equation 1}
$$

Where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association between a gene and the trait is determined by calculating the $z$-score ($\hat{z}_{l}$) for the tissue model ($l$) as follows:

$$
\hat{z}_{l} = \frac{\hat{\gamma}_l}{\text{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)}.
$$

PrediXcan requires individual-level data to compute these coefficients, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics and the expression:

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\text{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
\tag{Equation 2}
$$

In this equation, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ denotes the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. The genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as a reference panel.
