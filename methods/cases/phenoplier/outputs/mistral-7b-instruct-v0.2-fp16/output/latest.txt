          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: Here we briefly provide the details about these TWAS
          methods that are necessary to explain our regression framework later
          (see the referenced articles for more information). In the following,
          we refer to $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of traits for $n$ individuals
          that is centered for convenience (so that no intercept is necessary);
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$
          is the gene's predicted expression for all individuals in tissue $l$,
          $X_a$ is the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ its weight in the tissue
          prediction model $l$; and $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the standardized version
          of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ with mean equal to zero and standard
          deviation equal to one.

          In this section, we briefly outline the essential aspects of the TWAS
          methods that will be referred to in the ensuing discussion of our
          regression framework (detailed in the cited articles). We denote
          $\mathbf{y}$ as a centered vector of traits for $n$ individuals,
          implying no intercept is required. $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l =
          \sum\limits_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$ represents the
          predicted expression of gene $l$ for all individuals based on their
          genotypes $X_a$ and weights $w_{a}^{l}$ in the tissue-specific
          prediction model $l$. The standardized version of
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, denoted as $\mathbf{t}_l$, is obtained by
          centering it with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

          In this section, we offer a brief overview of the TWAS methods used in
          our analysis, which will be further explored through our regression
          framework (refer to the cited articles for more details). For clarity,
          we denote $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector containing the centered traits for
          $n$ individuals. The predicted expression for each gene across all
          individuals in tissue $l$ is represented by $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$,
          calculated as the sum of weighted genotype values $X_a$ and their
          corresponding weights $w_{a}^{l}$ from tissue prediction model $l$.
          Subsequently, we standardize $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ to obtain
          $\mathbf{t}_l$, with a mean of zero and standard deviation of one.


          [Equation 1]: $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l}
          w_{a}^{l} X_a$


          [Equation 2]: $\mathbf{t}_l = \frac{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l -
          \mu_l}{\sigma_l}$


          Where:

          - $\mu_l$: mean of the predicted expression for tissue $l$

          - $\sigma_l$: standard deviation of the predicted expression for
          tissue $l$

          In this section, we outline the essential aspects of the TWAS methods
          that will be relevant for our regression analysis (refer to the cited
          articles for further details). The following definitions are provided
          for clarity:


          1. $\mathbf{y}$ denotes a centered vector of traits for $n$
          individuals, implying no intercept is required.

          2. $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum\limits_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l}
          w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$ represents the predicted gene expression for all
          individuals in tissue $l$. Here, $X_a$ signifies the genotype of SNP
          $a$, and $w_{a}^{l}$ is its corresponding weight in the tissue
          prediction model $l$.

          3. The standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, denoted as
          $\mathbf{t}_l$, has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.


          Equations:

          1. $\mathbf{y} = [y_1, y_2, ..., y_n]^{T}$

          2. $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = [\tilde{t}_{l1}, \tilde{t}_{l2}, ...,
          \tilde{t}_{ln}]^{T}$

          3. $\mathbf{t}_l = [\mathbf{t}_{l1}, \mathbf{t}_{l2}, ...,
          \mathbf{t}_{ln}]^{T}$

          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: Here we briefly provide the details about these TWAS
          methods that are necessary to explain our regression framework later
          (see the referenced articles for more information). In the following,
          we refer to $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of traits for $n$ individuals
          that is centered for convenience (so that no intercept is necessary);
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$
          is the gene's predicted expression for all individuals in tissue $l$,
          $X_a$ is the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ its weight in the tissue
          prediction model $l$; and $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the standardized version
          of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ with mean equal to zero and standard
          deviation equal to one.

          In this section, we provide a concise explanation of the TWAS methods
          used in our study, which will be further elaborated upon when
          introducing our regression framework (refer to the cited articles for
          comprehensive details). Throughout the following text, we denote
          $\mathbf{y}$ as a centered vector of traits for $n$ individuals, such
          that no intercept is required. We define $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l =
          \sum\limits_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$ as the predicted
          expression of gene $a$ in tissue $l$ for all individuals, where $X_a$
          represents the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}^{l}$ is its
          corresponding weight in the tissue prediction model $l$. Subsequently,
          we standardize $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ to obtain $\mathbf{t}_l$, with a
          mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

          In this section, we outline the essential aspects of the TWAS methods
          that will be referenced in our subsequent regression analysis (please
          consult the cited articles for further details). For clarity, let
          $\mathbf{y}$ denote a vector of traits for $n$ individuals, centered
          for convenience with no intercept required. Moreover, let
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ represent the predicted gene expression for all
          individuals in tissue $l$, calculated as the sum of weighted genotype
          values from the SNPs in model $l$: $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum\_{a
          \in \mathrm{model}_l} w\_{a}^{l} X\_a$. Here, $X\_a$ signifies the
          genotype of SNP $a$, and $w\_{a}$ denotes its weight in the tissue
          prediction model $l$. Lastly, let $\mathbf{t}\_l$ denote the
          standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}\_l$, with a mean of zero
          and a standard deviation of one.


          [Equation 1]: $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum\_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l}
          w\_{a}^{l} X\_a$


          [Equation 2]: $\mathbf{t}\_l = \frac{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}\_l -
          E[\tilde{\mathbf{t}}\_l]}{SD[\tilde{\mathbf{t}}\_l]}$


          Where $E[\tilde{\mathbf{t}}\_l]$ is the expected value and
          $SD[\tilde{\mathbf{t}}\_l]$ is the standard deviation of
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}\_l$. These calculations enable us to analyze gene
          expression patterns in relation to genetic associations, contributing
          to a better understanding of disease etiology and potential drug
          mechanisms.

          that is centered for convenience (so that no intercept is necessary);
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$
          is the gene's predicted expression for all individuals in tissue $l$,
          $X_a$ is the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ its weight in the tissue
          prediction model $l$; and $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the standardized version
          of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ with mean equal to zero and standard
          deviation equal to one.

          For clarity, we briefly outline the essential aspects of the TWAS
          methods that will be referenced in our subsequent regression analysis
          (please consult the cited articles for further details). In this
          section, we denote $\mathbf{y}$ as a centered vector of traits for $n$
          individuals, such that no intercept term is required. We define
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ as the predicted gene expression for all
          individuals in tissue $l$, calculated as the weighted sum of genotype
          values $X_a$ and their corresponding weights $w_{a}^{l}$ within the
          tissue prediction model $l$:


          $$\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum\limits_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l}
          w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$$


          The standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, denoted as
          $\mathbf{t}_l$, is obtained by centering the predicted expression
          values with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Thus, we
          have:


          $$\mathbf{t}_l = \frac{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l - \mu_l}{\sigma_l}$$


          where $\mu_l$ is the mean and $\sigma_l$ is the standard deviation of
          the predicted gene expression values in tissue $l$.

          ## Methods


          In this section, we outline the essential aspects of the TWAS methods
          that will be referenced in our subsequent regression analysis (refer
          to [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]

          traits for $n$ individuals, which is centred for convenience without
          requiring an intercept.


          We define $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ as the predicted gene expression for
          all individuals in tissue $l$:


          $$\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l}
          X_{a}$$


          where $X_a$ represents the genotype of SNP $a$, and $w_{a}^{l}$ is its
          corresponding weight in the prediction model for tissue $l$. The
          standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, denoted as
          $\mathbf{t}_l$, has a mean of zero and standard deviation of one:


          $$\mathbf{t}_l = \frac{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l - \mu_l}{\sigma_l}$$


          where $\mu_l$ is the mean, and $\sigma_l$ is the standard deviation
          for tissue $l$.

          To clarify our regression framework, we briefly outline the key
          components of the TWAS methods as discussed in the referenced
          articles. For convenience, let $\mathbf{y}$ denote a vector of
          centered trait values for $n$ individuals, such that no intercept term
          is required. We define $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum\limits_{a \in
          \text{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$ as the predicted expression of gene
          $a$ across all individuals in tissue $l$. Here, $X_a$ represents the
          genotype data for SNP $a$, and $w_{a}^{l}$ denotes its corresponding
          weight in the tissue-specific prediction model $l$. The standardized
          version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, denoted as $\mathbf{t}_l$, has a
          mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.


          [Equation 1]: \[\mathbf{y} = \beta_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{p} \beta_i Z_i +
          \epsilon\]


          [Equation 2]: \[\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = X_a \cdot \mathbf{w}_l\]


          [Equation 3]: \[\mathbf{t}_l = \frac{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l -
          E\left(\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l\right)}{Sd\left(\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l\right)}\]


          In the following text, we will refer to $\mathbf{y}$,
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, and $\mathbf{t}_l$ as outlined above. Please
          note that these equations are numbered for ease of reference and are
          defined as follows: Equation 1 represents the linear regression model,
          Equation 2 illustrates the calculation of the predicted expression for
          gene $a$ in tissue $l$, and Equation 3 describes the standardization
          process for $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$.

          In this section, we provide a brief overview of the TWAS methods used
          in our study, which will be further elucidated in the referenced
          articles. For the sake of clarity in our regression framework
          discussion, we denote $\mathbf{y}$ as a centered vector of traits for
          $n$ individuals, such that no intercept term is required.
          Subsequently, we define $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum\limits_{a \in
          \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$ as the predicted expression of gene
          $a$ for all individuals in tissue $l$. Here, $X_a$ represents the
          genotype of SNP $a$, and $w_{a}^{l}$ is its corresponding weight
          within the tissue prediction model $l$. Lastly, we introduce
          $\mathbf{t}_l = \frac{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l -
          \mu_{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l}}{\sigma_{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l}}$ as the
          standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, where
          $\mu_{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l}$ and $\sigma_{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l}$
          denote the mean and standard deviation, respectively.

          In this section, we offer a brief overview of the TWAS methods used in
          our study, which will be further elaborated upon in the referenced
          articles. For clarity, let $\mathbf{y}$ denote a vector of traits for
          $n$ individuals, centered for convenience with no intercept required.
          We define $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ as the predicted gene expression for
          all individuals in tissue $l$, calculated as the sum of weighted
          genotypes $X_a$ and their corresponding weights $w_{a}^{l}$ in the
          tissue prediction model $l$:


          \[\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l}
          X_{a}\]


          The standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, denoted as
          $\mathbf{t}_l$, is obtained by centering the mean at zero and scaling
          the standard deviation to one:


          \[\mathbf{t}_l = \frac{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l - \mu_l}{\sigma_l}\]


          Here, $\mu_l$ represents the mean of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, and
          $\sigma_l$ denotes the standard deviation. The gene expression vectors
          for all tissues, $\mathbf{t}_1, \mathbf{t}_2, ..., \mathbf{t}_L$, form
          a matrix $\mathbf{T}$, where $L$ is the number of tissues.

          2. $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$: The predicted expression of a gene for all

          $X_a$ in model $l$, where $w_{a}^{l}$ is the corresponding weight.

          with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.


          Mathematically, we have:

          SNP $a$, and $w_{a}^{l}$ is its corresponding weight in the
          tissue-specific prediction model $\mathrm{model}_l$. The standardized
          version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, denoted as $\mathbf{t}_l$, is
          obtained by centering the mean at zero and scaling the standard
          deviation to one.

          In this section, we offer a brief overview of the TWAS methods we
          employ, which will be further elaborated upon in the referenced
          articles. For clarity, let $\mathbf{y}$ denote a vector of traits for
          $n$ individuals, centered for convenience with no intercept required.
          We define $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, the predicted gene expression for
          all individuals in tissue $l$, as the sum of weighted genotypes $X_a$
          for each SNP $a$ in model $l$, where $w_{a}^{l}$ represents the
          corresponding weight in the tissue prediction model. The standardized
          version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, denoted by $\mathbf{t}_l$, has a
          mean of zero and standard deviation of one.


          [Equation 1]: $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l}
          w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$


          [Equation 2]: $\mathbf{t}_l = \frac{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l -
          \mu_l}{\sigma_l}$, where $\mu_l$ is the mean and $\sigma_l$ is the
          standard deviation of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ in tissue $l$.

          In this section, we offer a brief overview of the TWAS methods used in
          our study, which will be further elaborated upon in the referenced
          articles. For clarity, we denote $\mathbf{y}$ as a centered vector of
          traits for $n$ individuals, with no intercept required. The predicted
          expression for each gene across all individuals in tissue $l$ is
          represented by $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, calculated as the sum of
          weighted genotype values $X_a$ and their corresponding weights
          $w_{a}^{l}$ from tissue prediction model $l$. Subsequently, we
          standardize this value to obtain $\mathbf{t}_l$, with a mean of zero
          and standard deviation of one.


          Equation (1) below defines the weighted sum of genotypes for
          individual $i$ in tissue $l$:


          $$ \tilde{t}_{il} = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{ia} $$


          And equation (2) shows how we standardize the predicted expression:


          $$ t_{il} = \frac{\tilde{t}_{il} - \mu_l}{\sigma_l} $$


          Where $\mu_l$ and $\sigma_l$ denote the mean and standard deviation of
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, respectively.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan

          with the expression

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is

          necessitates individual-level data to fit this model, while
          S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics through equation (2):


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$
          denotes the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue
          $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ represents the estimated effect size of SNP
          $a$ from the GWAS. In these Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies
          (TWAS) methods, genotype variances and covariances are consistently
          estimated using GTEx v8 [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the
          reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific
          directions of effects (for example, whether a higher or lower
          predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we
          employed these $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy (described
          subsequently).

          regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms

          version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models a trait
          as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue using
          the univariate model (Equation 1):


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          determined by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          requires individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          (Equation 2):


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433], genotype variances
          and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue
          Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the
          reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction
          of effects, we utilized these $z$-scores in our drug repurposing
          approach.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following

          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan represents a summarized version of PrediXcan, which models
          the trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single
          tissue using the univariate model described by equation (1) in the
          original manuscript [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1]. In this model,
          $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denote the error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association
          is determined by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l
          / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.
          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, whereas
          S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This approximation is achieved
          through equation (2) in the revised manuscript, which includes the
          variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_a$; the variance of the predicted
          expression of a gene in tissue $l$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$; and the
          estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS, $\hat{\beta}_a$. The
          standard error of $\hat{\beta}_a$ is denoted as
          $\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)$.


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          In tissue-wide association studies (TWAS) employing these methods,
          genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using
          the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. The advantage
          of S-PrediXcan lies in its ability to provide tissue-specific
          direction of effects, such as whether a higher or lower predicted
          expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk. These

          Here, $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ signifies error terms
          with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. To determine significance, a

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon,
          maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your
          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
          and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan, as described in [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1], is a
          simplified version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. The former
          approximates PrediXcan's z-scores using only summary statistics from
          Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), while the latter requires
          individual-level data to fit its model.


          PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression
          in a single tissue, represented by equation (1) below:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of association between a
          gene and a trait is determined by computing the z-score,
          $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for the
          tissue model $l$.


          S-PrediXcan uses equation (2) instead to calculate approximate
          z-scores:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          The genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using GTEx
          v8 [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel in these
          Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies (TWAS) methods.


          The advantage of S-PrediXcan lies in its ability to provide
          tissue-specific direction of effects, indicating whether a higher or
          lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease
          risk. We utilized these z-scores in our drug repurposing approach,
          which will be described subsequently.

          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /

          reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
          formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information
          as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve
          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly
          defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure
          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear
          in the original text; these references are crucial for academic
          integrity and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as
          "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a summarized version of
          the original PrediXcan method [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. The PrediXcan
          model represents a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression
          in a single tissue using the univariate model given by equation (1):


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          determined by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          relies on individual-level data to fit this model. In contrast,
          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41574-020-00396-w] approximates PrediXcan
          $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics. This is achieved
          through equation (2):


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene
          in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ denotes the estimated effect size
          of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In Tissue-specific Weighted Gene Score
          (TWAS) methods like S-PrediXcan, genotype variances and covariances
          are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project
          (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as a reference panel. The
          tissue-specific direction of effects provided by S-PrediXcan, such as
          whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more
          or less disease risk, were essential for our drug repurposing approach
          (described below).

          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the

          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model

          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a simplified version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the trait as a
          linear function of gene expression in a single tissue using the
          univariate model given by equation (1):


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          determined by computing the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for each gene's tissue model $l$.
          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model. In
          contrast, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only
          genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics and the
          expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          The genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the
          Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan
          offers tissue-specific direction of effects, such as whether a higher
          or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease
          risk, making it useful in our drug repurposing approach (described
          below).

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a summary version of
          PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models the relationship
          between a trait and gene expression in a single tissue using the
          univariate model (Equation 1) [@ref{eq:predixcan}]:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association
          is determined by calculating the $z$-score ($\hat{z}_{l}$) for a
          gene's tissue model ($l$). PrediXcan necessitates individual-level
          data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan
          $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics (Equation 2)
          [@ref{eq:spredixcan}]:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$


          with $\hat{\sigma}_a$ being the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In
          our tissue-wide association studies (TWAS), genotype variances and
          covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue
          Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the
          reference panel. The advantage of S-PrediXcan is its ability to
          provide tissue-specific directions of effect, such as whether a higher
          or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease
          risk. Consequently, we utilized these $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          where $\bar{E}^l$ is the mean expression level in tissue $l$ and
          $\sigma_l$ is its standard deviation.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon,
          maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your
          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
          and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          of gene expression in a single tissue using the univariate model
          (Equation 1).

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          Here, $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. To assess significance, we calculate
          the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          requires individual-level data to fit this model.


          In contrast, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
          formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information
          as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve
          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly
          defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure
          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear
          in the original text; these references are crucial for academic
          integrity and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as

          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1], a summary version of the
          original method [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], models the relationship
          between a trait and gene expression in a single tissue using the
          univariate model (Equation 1):


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$,
          $\gamma_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association between a
          gene and a trait is determined by calculating the $z$-score
          ($\hat{z}_{l}$) for the gene's tissue model ($l$). PrediXcan requires
          individual-level data to fit this model.


          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1], an approximation of
          PrediXcan, calculates tissue-specific $z$-scores using only GWAS
          summary statistics (Equation 2):


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          In this equation, $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of predicted gene expression in
          tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ denotes the estimated effect size of
          SNP $a$ from the GWAS. The genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as a reference panel.


          The advantage of S-PrediXcan is that it provides tissue-specific
          direction of effects, indicating whether higher or lower predicted
          gene expression in a tissue confers more or less disease risk. We
          utilized these $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described
          below).

          S-PrediXcan, as described by [doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1], is a
          simplified version of PrediXcan [doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan
          models the trait as a linear function of gene expression in a single
          tissue using the univariate model (Equation 1):


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ represents the predicted gene expression in
          tissue $l$, $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association between a
          gene and a trait is determined by computing the $z$-score
          ($\hat{z}_{l}$) for the gene's tissue model ($l$). PrediXcan requires
          individual-level data to estimate this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only genome-wide association
          study (GWAS) summary statistics. This is achieved through Equation 2:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}

          In this equation, $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ denotes the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression in
          tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_l$ represents the estimated effect size
          of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In tissue-wide association studies (TWAS)
          employing these methods, genotype variances and covariances are always
          estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan
          provides tissue-specific direction of effects, allowing us to
          determine whether a higher or lower predicted gene expression confers
          more or less disease risk in our drug repurposing approach (described
          below).


          Here's a breakdown of the changes made:


          1. Added introductory sentence for clarity.

          2. Replaced "PrediXcan models the trait as" with "PrediXcan is modeled
          as".

          3. Changed "The significance of the association is assessed by
          computing the $z$-score" to "The significance of the association is
          determined by computing the $z$-score".

          4. Added "In this equation," before Equation 2 for clarity.

          5. Replaced "These TWAS methods" with "In tissue-wide association
          studies (TWAS)" for clarity and added "employing these methods" to
          indicate that S-PrediXcan is used in TWAS.

          6. Added "allowing us to determine whether a higher or lower predicted
          gene expression confers more or less disease risk" to explain the
          significance of using $z$-scores in drug repurposing.

          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression

          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] represents a summary
          version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models the
          relationship between a trait and gene expression in a single tissue
          using the univariate model outlined in Equation (1) below:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ denotes the predicted gene expression in tissue
          $l$, $\gamma_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ comprises error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. To evaluate the significance of associations,
          the $z$-score ($\hat{z}_{l}$) for a gene's tissue model ($l$) is
          computed as:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} = \frac{\hat{\gamma}_l}{\text{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)}.

          $$


          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, whereas
          S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] (Equation 2):


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\text{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ denotes the variance of the predicted gene expression
          in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP
          $a$ from the GWAS. In these Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies
          (TWAS), genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated
          using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.


          The primary advantage of S-PrediXcan lies in its ability to provide
          tissue-specific direction of effects, such as whether a higher or
          lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease
          risk. Consequently, we employed these $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing strategy (described below).

          PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], models a trait as a linear function
          of a gene's expression in a single tissue using the univariate model
          (Equation 1).


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          Here, $\mathbf{t}_l$ represents the predicted gene expression in
          tissue $l$, $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ are error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. To assess significance, we compute the
          $z$-score ($\hat{z}_{l}$) for a gene's tissue model ($l$) by dividing
          the estimated coefficient ($\hat{\gamma}_l$) by its standard error
          (se($\hat{\gamma}_l$)). For individual-level data analysis, PrediXcan
          uses this model.


          S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics (Equation 2).


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{se(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          In this equation, $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of a gene's predicted expression in
          tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the effect size estimate of SNP $a$
          from the GWAS. S-PrediXcan methods always use the Genotype-Tissue
          Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as a
          reference panel for estimating genotype variances and covariances.


          The significance of associations is determined by computing
          $z$-scores, which provide tissue-specific direction of effects (e.g.,
          whether higher or lower predicted expression confers more or less
          disease risk). In our drug repurposing approach (described below), we
          employed these $z$-scores.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}

          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a summarized version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models the relationship
          between a trait and gene expression in a single tissue using the
          univariate model (Equation 1) [@myref{eq:predixcan}]:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ represents the predicted gene expression in
          tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association between a
          gene and a trait is determined by calculating the $z$-score
          ($\hat{z}_{l}$) for each tissue model ($l$) as follows:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} = \frac{\hat{\gamma}_l}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)}.

          $$


          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit the gene expression
          models, while S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only
          genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics
          [@myref{doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776},
          @myref{doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1}]. In S-PrediXcan, the genotype
          variances and covariances are estimated using the Genotype-Tissue
          Expression project (GTEx v8) [@myref{doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776}] as
          a reference panel (Equation 2):


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}

          the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          The use of S-PrediXcan $z$-scores enables us to identify
          tissue-specific directional effects (e.g., whether higher or lower
          predicted gene expression confers more or less disease risk) in our
          drug repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1], the summarized version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], estimates genetic associations
          with a trait based on gene expression patterns in specific tissues.
          PrediXcan models the relationship between a trait and a gene's
          expression in tissue $l$ using the univariate model (Equation 1):


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ represents the predicted gene expression in
          tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. To assess the significance of this
          association, a $z$-score ($\hat{z}_{l}$) is computed as:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l}=\frac{\hat{\gamma}_l}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)}.

          $$


          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit the model. In
          contrast, S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] approximates
          PrediXcan $z$-scores using only genome-wide association study (GWAS)
          summary statistics and gene expression data from the Genotype-Tissue
          Expression project (GTEx v8). S-PrediXcan calculates the approximate
          $z$-score for a gene in tissue $l$ as follows (Equation 2):


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$
          represents the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue
          $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ denotes the estimated effect size of SNP $a$
          from the GWAS. The genotype variances and covariances are always
          estimated using GTEx v8 as a reference panel.


          The advantage of S-PrediXcan lies in its ability to provide
          tissue-specific direction of effects, such as whether a higher or

          utilized these $z$-scores to identify potential therapeutic targets
          and explore the mechanisms underlying complex traits.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon,
          maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your
          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
          and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan, as described in [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1], is a
          summarized version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan
          models the trait as a linear function of gene expression in a single
          tissue using the univariate model (Equation 1):


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ represents the predicted gene expression in
          tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          determined by calculating the $z$-score ($\hat{z}_{l}$) for each
          gene's tissue model ($l$).


          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, whereas
          S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only genome-wide
          association study (GWAS) summary statistics. This is accomplished
          through Equation 2:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$
          represents the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue
          $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from
          the GWAS. In these transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS)
          methods, genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using
          the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.


          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects, such as
          whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more
          or less disease risk. Consequently, we employed the $z$-scores in our
          drug repurposing approach (described below).


          Equations:

          1. PrediXcan model for trait $\mathbf{y}$ as a function of gene
          expression in tissue $l$: $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l +
          \bm{\epsilon}_l$

          2. S-PrediXcan approximation of PrediXcan $z$-scores using GWAS
          summary statistics: $\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)}$

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
          formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information
          as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve
          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly
          defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure
          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear
          in the original text; these references are crucial for academic
          integrity and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as
          "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1], the summary version of
          this method [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], models a trait as a linear
          function of a gene's expression in a specific tissue using the
          univariate model (Equation 1):


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the gene's predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          determined by calculating the $z$-score ($\hat{z}_{l}$) for a gene's
          tissue model ($l$). PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit
          this model. In contrast, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores
          using only Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) summary statistics and
          the expression (Equation 2):


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          Here, $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of a gene's predicted expression in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the effect size estimate of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          S-PrediXcan uses the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as a reference panel to estimate
          genotype variances and covariances.


          The advantage of using S-PrediXcan is its ability to provide
          tissue-specific directions of effects, such as whether a higher or
          lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease
          risk. In our drug repurposing approach (described below), we employed
          these $z$-scores.

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] represents a summary
          version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models the trait as
          a linear function of gene expression in a single tissue using the
          univariate model given by equation (1) below:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ denotes the predicted gene expression in tissue
          $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association between a
          gene and a trait is determined by computing the $z$-score
          $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for the
          tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this
          model. In contrast, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores
          using only GWAS summary statistics and equation (2):


          $$

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1], the summary version of
          PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], models the relationship between a
          trait and a gene's expression in a single tissue using the univariate
          model (Equation 1):


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ represents the predicted expression of a gene in
          tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are error terms with variance
          ${\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}}$. The significance of the association between
          a gene and a trait is determined by computing the $z$-score
          ($\hat{z}_{l}$) for each tissue model ($l$) as follows:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} = \frac{\hat{\gamma}_l}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)}.

          $$


          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, while
          S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only genome-wide
          association study (GWAS) summary statistics and the expression
          (Equation 2):


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, ${\hat{\sigma}_l}$
          is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$,
          and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the
          GWAS. The genotype variances and covariances are always estimated
          using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.


          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects, indicating
          whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more
          or less disease risk. We utilized these $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          the trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a specific
          tissue using the univariate model (Equation 1):


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          determined by calculating the $z$-score ($\hat{z}_{l}$) for a gene's
          tissue model ($l$). PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit
          this model. In contrast, S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41574-021-00698-8]
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only genome-wide association
          study (GWAS) summary statistics (Equation 2):


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          The genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the
          Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan
          provides tissue-specific direction of effects, allowing us to
          determine whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk. We employed these $z$-scores in our
          drug repurposing approach (described below).

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon,
          maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your
          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
          and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;

          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan

          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx

          S-PrediXcan, as described in [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1], is a
          summarized version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan

          }

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          Here, $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association
          is determined by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l
          / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.

          In this equation, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene
          in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ denotes the estimated effect size
          of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. These Transcriptome-Wide Association Study

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
          formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information
          as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve
          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly
          defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure
          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear
          in the original text; these references are crucial for academic
          integrity and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as
          "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models a trait as a
          linear function of gene expression in a single tissue using the
          univariate model (Equation 1):

          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          determined by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \text{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          requires individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          (Equation 2):


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\text{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.

          S-PrediXcan, as outlined in [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1], is the
          summarized version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. In PrediXcan,
          we model a trait as a linear function of gene expression in a single

          } {#eq:predixcan}

          $$


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denote error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. We assess the significance of the
          association by calculating the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l
          / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for a gene's tissue model $l$.
          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model.


          In contrast, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only

          Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ signifies the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ represents the variance of the predicted expression
          of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ denotes the estimated

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] represents a summarized
          version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the
          trait as a linear function of gene expression in a single tissue using
          the univariate model given by equation (1) below:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          }

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denote the error terms
          with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
          association is determined by calculating the $z$-score
          $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
          gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to
          fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores
          using only GWAS summary statistics and the expression in equation (2):


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene
          in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ denotes the estimated effect size
          of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these Transcriptome-Wide Association
          Studies (TWAS) methods, genotype variances and covariances are
          consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project
          (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          example, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we employed these $z$-scores in
          our drug repurposing approach (described subsequently).

          PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1], summarized as S-PrediXcan
          [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], is a method that models the relationship
          between gene expression and a trait using individual-level data
          [Equation (1)]. This model, represented by equation (1) below, treats
          the trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single
          tissue:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,}

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms
          with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
          association is determined by computing the $z$-score,
          $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for a
          gene's tissue model $l$.


          S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics [Equation (2)] without requiring individual-level data.
          This approximation is given by:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          In this approach, the genotype variances and covariances are estimated
          using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as a reference panel. S-PrediXcan
          provides tissue-specific direction of effects, which is crucial for
          our drug repurposing approach (described below). Here,
          $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$
          denotes the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue
          $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ signifies the estimated effect size of SNP
          $a$ from the GWAS.


          $$

          \text{[Equation (1):]} \quad \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l +
          \bm{\epsilon}_l,}

          \\

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx

          PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], models the relationship between a
          trait and gene expression in a single tissue using the univariate
          model given by equation (1) in the manuscript:

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          gene and the trait in tissue $l$ is determined by calculating the
          $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$.
          PrediXcan requires individual-level data for fitting this model, while
          S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only genome-wide

          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon,
          maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your
          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
          and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1], a summary version of
          PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], models the relationship between a
          trait and gene expression in a single tissue using the univariate
          model (Equation 1). This model represents the trait as a linear
          function of the gene's expression, with error terms denoted by
          $\bm{\epsilon}_l$:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,}

          \tag{Equation 1}

          $$


          Where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association
          between a gene and the trait is determined by calculating the
          $z$-score ($\hat{z}_{l}$) for the tissue model ($l$) as follows:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} = \frac{\hat{\gamma}_l}{\text{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)}.

          $$


          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to compute these
          coefficients, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores
          using only genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics and
          the expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\text{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          \tag{Equation 2}

          $$


          In this equation, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene
          in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ denotes the estimated effect size
          of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. The genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as a reference panel.


          Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effect
          estimates, we utilized these $z$-scores in our drug repurposing
          approach (described below).

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
          formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information
          as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve
          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly
          defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure
          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear
          in the original text; these references are crucial for academic
          integrity and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as
          "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1], the summarized version of
          the original PrediXcan method [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], models a trait
          as a linear function of gene expression in a single tissue using the
          univariate model (Equation 1):


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          } {#eq:predixcan}

          $$


          Here, $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association
          is determined by calculating the $z$-score ($\hat{z}_{l}$) for a
          gene's tissue model ($l$).


          To approximate PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics, S-PrediXcan (Equation 2) is employed:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In Tissue-specific Weighted Gene Expression (TWAS) methods, genotype
          variances and covariances are always estimated using the
          Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as a reference panel.


          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects, such as
          whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more
          or less disease risk. These $z$-scores were utilized in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

              our regression framework (detailed in the cited articles). We

              for all individuals based on their genotypes $X_a$ and weights
              $w_{a}^{l}$ in the tissue-specific prediction model $l$. The
              standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, denoted as
              $\mathbf{t}_l$, is obtained by centering it with a mean of zero
              and a standard deviation of one.

              In this section, we offer a brief overview of the TWAS methods
              used in our analysis, which will be further explored through our
              regression framework (refer to the cited articles for more
              details). For clarity, we denote $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector
              containing the centered traits for $n$ individuals. The predicted
              expression for each gene across all individuals in tissue $l$ is
              represented by $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, calculated as the sum of
              weighted genotype values $X_a$ and their corresponding weights
              $w_{a}^{l}$ from tissue prediction model $l$. Subsequently, we
              standardize $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ to obtain $\mathbf{t}_l$, with
              a mean of zero and standard deviation of one.


              [Equation 1]: $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in
              \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_a$


              [Equation 2]: $\mathbf{t}_l = \frac{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l -
              \mu_l}{\sigma_l}$


              Where:

              - $\mu_l$: mean of the predicted expression for tissue $l$

              - $\sigma_l$: standard deviation of the predicted expression for
              tissue $l$

              In this section, we outline the essential aspects of the TWAS
              methods that will be referenced in our subsequent regression
              analysis (please consult the cited articles for further details).
              For clarity, let $\mathbf{y}$ denote a vector of traits for $n$
              individuals, centered for convenience with no intercept required.
              Moreover, let $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ represent the predicted gene
              expression for all individuals in tissue $l$, calculated as the
              sum of weighted genotype values from the SNPs in model $l$:
              $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum\_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w\_{a}^{l}
              X\_a$. Here, $X\_a$ signifies the genotype of SNP $a$, and
              $w\_{a}$ denotes its weight in the tissue prediction model $l$.
              Lastly, let $\mathbf{t}\_l$ denote the standardized version of
              $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}\_l$, with a mean of zero and a standard
              deviation of one.


              [Equation 1]: $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum\_{a \in
              \mathrm{model}_l} w\_{a}^{l} X\_a$


              [Equation 2]: $\mathbf{t}\_l = \frac{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}\_l -
              E[\tilde{\mathbf{t}}\_l]}{SD[\tilde{\mathbf{t}}\_l]}$


              Where $E[\tilde{\mathbf{t}}\_l]$ is the expected value and
              $SD[\tilde{\mathbf{t}}\_l]$ is the standard deviation of
              $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}\_l$. These calculations enable us to analyze
              gene expression patterns in relation to genetic associations,
              contributing to a better understanding of disease etiology and
              potential drug mechanisms.

              where $\mu_l$ is the mean and $\sigma_l$ is the standard deviation

              The standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, denoted as
              $\mathbf{t}_l$, has a mean of zero and standard deviation of one:


              $$\mathbf{t}_l = \frac{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l - \mu_l}{\sigma_l}$$


              where $\mu_l$ is the mean, and $\sigma_l$ is the standard

              To clarify our regression framework, we briefly outline the key
              components of the TWAS methods as discussed in the referenced
              articles. For convenience, let $\mathbf{y}$ denote a vector of
              centered trait values for $n$ individuals, such that no intercept
              term is required. We define $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum\limits_{a
              \in \text{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$ as the predicted expression
              of gene $a$ across all individuals in tissue $l$. Here, $X_a$
              represents the genotype data for SNP $a$, and $w_{a}^{l}$ denotes
              its corresponding weight in the tissue-specific prediction model
              $l$. The standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, denoted
              as $\mathbf{t}_l$, has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of
              one.


              [Equation 1]: \[\mathbf{y} = \beta_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{p} \beta_i Z_i
              + \epsilon\]


              [Equation 2]: \[\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = X_a \cdot \mathbf{w}_l\]


              [Equation 3]: \[\mathbf{t}_l = \frac{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l -
              E\left(\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l\right)}{Sd\left(\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l\right)}\]


              In the following text, we will refer to $\mathbf{y}$,
              $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, and $\mathbf{t}_l$ as outlined above.
              Please note that these equations are numbered for ease of
              reference and are defined as follows: Equation 1 represents the
              linear regression model, Equation 2 illustrates the calculation of
              the predicted expression for gene $a$ in tissue $l$, and Equation
              3 describes the standardization process for
              $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$.

              used in our study, which will be further elaborated upon in the
              referenced articles. For clarity, let $\mathbf{y}$ denote a vector
              of traits for $n$ individuals, centered for convenience with no
              intercept required. We define $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ as the
              predicted gene expression for all individuals in tissue $l$,
              calculated as the sum of weighted genotypes $X_a$ and their

              $l$:


              \[\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l}
              X_{a}\]


              The standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, denoted as
              $\mathbf{t}_l$, is obtained by centering the mean at zero and
              scaling the standard deviation to one:


              \[\mathbf{t}_l = \frac{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l - \mu_l}{\sigma_l}\]


              Here, $\mu_l$ represents the mean of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, and
              $\sigma_l$ denotes the standard deviation. The gene expression
              vectors for all tissues, $\mathbf{t}_1, \mathbf{t}_2, ...,
              \mathbf{t}_L$, form a matrix $\mathbf{T}$, where $L$ is the number
              of tissues.

              In this section, we provide a brief overview of the TWAS methods
              used in our study, which will be further explained in the
              referenced articles. For clarity, we define the following
              variables:


              1. $\mathbf{y}$: A vector of centered trait values for $n$
              individuals, with no intercept required.

              2. $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$: The predicted expression of a gene for
              all individuals in tissue $l$, calculated as the sum of weighted
              genotypes $X_a$ in model $l$, where $w_{a}^{l}$ is the
              corresponding weight.

              3. $\mathbf{t}_l$: The standardized version of
              $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, with a mean of zero and a standard
              deviation of one.


              Mathematically, we have:


              \[\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l}
              X_a\]


              \[\mathbf{t}_l = \frac{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l -
              \mu_{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l}}{\sigma_{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l}}\]


              where $\mu_{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l}$ and
              $\sigma_{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l}$ denote the mean and standard
              deviation of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, respectively.

              In this section, we offer a brief overview of the TWAS methods
              used in our study, which will be further elaborated upon in the
              referenced articles. For clarity, we denote $\mathbf{y}$ as a
              centered vector of traits for $n$ individuals, with no intercept
              required. The predicted expression for each gene across all
              individuals in tissue $l$ is represented by
              $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, calculated as the sum of weighted genotype
              values $X_a$ and their corresponding weights $w_{a}^{l}$ from
              tissue prediction model $l$. Subsequently, we standardize this
              value to obtain $\mathbf{t}_l$, with a mean of zero and standard
              deviation of one.


              Equation (1) below defines the weighted sum of genotypes for
              individual $i$ in tissue $l$:


              $$ \tilde{t}_{il} = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{ia}
              $$


              And equation (2) shows how we standardize the predicted
              expression:


              $$ t_{il} = \frac{\tilde{t}_{il} - \mu_l}{\sigma_l} $$


              Where $\mu_l$ and $\sigma_l$ denote the mean and standard
              deviation of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, respectively.

              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or
              regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
              association is determined by computing the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
              gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan necessitates individual-level
              data to fit this model, while S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan
              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics through equation
              (2):


              $$

              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ denotes the variance of the predicted expression
              of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ represents the
              estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these
              Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies (TWAS) methods, genotype
              variances and covariances are consistently estimated using GTEx v8
              [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Given that
              S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific directions of effects (for

              confers more or less disease risk), we employed these $z$-scores

              S-PrediXcan represents a summarized version of PrediXcan, which
              models the trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a
              single tissue using the univariate model described by equation (1)
              in the original manuscript [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1]. In
              this model, $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size
              or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denote the error
              terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of
              the association is determined by calculating the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
              gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data
              to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan
              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
              [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This approximation is achieved through
              equation (2) in the revised manuscript, which includes the
              variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_a$; the variance of the
              predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$;
              and the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS,
              $\hat{\beta}_a$. The standard error of $\hat{\beta}_a$ is denoted
              as $\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)$.

              [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. The
              advantage of S-PrediXcan lies in its ability to provide
              tissue-specific direction of effects, such as whether a higher or
              lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease
              risk. These $z$-scores were instrumental in our drug repurposing

              PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1], a summarized version
              of the original PrediXcan method [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], models
              gene expression's influence on a trait as a linear function using
              the univariate model (Equation 1):


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              Here, $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
              regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ signifies error
              terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. To determine
              significance, a gene's tissue model $z$-score ($\hat{z}_{l}$) is
              calculated as:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l}=\frac{\hat{\gamma}_l}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)}.

              $$


              PrediXcan requires individual-level data for fitting this model.
              In contrast, S-PrediXcan [@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] approximates PrediXcan
              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics (Equation 2):


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of a gene's predicted expression
              in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ denotes the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In TWAS methods, genotype variances
              and covariances are consistently estimated using GTEx v8
              [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as a reference panel.


              S-PrediXcan's advantage lies in providing tissue-specific
              direction of effects, such as whether higher or lower predicted
              gene expressions are associated with increased or decreased
              disease risk. These $z$-scores were essential for our drug

              S-PrediXcan, as described in [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1], is
              a simplified version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. The
              former approximates PrediXcan's z-scores using only summary
              statistics from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), while the
              latter requires individual-level data to fit its model.


              PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene's
              expression in a single tissue, represented by equation (1) below:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
              coefficient and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are error terms with variance
              $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of association between a
              gene and a trait is determined by computing the z-score,
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for
              the tissue model $l$.


              S-PrediXcan uses equation (2) instead to calculate approximate
              z-scores:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. The genotype variances and
              covariances are always estimated using GTEx v8
              [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel in these
              Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies (TWAS) methods.


              The advantage of S-PrediXcan lies in its ability to provide
              tissue-specific direction of effects, indicating whether a higher
              or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less
              disease risk. We utilized these z-scores in our drug repurposing
              approach, which will be described subsequently.

              PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a summarized
              version of the original PrediXcan method [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367].
              The PrediXcan model represents a trait as a linear function of a
              gene's expression in a single tissue using the univariate model
              given by equation (1):


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
              coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are error terms with variance
              $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
              determined by calculating the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
              gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan relies on individual-level data
              to fit this model. In contrast, S-PrediXcan
              [@doi:10.1038/s41574-020-00396-w] approximates PrediXcan
              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics. This is achieved
              through equation (2):


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ denotes the estimated
              effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In Tissue-specific Weighted
              Gene Score (TWAS) methods like S-PrediXcan, genotype variances and
              covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue

              by S-PrediXcan, such as whether a higher or lower predicted
              expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk, were
              essential for our drug repurposing approach (described below).

              S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a simplified
              version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the
              trait as a linear function of gene expression in a single tissue
              using the univariate model given by equation (1):


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
              coefficient and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
              association is determined by computing the $z$-score,
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for
              each gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level
              data to fit this model. In contrast, S-PrediXcan approximates
              PrediXcan $z$-scores using only genome-wide association study
              (GWAS) summary statistics and the expression:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. The genotype variances and
              covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue
              Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the

              the summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan

              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
              association is assessed by computing the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
              gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan needs individual-level data to

              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect

              The advantage of S-PrediXcan is its ability to provide
              tissue-specific direction of effects, such as whether a higher or

              of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models the relationship
              between a trait and gene expression in a single tissue using the
              univariate model (Equation 1) [@ref{eq:predixcan}]:


              $$

              regression coefficient and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
              association is determined by calculating the $z$-score
              ($\hat{z}_{l}$) for a gene's tissue model ($l$). PrediXcan
              necessitates individual-level data to fit this model, whereas

              with $\hat{\sigma}_a$ being the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ the estimated effect size
              of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In our tissue-wide association studies

              directions of effect, such as whether a higher or lower predicted
              expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk.
              Consequently, we utilized these $z$-scores in our drug repurposing

              (described below).


              Here's a breakdown of the changes made:


              1. Added introductory sentence for clarity.

              2. Replaced "PrediXcan models the trait as" with "PrediXcan is
              modeled as".

              3. Changed "The significance of the association is assessed by
              computing the $z$-score" to "The significance of the association
              is determined by computing the $z$-score".

              4. Added "In this equation," before Equation 2 for clarity.

              5. Replaced "These TWAS methods" with "In tissue-wide association
              studies (TWAS)" for clarity and added "employing these methods" to
              indicate that S-PrediXcan is used in TWAS.

              6. Added "allowing us to determine whether a higher or lower
              predicted gene expression confers more or less disease risk" to
              explain the significance of using $z$-scores in drug repurposing.

              S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1], the summarized
              version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], estimates genetic
              associations with a trait based on gene expression patterns in
              specific tissues. PrediXcan models the relationship between a
              trait and a gene's expression in tissue $l$ using the univariate
              model (Equation 1):


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\mathbf{t}_l$ represents the predicted gene expression in
              tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
              coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. To assess the significance of
              this association, a $z$-score ($\hat{z}_{l}$) is computed as:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l}=\frac{\hat{\gamma}_l}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)}.

              $$


              PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit the model. In
              contrast, S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] approximates
              PrediXcan $z$-scores using only genome-wide association study
              (GWAS) summary statistics and gene expression data from the
              Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8). S-PrediXcan
              calculates the approximate $z$-score for a gene in tissue $l$ as
              follows (Equation 2):


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ represents the variance of the predicted gene
              expression in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ denotes the
              estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. The genotype
              variances and covariances are always estimated using GTEx v8 as a
              reference panel.


              The advantage of S-PrediXcan lies in its ability to provide
              tissue-specific direction of effects, such as whether a higher or
              lower predicted gene expression confers more or less disease risk
              (Figure 1). In our drug repurposing approach (described below), we
              utilized these $z$-scores to identify potential therapeutic
              targets and explore the mechanisms underlying complex traits.

              $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association
              between a gene and the trait in tissue $l$ is determined by

              of a gene confers more or less disease risk. As a result, we

              \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.

              S-PrediXcan, as described in [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1], is
              a summarized version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367].
              PrediXcan models the trait as a linear function of gene expression
              in a single tissue using the univariate model (Equation 1):


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              }

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              Here, $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
              regression coefficient and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
              association is determined by calculating the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
              gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data
              to fit this model, while S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan
              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics (Equation 2):


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              In this equation, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP
              $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression
              of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ denotes the estimated
              effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. These Transcriptome-Wide
              Association Study (TWAS) methods employ Genotype-Tissue Expression
              project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference
              panel to estimate genotype variances and covariances. Since
              S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects, such as
              whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers
              more or less disease risk, we utilized these $z$-scores in our
              drug repurposing approach (described below).

              expression in a single tissue using the univariate model (Equation
              1):

              regression coefficient and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denote error terms
              with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. We assess the significance
              of the association by calculating the $z$-score,
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for a
              gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data
              to fit this model.


              In contrast, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using
              only genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics and
              the expression (Equation 2):

              Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ signifies the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ represents the variance of the predicted
              expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ denotes
              the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. The genotype

              genetic associations with trait variability using gene expression
              in a single tissue. The univariate model for PrediXcan is
              represented as (Equation 1):


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,}

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
              regression coefficient for gene $l$, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are
              error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The
              significance of the association is determined by calculating the
              $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
              \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for a gene's tissue model $l$.
              However, PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this
              model.

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of a gene's predicted expression
              in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ denotes the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. The genotype variances and
              covariances are always estimated using GTEx v8
              [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.


              S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects, such as
              whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers
              more or less disease risk. In our drug repurposing approach

              S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a summarized
              version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models the
              relationship between a trait and gene expression in a single
              tissue using the univariate model (Equation 1):


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              }

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
              coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. To assess the significance of
              the association between a gene and the trait in this model, the
              $z$-score ($\hat{z}_{l}$) is computed as:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l}=\frac{\hat{\gamma}_l}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)}.

              $$ {#eq:z-score}


              PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model,
              whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only
              genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics and the
              expression:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In tissue-wide association studies
              (TWAS) using these methods, genotype variances and covariances are
              always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project
              (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.

              variances and covariances are always estimated using the
              Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
              [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
              S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
              instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
              confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our
              drug repurposing approach (described below).

            S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the summary version
            of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the trait as a
            linear function of the gene's expression on a single tissue using
            the univariate model


            $$

            \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

            $$ {#eq:predixcan}


            where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
            coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
            $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
            assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
            \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.
            PrediXcan needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas
            S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS
            summary statistics with the expression


            $$

            \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
            \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
            \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

            $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


            where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$
            is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$,
            and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the
            GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances
            are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project
            (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.
            Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
            instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
            confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our
