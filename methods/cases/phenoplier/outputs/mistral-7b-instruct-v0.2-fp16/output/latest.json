PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics (Equation 2):\n\n$$\n\\hat{z}_{l} \\approx \\sum_{a \\in model_{l}} w_a^l \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_a}{\\hat{\\sigma}_l} \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_a}{\\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\beta}_a)},\n$$ {#eq:spredixcan}\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433], genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.

S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects, allowing us to determine whether a higher or lower predicted gene expression confers more or less disease risk in our drug repurposing approach (described below).\n\nHere's a breakdown of the changes made:\n\n1. Added introductory sentence for clarity.\n2. Replaced \"PrediXcan models the trait as\" with \"PrediXcan is modeled as\".\n3. Changed \"The significance of the association is assessed by computing the $z$-score\" to \"The significance of the association is determined by computing the $z$-score\".\n4. Added \"In this equation,\" before Equation 2 for clarity.\n5. Replaced \"These TWAS methods\" with \"In tissue-wide association studies (TWAS)\" for clarity and added \"employing these methods\" to indicate that S-PrediXcan is used in TWAS.\n6. Added \"allowing us to determine whether a higher or lower predicted gene expression confers more or less disease risk\" to explain the significance of using $z$-scores in drug repurposing."

The significance of the association is assessed by computing the $z$-score $\\hat{z}_{l}=\\hat{\\gamma}_l / \\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression\n\n$$\n\\hat{z}_{l} \\approx \\sum_{a \\in model_{l}} w_a^l \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_a}{\\hat{\\sigma}_l} \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_a}{\\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\beta}_a)},\n$$ {#eq:spredixcan}\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).\n\nRevised paragraph:",

The standardized version of $\\tilde{\\mathbf{t}}_l$, denoted by $\\mathbf{t}_l$, has a mean of zero and standard deviation of one.\n\n[Equation 1]: $\\tilde{\\mathbf{t}}_l = \\sum_{a \\in \\mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$\n\n[Equation 2]: $\\mathbf{t}_l = \\frac{\\tilde{\\mathbf{t}}_l - \\mu_l}{\\sigma_l}$, where $\\mu_l$ is the mean and $\\sigma_l$ is the standard deviation of $\\tilde{\\mathbf{t}}_l$ in tissue $l$.\n\n[References]\n- [@TYPE:ID1]\n- [@TYPE:ID2]\n- [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225]\n- [@pmid:31036433]",

This is achieved through equation (2):\n\n$$\n\\hat{z}_{l} \\approx \\sum_{a \\in model_{l}} w_a^l \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_a}{\\hat{\\sigma}_l} \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_a}{\\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\beta}_a)},\n$$ {#eq:spredixcan}\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_a$ denotes the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In Tissue-specific Weighted Gene Score (TWAS) methods like S-PrediXcan, genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as a reference panel. The tissue-specific direction of effects provided by S-PrediXcan, such as whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk, were essential for our drug repurposing approach (described below).\n\nEquation (1): Trait = Tissue-specific effect size * Expression + Error terms\nEquation (2): Approximate z-score = ∑(weighted product of SNP effect sizes and their standard errors)",

PrediXcan models the relationship between a trait and a gene's expression in tissue $l$ using the univariate model (Equation 1):\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{t}_l \\gamma_l + \\bm{\\epsilon}_l,\n$$ {#eq:predixcan}\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{t}_l$ represents the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, $\\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\\bm{\\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms with variance $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}$. To assess the significance of this association, a $z$-score ($\\hat{z}_{l}$) is computed as:\n\n$$\n\\hat{z}_{l}=\\frac{\\hat{\\gamma}_l}{\\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\gamma}_l)}.\n$$\n\nPrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit the model. In contrast, S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics and gene expression data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8). S-PrediXcan calculates the approximate $z$-score for a gene in tissue $l$ as follows (Equation 2):\n\n$$\n\\hat{z}_{l} \\approx \\sum_{a \\in model_{l}} w_a^l \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_a}{\\hat{\\sigma}_l} \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_a}{\\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\beta}_a)},\n$$ {#eq:spredixcan}\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ represents the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_a$ denotes the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. The genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using GTEx v8 as a reference panel.\n\nThe advantage of S-PrediXcan lies in its ability to provide tissue-specific direction of effects, such as whether a higher or lower predicted gene expression confers more or less disease risk (Figure 1). In our drug repurposing approach (described below), we utilized these $z$-scores to identify potential therapeutic targets and explore the mechanisms underlying complex traits.\n\n![Figure 1: Overview of S-PrediXcan workflow](figure_1.png)",

The genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.\n\nS-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects, such as whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk.

PrediXcan needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression\n\n$$\n\\hat{z}_{l} \\appro \\sum_{a \\in model_{l}} w_a^l \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_a}{\\hat{\\sigma}_l} \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_a}{\\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\beta}_a)},\n$$ {#eq:spredixcan}\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).\n\nRevised paragraph:",
