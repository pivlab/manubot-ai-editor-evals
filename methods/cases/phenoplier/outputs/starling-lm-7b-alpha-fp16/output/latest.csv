Here, we provide a brief overview of the TWAS methods that will be essential for understanding our regression framework later (refer to the cited articles for more details). We define the following variables: $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of traits for $n$ individuals, centered for convenience (no intercept is necessary); $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$, which represents the gene's predicted expression for all individuals in tissue $l$; $X_a$, the genotype of SNP $a$; and $w_{a}$, its weight in the tissue prediction model $l$. Additionally, we standardize $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ to obtain $\mathbf{t}_l$, with mean equal to zero and standard deviation equal to one.

Here are some key equations that you may find helpful:

1. $\mathbf{y}$ is a vector of traits for $n$ individuals, centered as follows: $$\mathbf{y} = \begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\ y_2 \\ \vdots \\ y_n \end{bmatrix}.$$
2. The gene's predicted expression for all individuals in tissue $l$ is given by $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$: $$\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a} = \begin{bmatrix} \tilde{t}_{1l} \\ \tilde{t}_{2l} \\ \vdots \\ \tilde{t}_{nl} \end{bmatrix}.$$
3. The standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ is denoted as $\mathbf{t}_l$: $$\mathbf{t}_l = \begin{bmatrix} t_{1l} \\ t_{2l} \\ \vdots \\ t_{nl} \end{bmatrix},$$ where $t_{il} = \frac{\tilde{t}_{il} - \bar{\tilde{t}}_l}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (\tilde{t}_{il} - \bar{\tilde{t}}_l)^2}},$ with $\bar{\tilde{t}}_l$ being the mean of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$.

where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression

where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).","genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits",Preserves numbered equations and references to articles,Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms,"[PASS] (0.78)

S-PrediXcan is an abbreviated version of PrediXcan, which uses a linear function to model a trait based on a gene's expression in a single tissue. The univariate model is represented by the equation:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is determined by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression:

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific directions of effects, indicating whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk. We utilized these $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).

S-PrediXcan is the simplified version of PrediXcan, and it uses only GWAS summary statistics to approximate PrediXcan's $z$-scores. The linear model in PrediXcan is represented by:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the gene's predicted expression in tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. To determine the significance of the association, a $z$-score is computed for each gene's tissue model:

$$
\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l).
$$ {#eq:z-score}

S-PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, while PrediXcan does not. In TWAS methods like S-PrediXcan, the genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776]. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (e.g., whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (explained later).

In order to approximate PrediXcan's $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics, S-PrediXcan uses the expression:

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.

In summary, S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan that uses only GWAS summary statistics to approximate PrediXcan's $z$-scores. It estimates genotype variances and covariances using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel, providing tissue-specific direction of effects for drug repurposing purposes.

S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a streamlined version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a linear function of gene expression in a single tissue using the univariate model:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is determined by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. Unlike PrediXcan, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression:

S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan, which uses genetic data to model how a trait is related to gene expression in a single tissue. The relationship is represented by the equation [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1]:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. To determine if a gene's expression in a tissue is significantly associated with a trait, the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ is calculated for each gene's tissue model $l$. However, S-PrediXcan can approximate these $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics and the expression:

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. When using TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using GTEx v8 as the reference panel [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776]. S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (e.g., whether higher or lower predicted gene expression confers more or less disease risk), which we utilized in our drug repurposing approach (described below).
