          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: Here we briefly provide the details about these TWAS
          methods that are necessary to explain our regression framework later
          (see the referenced articles for more information). In the following,
          we refer to $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of traits for $n$ individuals
          that is centered for convenience (so that no intercept is necessary);
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$
          is the gene's predicted expression for all individuals in tissue $l$,
          $X_a$ is the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ its weight in the tissue
          prediction model $l$; and $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the standardized version
          of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ with mean equal to zero and standard
          deviation equal to one.

          Here we briefly provide the details about these TWAS methods that are
          necessary to explain our regression framework later (see the
          referenced articles for more information). In the following, we refer
          to $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of traits for $n$ individuals that is
          centered for convenience (so that no intercept is necessary);
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$

          In this study, we concisely outline the TWAS methods employed, which
          are essential for elucidating our regression framework later (refer to
          the cited articles for further details). Hereinafter, we denote
          $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of traits for $n$ individuals that has been
          centered for convenience (thus eliminating the need for an intercept
          term); $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l}
          X_{a}$ represents the predicted gene expression for all individuals in
          tissue $l$, where $X_a$ signifies the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$
          denotes its weight within the tissue-specific prediction model $l$;
          and $\mathbf{t}_l$ refers to the standardized version of
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, with mean equal to zero and standard deviation
          equal to one.


          Explanation: The revised paragraph maintains the original content
          while improving readability by rephrasing sentences, using more
          concise language, and providing clearer definitions for variables.

          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly
          defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure
          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear

          Here we briefly outline the necessary details about the TWAS methods,
          which will be explained in more depth later through referenced
          articles. In the following, we denote $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of
          traits for $n$ individuals that is centered for convenience (i.e., no
          intercept is needed); $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in
          \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$ refers to the predicted gene
          expression for all individuals in tissue $l$, where $X_a$ is the
          genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ represents its weight in the tissue
          prediction model $l$; and $\mathbf{t}_l$ stands for the standardized
          version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, with a mean of zero and a standard
          deviation of one.


          Here are the equations used in the paragraph:


          1. $\mathbf{y}$ is a vector of traits for $n$ individuals that is
          centered for convenience:
             $$\mathbf{y} = [y_1, y_2, ..., y_n]$$

          2. The gene's predicted expression for all individuals in tissue $l$:
             $$\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$$

          3. The standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, with a mean of
          zero and a standard deviation of one:
             $$\mathbf{t}_l = \frac{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l - \mu_{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l}}{\sigma_{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l}}$$

          4. In the paragraph, the following reference to a scientific article
          is kept exactly as it appears in the original text: "[@pmid:33931583;

          2. Technical details such as mathematical expressions have been
          maintained.

          3. Equations (e.g., $\mathbf{y}$, $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, and
          $\mathbf{t}_l$) have been preserved and correctly defined.

          4. References to numbered equations are intact, e.g., "refer to the
          cited articles."

          5. The majority of references to scientific articles have been kept

          In this section, we concisely outline the key aspects of the TWAS
          methods that are essential for elucidating our regression framework
          later (refer to the cited articles for a comprehensive understanding).
          We denote $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of traits for $n$ individuals,
          which is centered for convenience (thus eliminating the need for an
          intercept term); $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l}
          w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$ represents the predicted expression of a gene for all
          individuals in tissue $l$, where $X_a$ signifies the genotype of SNP
          $a$ and $w_{a}$ is its weight within the tissue-specific prediction
          model $l$; and $\mathbf{t}_l$ denotes the standardized version of
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, with a mean of zero and a standard deviation
          of one.

          Here, we provide a brief overview of the TWAS methods that will be
          essential for understanding our regression framework later (refer to
          the cited articles for more details). We define the following
          variables: $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of traits for $n$ individuals,
          centered for convenience (no intercept is necessary);
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l}
          X_{a}$, which represents the gene's predicted expression for all
          individuals in tissue $l$; $X_a$, the genotype of SNP $a$; and
          $w_{a}$, its weight in the tissue prediction model $l$. Additionally,
          we standardize $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ to obtain $\mathbf{t}_l$, with
          mean equal to zero and standard deviation equal to one.


          Here are some key equations that you may find helpful:


          1. $\mathbf{y}$ is a vector of traits for $n$ individuals, centered as
          follows: $$\mathbf{y} = \begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\ y_2 \\ \vdots \\ y_n
          \end{bmatrix}.$$

          2. The gene's predicted expression for all individuals in tissue $l$
          is given by $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$: $$\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a
          \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a} = \begin{bmatrix} \tilde{t}_{1l}
          \\ \tilde{t}_{2l} \\ \vdots \\ \tilde{t}_{nl} \end{bmatrix}.$$

          3. The standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ is denoted as
          $\mathbf{t}_l$: $$\mathbf{t}_l = \begin{bmatrix} t_{1l} \\ t_{2l} \\
          \vdots \\ t_{nl} \end{bmatrix},$$ where $t_{il} = \frac{\tilde{t}_{il}
          - \bar{\tilde{t}}_l}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (\tilde{t}_{il} -
          \bar{\tilde{t}}_l)^2}},$ with $\bar{\tilde{t}}_l$ being the mean of
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$.

          4. The genotype of SNP $a$ is represented by $X_a$, and its weight in
          the tissue prediction model $l$ is denoted as $w_{a}^{l}$.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic

          following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
          formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information
          as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve
          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly
          defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure
          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear
          in the original text; these references are crucial for academic
          integrity and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as

          methods that are necessary to explain our regression framework later
          (see the referenced articles for more information). In the following,
          we refer to $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of traits for $n$ individuals
          that is centered for convenience (so that no intercept is necessary);
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$
          is the gene's predicted expression for all individuals in tissue $l$,
          $X_a$ is the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ its weight in the tissue
          prediction model $l$; and $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the standardized version
          of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ with mean equal to zero and standard
          deviation equal to one.

          Here, we briefly outline the key aspects of the TWAS methods that are
          essential for understanding our regression framework later (see the
          referenced articles for more details). Specifically, we denote
          $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector representing traits for $n$ individuals,
          which is centered for convenience (i.e., no intercept is needed);
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$
          represents the predicted gene expression for all individuals in tissue
          $l$, where $X_a$ is the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ is its weight
          in the tissue prediction model $l$; and $\mathbf{t}_l$ denotes the
          standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, with mean equal to
          zero and standard deviation equal to one.


          Here are some additional points to consider when revising the
          paragraph:


          1. Preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal
          changes to the text: The revised paragraph maintains the same
          structure and content as the original paragraph.

          2. Preserve technical details such as mathematical expressions: The
          revised paragraph retains all mathematical expressions from the
          original paragraph, including the notation for $\mathbf{y}$,
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, and $\mathbf{t}_l$.

          3. Ensure that equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and
          correctly defined: Although no equations are explicitly numbered in
          this paragraph, the revised paragraph maintains the correct
          definitions of the mathematical expressions.

          4. Preserve references to numbered equations: Since there are no
          numbered equations in this paragraph, this point is not applicable.
          However, if any numbered equations were present, they would be
          preserved as-is in the revised paragraph.

          5. Ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as
          they appear in the original text: The revised paragraph retains all
          references to scientific articles from the original text, using the
          same format (e.g., "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;
          @pmid:31036433]").

          for convenience (i.e., no intercept is necessary);
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$
          denotes the predicted gene expression for all individuals in tissue
          $l$, where $X_a$ represents the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ is its
          weight in the tissue prediction model $l$; and $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the
          standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, with a mean of zero
          and a standard deviation of one.

          convenience (no intercept is necessary); $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l =
          \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$, which represents the
          gene's predicted expression for all individuals in tissue $l$; $X_a$,
          the genotype of SNP $a$; and $w_{a}$, its weight in the tissue

          standard deviation equal to one.

          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l

          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug

          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan

          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model,
          S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics with the equation:


          $$

          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ denotes the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of a gene's predicted expression in
          tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ represents the estimated effect size
          of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, genotype variances
          and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue
          Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as a
          reference panel. S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific directions of
          effects, such as whether higher or lower predicted gene expression
          confers greater or lesser disease risk. As a result, we employed the
          $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy (detailed below).

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).


          Revised paragraph:

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the streamlined
          version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a
          linear function of gene expression in a single tissue using the
          univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. To assess the significance of the
          association, the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ is computed for a gene's tissue model
          $l$. However, PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this
          model, while S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only
          GWAS summary statistics with the expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ denotes the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene
          in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP
          $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, genotype variances and
          covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue
          Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the
          reference panel. As S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific directions of
          effects (e.g., whether higher or lower predicted gene expression
          confers greater or lesser disease risk), we incorporated the
          $z$-scores into our drug repurposing strategy (detailed below).

          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /

          requires individual-level data to fit this model, while S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of a gene's predicted expression in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are always
          estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (e.g.,
          whether a higher or lower predicted gene expression confers more or
          less disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing
          approach (explained below).

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon,
          maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your
          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
          and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;

          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance

          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /

          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
          formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information
          as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve
          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly
          defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure
          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear
          in the original text; these references are crucial for academic
          integrity and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as
          "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a simplified version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models a trait as a
          linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue using the
          following univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          In this equation, $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect
          size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error
          terms with a variance of $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of
          the association is determined by calculating the $z$-score
          $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
          gene's tissue model $l$. However, PrediXcan requires individual-level
          data to fit this model. S-PrediXcan, on the other hand, approximates
          PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the
          following expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          In this equation, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene
          in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP
          $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, genotype variances and
          covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression
          project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference
          panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects
          (for example, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a streamlined version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a linear
          function of a gene's expression in a single tissue using the
          univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ represents the gene's predicted expression in
          tissue $l$, $\beta_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The association's significance is assessed by
          calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. Unlike
          PrediXcan, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only
          GWAS summary statistics with the expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of a gene's predicted expression in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are
          consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project
          (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. As
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (e.g.,
          whether higher or lower predicted gene expression confers greater or
          lesser disease risk), we employed $z$-scores in our drug repurposing
          strategy (detailed below).

          and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;

          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a simplified version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models a trait as a
          linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue using the
          univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the gene's predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The association's significance is determined
          by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. While
          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model,
          S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics with the expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are always
          estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the streamlined
          version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a simplified version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models a trait as a
          linear function of gene expression in a single tissue using the
          univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size (regression coefficient), and
          $\epsilon_l$ are error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. To
          assess the significance of an association, a $z$-score
          $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ is computed
          for a gene's tissue model $l$. However, PrediXcan requires
          individual-level data to fit this model. S-PrediXcan, on the other
          hand, approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics with the expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          For these transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) methods,
          genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the
          Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific effect directions (e.g., whether
          a higher or lower predicted gene expression confers more or less
          disease risk), we used these $z$-scores in our drug repurposing
          approach (described below).

          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a streamlined version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a linear
          function of a gene's expression in a single tissue using the

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ represents the gene's predicted expression in
          tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. To assess the significance of the
          association, a $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ is computed for each gene's tissue model
          $l$. Unlike PrediXcan, S-PrediXcan requires only GWAS summary

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
          formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information
          as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve
          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly
          defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure
          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear
          in the original text; these references are crucial for academic
          integrity and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as

          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l

          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a streamlined version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a linear
          function of a gene's expression in a single tissue using the
          univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the gene's predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The association's significance is determined
          by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. While
          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model,
          S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics with the expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are
          consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project
          (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. As
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific directions of effects (e.g.,
          whether higher or lower predicted gene expression confers greater or
          lesser disease risk), we employed $z$-scores in our drug repurposing
          strategy (described below).

          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan is the simplified version of PrediXcan, and it uses only
          GWAS summary statistics to approximate PrediXcan's $z$-scores. The
          linear model in PrediXcan is represented by:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the gene's predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. To determine the significance of the
          association, a $z$-score is computed for each gene's tissue model:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l).

          $$ {#eq:z-score}


          S-PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, while
          PrediXcan does not. In TWAS methods like S-PrediXcan, the genotype
          variances and covariances are always estimated using the
          Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776]. Since S-PrediXcan provides
          tissue-specific direction of effects (e.g., whether a higher or lower
          predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we
          used the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (explained
          later).


          In order to approximate PrediXcan's $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics, S-PrediXcan uses the expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.


          In summary, S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan that uses
          only GWAS summary statistics to approximate PrediXcan's $z$-scores. It
          estimates genotype variances and covariances using the Genotype-Tissue
          Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel, providing
          tissue-specific direction of effects for drug repurposing purposes.

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a streamlined version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a linear
          function of gene expression in a single tissue using the univariate
          model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ represents the predicted gene expression in
          tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The association's significance is assessed by
          calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. Unlike
          PrediXcan, S-PrediXcan requires only GWAS summary statistics to

          S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan
          [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. In PrediXcan,
          a trait is modeled as a linear function of a gene's expression in a
          single tissue using the univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the gene's predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size (regression coefficient), and
          $\epsilon_l$ are error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$.
          The significance of the association is determined by calculating the
          $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$
          for a gene's tissue model $l$. However, PrediXcan requires
          individual-level data to fit this model. S-PrediXcan, on the other
          hand, approximates PrediXcan's $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics with the expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of a gene's predicted expression in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are always
          estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan
          provides tissue-specific directions of effects, such as whether a
          higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less
          disease risk. Therefore, we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).


          Here are the changes made to the original paragraph:


          1. Replaced "S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan" with "S-PrediXcan is a simplified
          version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1;
          @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]."

          2. Replaced "PrediXcan models the trait as a linear function of the
          gene's expression on a single tissue using the univariate model" with
          "In PrediXcan, a trait is modeled as a linear function of a gene's
          expression in a single tissue using the univariate model".

          3. Replaced "The significance of the association is assessed by
          computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$." with "The
          significance of the association is determined by calculating the
          $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$
          for a gene's tissue model $l$."

          4. Replaced "PrediXcan needs individual-level data to fit this model,
          whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS
          summary statistics with the expression" with "However, PrediXcan
          requires individual-level data to fit this model. S-PrediXcan, on the
          other hand, approximates PrediXcan's $z$-scores using only GWAS
          summary statistics with the expression".

          5. Replaced "Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel." with "genotype
          variances and covariances are always estimated using the

          6. Replaced "Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of
          effects (for instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression
          of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores"

          maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your
          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the summary version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the trait as a
          linear function of the gene's expression on a single tissue using the
          univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a streamlined version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a linear
          function of a gene's expression in a single tissue using the
          univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          determined by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          necessitates individual-level data to fit this model, whereas
          S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics via:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ signifies the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of a gene's predicted expression in
          tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ represents the estimated effect size
          of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, genotype variances
          and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue
          Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as a
          reference panel. S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of
          effects, such as whether higher or lower predicted gene expression
          confers greater or lesser disease risk; thus, we employed $z$-scores
          in our drug repurposing strategy (described in the subsequent
          section).

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ signifies the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denote the error terms
          with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The association's significance
          is assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.


          S-PrediXcan, on the other hand, approximates PrediXcan's $z$-scores
          using only GWAS summary statistics. The expression is:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$
          represents the variance of a gene's predicted expression in tissue
          $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ denotes the estimated effect size of SNP $a$
          from the GWAS. In TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.


          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects, such as
          whether higher or lower predicted gene expression confers more or less
          disease risk. For this reason, we employed the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (detailed below).

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a streamlined version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a linear
          function of gene expression in a single tissue using the univariate
          model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The association's significance is assessed by
          calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. Unlike
          PrediXcan, S-PrediXcan requires only GWAS summary statistics to
          approximate PrediXcan $z$-scores with the expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ represents the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from
          the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances
          are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression
          project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as a reference panel.
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific effect directions (e.g., whether
          higher or lower predicted gene expression confers greater or lesser
          disease risk), which we utilized in our drug repurposing approach
          (described below).

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon,
          maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your
          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
          and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan is the simplified version of PrediXcan, which uses
          individual-level data to fit a linear model relating a trait to gene
          expression in a single tissue. This model is represented by the
          equation:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association
          is assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. 


          S-PrediXcan, on the other hand, approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores
          using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the
          GWAS. 


          In these TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are always
          estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan
          provides tissue-specific direction of effects, allowing us to
          determine whether a higher or lower predicted gene expression confers
          more or less disease risk in our drug repurposing approach (described
          below).

          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression

          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a simplified version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models a trait as a
          linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue using the
          univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size (regression
          coefficient), and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. To assess the significance of the
          association, a $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ is calculated for each gene's tissue
          model $l$. For PrediXcan to work, individual-level data is required.
          S-PrediXcan, on the other hand, approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores
          using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.

          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity

          following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
          formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information
          as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve
          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly
          defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure
          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).


          Revised paragraph:

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a streamlined version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a linear
          function of gene expression in a single tissue using the univariate
          model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          determined by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. Unlike
          PrediXcan, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only
          GWAS summary statistics with the expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          These TWAS methods use genotype variances and covariances, which are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. As
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (e.g.,
          whether higher or lower predicted gene expression confers greater or
          lesser disease risk), we employed $z$-scores in our drug repurposing
          approach (detailed below).

          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan, which uses genetic
          data to model how a trait is related to gene expression in a single
          tissue. The relationship is represented by the equation
          [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1]:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. To determine if a gene's expression in a
          tissue is significantly associated with a trait, the $z$-score
          $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ is
          calculated for each gene's tissue model $l$. However, S-PrediXcan can
          approximate these $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics and
          the expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          When using TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are always
          estimated using GTEx v8 as the reference panel
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776]. S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific
          direction of effects (e.g., whether higher or lower predicted gene
          expression confers more or less disease risk), which we utilized in
          our drug repurposing approach (described below).

              In this study, we concisely outline the TWAS methods employed,
              which are essential for elucidating our regression framework later
              (refer to the cited articles for further details). Hereinafter, we
              denote $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of traits for $n$ individuals that
              has been centered for convenience (thus eliminating the need for
              an intercept term); $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in
              \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$ represents the predicted gene
              expression for all individuals in tissue $l$, where $X_a$
              signifies the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ denotes its weight
              within the tissue-specific prediction model $l$; and
              $\mathbf{t}_l$ refers to the standardized version of
              $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, with mean equal to zero and standard
              deviation equal to one.


              Explanation: The revised paragraph maintains the original content
              while improving readability by rephrasing sentences, using more
              concise language, and providing clearer definitions for variables.

              Here we briefly outline the necessary details about the TWAS
              methods, which will be explained in more depth later through
              referenced articles. In the following, we denote $\mathbf{y}$ as a
              vector of traits for $n$ individuals that is centered for
              convenience (i.e., no intercept is needed); $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l
              = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$ refers to the
              predicted gene expression for all individuals in tissue $l$, where
              $X_a$ is the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ represents its weight
              in the tissue prediction model $l$; and $\mathbf{t}_l$ stands for
              the standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, with a mean of
              zero and a standard deviation of one.


              Here are the equations used in the paragraph:


              1. $\mathbf{y}$ is a vector of traits for $n$ individuals that is
              centered for convenience:
                 $$\mathbf{y} = [y_1, y_2, ..., y_n]$$

              2. The gene's predicted expression for all individuals in tissue
              $l$:
                 $$\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$$

              3. The standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, with a mean
              of zero and a standard deviation of one:
                 $$\mathbf{t}_l = \frac{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l - \mu_{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l}}{\sigma_{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l}}$$

              4. In the paragraph, the following reference to a scientific
              article is kept exactly as it appears in the original text:
              "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;

              Here, we briefly provide the necessary details about these TWAS
              methods that will be explained later in our regression framework
              (refer to the cited articles for more information). In what
              follows, we define $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of traits for $n$
              individuals, which is centered for convenience (no intercept is
              necessary); $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l}
              w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$ represents the gene's predicted expression for
              all individuals in tissue $l$, where $X_a$ denotes the genotype of
              SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ is its weight in the tissue prediction model
              $l$; and $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the standardized version of
              $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, with a mean of zero and a standard
              deviation of one.


              Here are some key points to note about the revised paragraph:


              1. The original information has been preserved as much as
              possible, with minimal changes to the text.

              2. Technical details such as mathematical expressions have been
              maintained.

              3. Equations (e.g., $\mathbf{y}$, $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, and
              $\mathbf{t}_l$) have been preserved and correctly defined.

              4. References to numbered equations are intact, e.g., "refer to
              the cited articles."

              5. The majority of references to scientific articles have been
              kept exactly as they appear in the original text, such as
              "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;

              Here, we provide a brief overview of the TWAS methods that will be
              essential for understanding our regression framework later (refer
              to the cited articles for more details). We define the following
              variables: $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of traits for $n$ individuals,
              centered for convenience (no intercept is necessary);
              $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l}
              X_{a}$, which represents the gene's predicted expression for all
              individuals in tissue $l$; $X_a$, the genotype of SNP $a$; and
              $w_{a}$, its weight in the tissue prediction model $l$.
              Additionally, we standardize $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ to obtain
              $\mathbf{t}_l$, with mean equal to zero and standard deviation
              equal to one.


              Here are some key equations that you may find helpful:


              1. $\mathbf{y}$ is a vector of traits for $n$ individuals,
              centered as follows: $$\mathbf{y} = \begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\ y_2 \\
              \vdots \\ y_n \end{bmatrix}.$$

              2. The gene's predicted expression for all individuals in tissue
              $l$ is given by $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$: $$\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l =
              \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a} = \begin{bmatrix}
              \tilde{t}_{1l} \\ \tilde{t}_{2l} \\ \vdots \\ \tilde{t}_{nl}
              \end{bmatrix}.$$

              3. The standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ is denoted
              as $\mathbf{t}_l$: $$\mathbf{t}_l = \begin{bmatrix} t_{1l} \\
              t_{2l} \\ \vdots \\ t_{nl} \end{bmatrix},$$ where $t_{il} =
              \frac{\tilde{t}_{il} - \bar{\tilde{t}}_l}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n
              (\tilde{t}_{il} - \bar{\tilde{t}}_l)^2}},$ with
              $\bar{\tilde{t}}_l$ being the mean of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$.

              4. The genotype of SNP $a$ is represented by $X_a$, and its weight
              in the tissue prediction model $l$ is denoted as $w_{a}^{l}$.

              Here, we briefly outline the key aspects of the TWAS methods that
              are essential for understanding our regression framework later
              (see the referenced articles for more details). Specifically, we
              denote $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector representing traits for $n$
              individuals, which is centered for convenience (i.e., no intercept
              is needed); $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l}
              w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$ represents the predicted gene expression for all
              individuals in tissue $l$, where $X_a$ is the genotype of SNP $a$
              and $w_{a}$ is its weight in the tissue prediction model $l$; and
              $\mathbf{t}_l$ denotes the standardized version of
              $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, with mean equal to zero and standard
              deviation equal to one.


              Here are some additional points to consider when revising the
              paragraph:


              1. Preserve the original information as much as possible, with
              minimal changes to the text: The revised paragraph maintains the
              same structure and content as the original paragraph.

              2. Preserve technical details such as mathematical expressions:
              The revised paragraph retains all mathematical expressions from
              the original paragraph, including the notation for $\mathbf{y}$,
              $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, and $\mathbf{t}_l$.

              3. Ensure that equations (which could be numbered) are preserved
              and correctly defined: Although no equations are explicitly
              numbered in this paragraph, the revised paragraph maintains the
              correct definitions of the mathematical expressions.

              4. Preserve references to numbered equations: Since there are no
              numbered equations in this paragraph, this point is not
              applicable. However, if any numbered equations were present, they
              would be preserved as-is in the revised paragraph.

              5. Ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly
              as they appear in the original text: The revised paragraph retains
              all references to scientific articles from the original text,
              using the same format (e.g., "[@pmid:33931583;

              Here, we briefly provide details about these TWAS methods that are
              essential for explaining our regression framework later (see the
              referenced articles for more information). In the following, we
              define $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of traits for $n$ individuals,
              which is centered for convenience (no intercept is necessary);
              $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l}
              X_{a}$ represents the gene's predicted expression for all
              individuals in tissue $l$; $X_a$ denotes the genotype of SNP $a$,
              and $w_{a}$ is its weight in the tissue prediction model $l$.
              Finally, $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the standardized version of
              $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, with mean equal to zero and standard
              deviation equal to one.


              Here are some key points about the revised paragraph:


              1. The original information has been preserved as much as
              possible, with minimal changes to the text.

              2. Technical details such as mathematical expressions have been
              maintained.

              3. Equations have been preserved and correctly defined (e.g.,
              $\mathbf{y}$, $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, $X_a$, and $\mathbf{t}_l$).

              4. References to numbered equations have been preserved.

              5. Most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they
              appear in the original text, ensuring academic integrity (e.g.,
              "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;

              In this section, we provide a brief overview of the TWAS methods
              that are essential for understanding our regression framework
              later (see the referenced articles for more details). We use
              $\mathbf{y}$ to represent a vector of traits for $n$ individuals,
              which is centered for convenience (i.e., no intercept is
              necessary); $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l}
              w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$ denotes the predicted gene expression for all
              individuals in tissue $l$, where $X_a$ represents the genotype of
              SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ is its weight in the tissue prediction model
              $l$; and $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the standardized version of
              $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, with a mean of zero and a standard
              deviation of one.

              S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a streamlined
              version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait
              as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue
              using the univariate model:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or
              regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms
              with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The association's
              significance is assessed by calculating the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
              gene's tissue model $l$. While PrediXcan requires individual-level
              data to fit this model, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan
              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of a gene's predicted expression
              in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of
              SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, genotype variances
              and covariances are consistently estimated using the
              Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
              [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan
              provides tissue-specific directions of effects, such as whether
              higher or lower predicted gene expression confers greater or
              lesser disease risk. As a result, we employed $z$-scores in our
              drug repurposing approach (described below).

              reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
              formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original
              information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text,
              2) preserve technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3)
              ensure that equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and
              correctly defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations,
              and 5) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept
              exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are

              S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the streamlined
              version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait
              as a linear function of gene expression in a single tissue using
              the univariate model:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or
              regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms
              with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. To assess the significance
              of the association, the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
              \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ is computed for a gene's tissue model
              $l$. However, PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this
              model, while S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using
              only GWAS summary statistics with the expression:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ denotes the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, genotype
              variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the
              Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
              [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. As
              S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific directions of effects (e.g.,
              whether higher or lower predicted gene expression confers greater
              or lesser disease risk), we incorporated the $z$-scores into our
              drug repurposing strategy (detailed below).

              version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait

              the association, the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /

              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression:

            S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the summary version
            of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the trait as a
            linear function of the gene's expression on a single tissue using
            the univariate model


            $$

            \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

            $$ {#eq:predixcan}


            where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
            coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
            $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
            assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
            \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.
            PrediXcan needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas
            S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS
            summary statistics with the expression


            $$

            \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
            \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
            \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

            $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


            where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$
            is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$,
            and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the
            GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances
            are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project
            (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.
            Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
            instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
            confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our

              S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a simplified
              version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models a
              trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single
              tissue using the following univariate model:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the
              error terms with a variance of $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The
              significance of the association is determined by calculating the
              $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
              \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.
              However, PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this
              model. S-PrediXcan, on the other hand, approximates PrediXcan
              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the following
              expression:

              of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated

              reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
              formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original
              information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text,
              2) preserve technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3)
              ensure that equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and
              correctly defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations,
              and 5) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept
              exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are
              crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format

              tissue using the univariate model:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the gene's predicted expression in tissue
              $l$, $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
              coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
              $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The association's significance is
              determined by calculating the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
              gene's tissue model $l$. Unlike PrediXcan, S-PrediXcan
              approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
              statistics with the expression:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, genotype
              variances and covariances are always estimated using the
              Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
              [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
              S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific directions of effects (for
              instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
              confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our

              S-PrediXcan is the simplified version of PrediXcan, and it uses
              only GWAS summary statistics to approximate PrediXcan's
              $z$-scores. The linear model in PrediXcan is represented by:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
              $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. To determine the significance of the
              association, a $z$-score is computed for each gene's tissue model:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l).

              $$ {#eq:z-score}


              S-PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model,
              while PrediXcan does not. In TWAS methods like S-PrediXcan, the
              genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the
              Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference
              panel [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776]. Since S-PrediXcan provides
              tissue-specific direction of effects (e.g., whether a higher or
              lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease
              risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach
              (explained later).


              In order to approximate PrediXcan's $z$-scores using only GWAS
              summary statistics, S-PrediXcan uses the expression:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.


              In summary, S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan that
              uses only GWAS summary statistics to approximate PrediXcan's
              $z$-scores. It estimates genotype variances and covariances using
              the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference
              panel, providing tissue-specific direction of effects for drug
              repurposing purposes.

              S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a streamlined
              version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait
              as a linear function of gene expression in a single tissue using
              the univariate model:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\mathbf{t}_l$ represents the predicted gene expression in
              tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
              coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The association's significance
              is assessed by calculating the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
              gene's tissue model $l$. Unlike PrediXcan, S-PrediXcan requires
              only GWAS summary statistics to approximate PrediXcan $z$-scores
              using the expression:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ denotes the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of a gene's predicted expression
              in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_l$ represents the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. Tissue-specific directionality of
              effects (e.g., whether higher or lower predicted gene expression
              confers more or less disease risk) is provided by S-PrediXcan,
              which we utilized in our drug repurposing approach (see below).
              GTEx v8 [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] serves as the reference
              panel for estimating genotype variances and covariances in these

              S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects, such as
              whether higher or lower predicted gene expression confers more or
              less disease risk. For this reason, we employed the $z$-scores in

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining
              the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the
              following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity,
              reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
              formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original
              information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text,
              2) preserve technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3)
              ensure that equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and
              correctly defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations,
              and 5) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept
              exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are
              crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format
              "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;

              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a

              trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single
              tissue using the univariate model:

              coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
              association is assessed by computing the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a

              to fit this model, while S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan
              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression:

              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, genotype

              S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan, which uses
              genetic data to model how a trait is related to gene expression in
              a single tissue. The relationship is represented by the equation
              [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1]:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}

              coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. To determine if a gene's
              expression in a tissue is significantly associated with a trait,
              the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
              \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ is calculated for each gene's tissue
              model $l$. However, S-PrediXcan can approximate these $z$-scores
              using only GWAS summary statistics and the expression:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}

              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. When using TWAS methods, genotype

              provides tissue-specific direction of effects (e.g., whether
              higher or lower predicted gene expression confers more or less
              disease risk), which we utilized in our drug repurposing approach
              (described below).
