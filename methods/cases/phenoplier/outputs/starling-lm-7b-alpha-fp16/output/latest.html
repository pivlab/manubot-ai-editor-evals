Here, we briefly outline the key aspects of the TWAS methods that are essential for understanding our regression framework later (see the referenced articles for more details). Specifically, we denote $&#92;mathbf{y}$ as a vector representing traits for $n$ individuals, which is centered for convenience (i.e., no intercept is needed); $&#92;tilde{&#92;mathbf{t}}_l = &#92;sum_{a &#92;in &#92;mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$ represents the predicted gene expression for all individuals in tissue $l$, where $X_a$ is the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ is its weight in the tissue prediction model $l$; and $&#92;mathbf{t}_l$ denotes the standardized version of $&#92;tilde{&#92;mathbf{t}}_l$, with mean equal to zero and standard deviation equal to one.

Here are some additional points to consider when revising the paragraph:

1. Preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text: The revised paragraph maintains the same structure and content as the original paragraph.
2. Preserve technical details such as mathematical expressions: The revised paragraph retains all mathematical expressions from the original paragraph, including the notation for $&#92;mathbf{y}$, $&#92;tilde{&#92;mathbf{t}}_l$, and $&#92;mathbf{t}_l$.
3. Ensure that equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined: Although no equations are explicitly numbered in this paragraph, the revised paragraph maintains the correct definitions of the mathematical expressions.
4. Preserve references to numbered equations: Since there are no numbered equations in this paragraph, this point is not applicable. However, if any numbered equations were present, they would be preserved as-is in the revised paragraph.
5. Ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text: The revised paragraph retains all references to scientific articles from the original text, using the same format (e.g., &quot;[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]&quot;).

S-PrediXcan is the simplified version of PrediXcan, which uses individual-level data to fit a model. The model is represented by the equation [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression:

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects, allowing us to determine whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk in our drug repurposing approach (described below).

S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the streamlined version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a linear function of gene expression in a single tissue using the univariate model:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

where $\mathbf{t}_l$ represents the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The association's significance is determined by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. Unlike PrediXcan, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression:

$$

S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a simplified version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue using the univariate model:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the gene's predicted expression in tissue $l$, $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The association's significance is determined by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. Unlike PrediXcan, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression:

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific directions of effects (for instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).

S-PrediXcan is the simplified version of PrediXcan, and it uses only GWAS summary statistics to approximate PrediXcan&#39;s $z$-scores. The linear model in PrediXcan is represented by:

$$
&#92;mathbf{y} = &#92;mathbf{t}_l &#92;gamma_l + &#92;bm{&#92;epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where $&#92;mathbf{t}_l$ is the gene&#39;s predicted expression in tissue $l$, $&#92;gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $&#92;epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance $&#92;sigma_{&#92;epsilon}^{2}$. To determine the significance of the association, a $z$-score is computed for each gene&#39;s tissue model:

$$
&#92;hat{z}_{l}=&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l / &#92;mathrm{se}(&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l).
$$ {#eq:z-score}

S-PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, while PrediXcan does not. In TWAS methods like S-PrediXcan, the genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776]. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (e.g., whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (explained later).

In order to approximate PrediXcan&#39;s $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics, S-PrediXcan uses the expression:

$$
&#92;hat{z}_{l} &#92;approx &#92;sum_{a &#92;in model_{l}} w_a^l &#92;frac{&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_a}{&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_l} &#92;frac{&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_a}{&#92;mathrm{se}(&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

where $&#92;hat{&#92;Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.

In summary, S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan that uses only GWAS summary statistics to approximate PrediXcan&#39;s $z$-scores. It estimates genotype variances and covariances using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel, providing tissue-specific direction of effects for drug repurposing purposes.

S-PrediXcan is the simplified version of PrediXcan, and it uses only GWAS summary statistics to approximate PrediXcan's $z$-scores. The linear model in PrediXcan is represented by:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the gene's predicted expression in tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. To determine the significance of the association, a $z$-score is computed for each gene's tissue model:

$$
\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l).
$$ {#eq:z-score}

S-PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, while PrediXcan does not. In TWAS methods like S-PrediXcan, the genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776]. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (e.g., whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (explained later).

In order to approximate PrediXcan's $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics, S-PrediXcan uses the expression:

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.

In summary, S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan that uses only GWAS summary statistics to approximate PrediXcan's $z$-scores. It estimates genotype variances and covariances using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel, providing tissue-specific direction of effects for drug repurposing purposes.

\hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ represents the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as a reference panel. S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific effect directions (e.g., whether higher or lower predicted gene expression confers greater or lesser disease risk), which we utilized in our drug repurposing approach (described below).

S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a simplified version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue using the univariate model:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, while S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression:

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific directions of effects (for instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).

S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a streamlined version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a linear function of gene expression in a single tissue using the univariate model:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is determined by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. Unlike PrediXcan, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression:

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. These TWAS methods use genotype variances and covariances, which are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. As S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (e.g., whether higher or lower predicted gene expression confers greater or lesser disease risk), we employed $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (detailed below).

S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a simplified version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene&#39;s expression in a single tissue using the univariate model:
