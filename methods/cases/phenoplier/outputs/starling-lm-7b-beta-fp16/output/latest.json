S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a simplified version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue using the univariate model:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{t_l \\gamma_l + \\bm{\\epsilon}_l,\n$$ {#eq:predixcan}\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\\bm{\\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}$.

The significance of the association is assessed by computing the $z$-score $\\hat{z}_{l}=\\hat{\\gamma}_l / \\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression\n\n$$\n\\hat{z}_{l} \\approx \\sum_{a \\in model_{l}} w_a^l \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_a}{\\hat{\\sigma}_l} \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_a}{\\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\beta}_a)},\n$$ {#eq:spredixcan}\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).\n\nRevised paragraph:",

PrediXcan needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression\n\n$$\n\\hat{z}_{l} \\approx \\sum_{a \\in model_{l}} w_a^l \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_a}{\\hat{\\sigma}_l} \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_a}{\\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\beta}_a)},\n$$ {#eq:spredixcan}\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).\n\nRevised paragraph:",

S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics and the expression:\n\n$$\n\\hat{z}_{l} \\approx \\sum_{a \\in model_{l}} w_a^l \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_a}{\\hat{\\sigma}_l} \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_a}{\\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\beta}_a)},\n$$ {#eq:spredixcan}\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific directions of effects, indicating whether a higher or lower predicted gene expression confers more or less disease risk. We employed these $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).\n\nIn this revised paragraph, I have preserved the original information and technical details while reducing some jargon and maintaining a scholarly tone.

The significance of the association is assessed by computing the $z$-score $\\hat{z}_{l}=\\hat{\\gamma}_l / \\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.

In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).\n\nRevised paragraph:",

The significance of the association is assessed by computing the $z$-score $\\hat{z}_{l}=\\hat{\\gamma}_l / \\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression\n\n$$\n\\hat{z}_{l} \\approx \\sum_{a \\in model_{l}} w_a^l \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_a}{\\hat{\\sigma}_l} \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_a}{\\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\beta}_a)},\n$$ {#eq:spredixcan}\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).\n\nRevised paragraph:",
