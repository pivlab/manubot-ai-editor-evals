$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression

$$

where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.

S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models a given trait as a linear function of gene expression in a single tissue using a univariate model:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

Here, $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size, or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents error terms with a variance of $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is evaluated by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model. In contrast, S-PrediXcan estimates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics, as shown:

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

In this equation, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) methods, genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. As S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for example, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene increases or decreases disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach, which is detailed in the following section.

\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

Here, $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, while $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms, with a variance of $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is determined by calculating the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model. 

In contrast, S-PrediXcan estimates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics, as per the following expression:

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) methods, the genotype variances and covariances are invariably estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. As S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects, indicating whether a higher or lower predicted gene expression increases or decreases disease risk, we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach, which will be detailed later.

S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] functions as a summary form of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan portrays the trait as a linear function of gene expression in a single tissue, employing a univariate model

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l},
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, while S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores employing only GWAS summary statistics with the expression

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) methods, the genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. As S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for instance, indicating whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene infers more or less disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (explained further below).
