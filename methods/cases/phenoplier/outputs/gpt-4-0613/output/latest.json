Lastly, $\\mathbf{t}_l$ is the standardized form of $\\tilde{\\mathbf{t}}_l$, with a mean value of zero and a standard deviation of one."

PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a specific tissue using a univariate model, as shown below:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{t}_l \\gamma_l + \\bm{\\epsilon}_l,\n$$ {#eq:predixcan}\n\nIn this equation, \\mathbf{t}_l represents the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, $\\beta_l$ stands for the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\\epsilon_l$ denotes the error terms with variance $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score $\\hat{z}_{l}=\\hat{\\gamma}_l / \\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. While PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics, as expressed below:\n\n$$\n\\hat{z}_{l} \\approx \\sum_{a \\in model_{l}} w_a^l \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_a}{\\hat{\\sigma}_l} \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_a}{\\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\beta}_a)},\n$$ {#eq:spredixcan}\n\nIn this expression, $\\hat{\\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. These TWAS methods consistently estimate genotype variances and covariances using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. As S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for example, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene contributes to more or less disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach, which is further explained in the following sections."

In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).\n\nRevised paragraph:",

In these transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) methods, genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.

PrediXcan models the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single tissue using the univariate model\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{t}_l \\gamma_l + \\bm{\\epsilon}_l,\n$$ {#eq:predixcan}\n\nwhere \\mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$, $\\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is assessed by computing the $z$-score $\\hat{z}_{l}=\\hat{\\gamma}_l / \\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression\n\n$$\n\\hat{z}_{l} \\approx \\sum_{a \\in model_{l}} w_a^l \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_a}{\\hat{\\sigma}_l} \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_a}{\\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\beta}_a)},\n$$ {#eq:spredixcan}\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).\n\nRevised paragraph:",

In these transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) methods, the genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.

PrediXcan represents a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a particular tissue, using the univariate model:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{t_l \\gamma_l + \\bm{\\epsilon}_l},\n$$ {#eq:predixcan}\n\nHere, $\\hat{\\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\\bm{\\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with a variance of $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score $\\hat{z}_{l}=\\hat{\\gamma}_l / \\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model. In contrast, S-PrediXcan estimates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics, as defined by:\n\n$$\n\\hat{z}_{l} \\approx \\sum_{a \\in model_{l}} w_a^l \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_a}{\\hat{\\sigma}_l} \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_a}{\\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\beta}_a)},\n$$ {#eq:spredixcan}\n\nIn this equation, $\\hat{\\sigma}_a$ denotes the variance of SNP $a$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) methods, the variances and covariances of genotypes are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. As S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (e.g., whether a higher or lower predicted gene expression increases or decreases disease risk), we utilized these $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach, which is detailed later.",
