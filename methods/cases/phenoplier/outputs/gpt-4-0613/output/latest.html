Here, $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ encapsulates the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for each gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model. In contrast, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics, as expressed in:

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

In this equation, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) methods, genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. As S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects (e.g., whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene increases or decreases disease risk), we incorporated the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach, which is detailed in the following sections.

S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a summary-level version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan conceptualizes the trait as a linear function of a gene&#39;s expression in a single tissue, utilizing a univariate model:

In this equation, $&#92;mathbf{t}_l$ represents the predicted expression of the gene in tissue $l$, $&#92;beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $&#92;epsilon_l$ are the error terms with a variance of $&#92;sigma_{&#92;epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score $&#92;hat{z}_{l}=&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l / &#92;mathrm{se}(&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l)$ for a gene&#39;s tissue model $l$.

S-PrediXcan is a summary version of PrediXcan, as detailed in the source [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1]. PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue, utilizing a univariate model 

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

In this model, \mathbf{t}_l represents the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The association's significance is determined by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model. In contrast, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

Here, $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ denotes the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects, indicating whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk. Consequently, we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach, which is detailed in the following section.

The significance of the association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score $&#92;hat{z}_{l}=&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l / &#92;mathrm{se}(&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l)$ for a gene&#39;s tissue model $l$.

In this equation, $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is assessed by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model. However, S-PrediXcan is able to approximate PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics, as shown in the following equation:

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) methods, the genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as a reference. S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects, indicating whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk. We incorporated these $z$-scores into our drug repurposing approach, which is discussed in a later section.

The significance of the association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, while S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores employing only GWAS summary statistics with the expression

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) methods, the genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. As S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for instance, indicating whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene infers more or less disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (explained further below).
