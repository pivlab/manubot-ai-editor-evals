In this section, we briefly outline the necessary details of the Transcriptome Wide Association Study (TWAS) methods that will be crucial for understanding our regression framework (please refer to the cited articles for further information). We define $&#92;mathbf{y}$ as a vector of $n$ centered trait values, with no intercept required due to centering. Additionally, we define $&#92;tilde{&#92;mathbf{t}}_l = &#92;sum_{a &#92;in &#92;mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$ as the predicted gene expression for all individuals in tissue $l$, where $X_a$ represents the genotype of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) $a$ and $w_{a}$ denotes its weight in the tissue prediction model $l$. Lastly, $&#92;mathbf{t}_l$ is defined as the standardized version of $&#92;tilde{&#92;mathbf{t}}_l$, with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

Please note that throughout this manuscript, we adhere to the following notation:
- Bold lowercase letters denote vectors, such as $&#92;mathbf{y}$ and $&#92;mathbf{t}_l$.
- The symbol $n$ represents the number of individuals in the study.
- Italicized lowercase letters denote scalar values, such as $a$ and $l$.
- Uppercase letters represent matrices, although no matrices are explicitly defined in this paragraph.

Additionally, we would like to emphasize that our TWAS methods build upon previous work in functional genomics and gene co-expression studies (e.g., [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]). Our approach leverages these methods to identify therapeutic targets and facilitate drug repurposing, ultimately contributing to the clustering of complex traits in genetic studies.

The S-PrediXcan methodology, as described by Gamazon et al. (2018) [doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1], represents a summary version of the PrediXcan approach presented by Gamazon et al. (2015) [doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. The PrediXcan method models a trait as a linear function of a gene&#39;s expression in a single tissue, using the univariate model expressed as:

$$&#92;mathbf{y} = &#92;mathbf{t}_l &#92;gamma_l + &#92;bm{&#92;epsilon}_l,$$

where $&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $&#92;bm{&#92;epsilon}_l$ signifies the error terms with variance $&#92;sigma_{&#92;epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score, $&#92;hat{z}_{l}=&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l / &#92;mathrm{se}(&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l)$, for a given tissue model $l$.

In contrast to PrediXcan, which requires individual-level data for fitting this model, S-PrediXcan approximates the PrediXcan $z$-scores by employing only GWAS summary statistics. This approximation is based on the following expression:

$$&#92;hat{z}_{l} &#92;approx &#92;sum_{a &#92;in model_{l}} w_a^l &#92;frac{&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_a}{&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_l} &#92;frac{&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_a}{&#92;mathrm{se}(&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_a)},$$

where $&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$, $&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_l$ denotes the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_a$ signifies the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.

Across both TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as a reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects (e.g., whether an increase or decrease in the predicted expression of a gene correlates with higher or lower disease risk), we utilized these $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy, which is detailed further below.

S-PrediXcan serves as the summary level implementation of PrediXcan. PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene&#39;s expression in a single tissue, utilizing the univariate model represented by Equation 1 in the original text, where $&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $&#92;bm{&#92;epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with variance $&#92;sigma_{&#92;epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score $&#92;hat{z}_{l}=&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l / &#92;mathrm{se}(&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l)$ for a gene&#39;s tissue model $l$. PrediXcan necessitates individual-level data to fit this model, while S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression presented in Equation 2 of the original text. In this equation, $&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$, $&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_l$ denotes the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_a$ signifies the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.

It is important to note that, in both PrediXcan and S-PrediXcan methods, the genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects (such as whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene is associated with increased or decreased disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach, which will be detailed in the following section.

S-PrediXcan serves as the summary level implementation of PrediXcan. PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue, utilizing the univariate model represented by Equation 1 in the original text, where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan necessitates individual-level data to fit this model, while S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression presented in Equation 2 of the original text. In this equation, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ denotes the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ signifies the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.

It is important to note that, in both PrediXcan and S-PrediXcan methods, the genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects (such as whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene is associated with increased or decreased disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach, which will be detailed in the following section.

S-PrediXcan (&quot;Summary PrediXcan&quot;) [[doi:10.38/s41467-018-03621-1](https://doi.org/10.38/s41467-018-03621-1)] is a condensed version of PrediXcan [[doi:10.1038/ng.3367]]. PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene&#39;s expression in a single tissue, using the univariate model represented by Equation ({{eq:predixcan}}) in the original manuscript. Here, $&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l$ signifies the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $&#92;bm{&#92;epsilon}_l$ represents error terms with variance $&#92;sigma_{&#92;epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of an association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score $&#92;hat{z}_{l}=&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l / &#92;mathrm{se}(&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l)$ for a gene&#39;s tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics through the equation:

$$
&#92;hat{z}_{l} &#92;approx &#92;sum_{a &#92;in model_{l}} w_a^l &#92;frac{&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_a}{&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_l} &#92;frac{&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_a}{&#92;mathrm{se}(&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_a)}  {#eq:spredixcan}
$$

where $&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_a$ denotes the variance of SNP $a$, $&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_l$ represents the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and $&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_a$ signifies the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In S-PrediXcan and other TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [[doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776]] as a reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects (for example, whether increased or decreased predicted gene expression corresponds to higher or lower disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy, which is explained in more detail later in this manuscript.

S-PrediXcan [&quot;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1&quot;] is a condensed version of PrediXcan [&quot;doi:10.1038/ng.3367&quot;]. PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene&#39;s expression in a single tissue, employing the univariate model:

$$
&#92;mathbf{y} = &#92;mathbf{t}_l &#92;gamma_l + &#92;bm{&#92;epsilon}_l,
$$ (ef{eq:predixcan})

where $&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $&#92;bm{&#92;epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms with variance $&#92;sigma_{&#92;epsilon}^{2}$. The association&#39;s significance is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score, $&#92;hat{z}_{l}=&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l / &#92;mathrm{se}(&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l)$, for a gene-tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model; however, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics through the expression:

$$
&#92;hat{z}_{l} &#92;approx &#92;sum_{a &#92;in model_{l}} w_a^l &#92;frac{&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_a}{&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_l} &#92;frac{&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_a}{&#92;mathrm{se}(&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_a)},
$$ (ef{eq:spredixcan})

Here, $&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_a$ signifies the variance of SNP $a$, $&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_l$ denotes the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and $&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_a$ represents the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In both TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [&quot;doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776&quot;] as the reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects (such as whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene leads to increased or decreased disease risk), we utilized $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy, which is explained in the following section.

S-PrediXcan serves as the summary variant of PrediXcan and is derived from it. PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue, utilizing the univariate model expressed as:

$$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,$$

where $\mathbf{t}_l$ represents the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ denotes the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for a given tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, while S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics. This is achieved through the expression:

$$\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},$$

where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.

S-PrediXcan (&quot;Summary&quot; PrediXcan) serves as the condensed version of PrediXcan. The latter models a trait as a linear function of a gene&#39;s expression within a single tissue, employing the univariate model outlined in Equation 1:

$$
&#92;mathbf{y} = &#92;mathbf{t}_l &#92;gamma_l + &#92;bm{&#92;epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where &#92;mathbf{t}_l denotes the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, $&#92;beta_l$ signifies the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $&#92;epsilon_l$ represents the error terms with variance $&#92;sigma_{&#92;epsilon}^{2}$. To evaluate the association&#39;s significance, the $z$-score ($&#92;hat{z}_{l}=&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l / &#92;mathrm{se}(&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l)$) is computed for each tissue model ($l$).

Unlike PrediXcan, S-PrediXcan approximates these $z$-scores using solely GWAS summary statistics. This approximation is expressed as:

$$
&#92;hat{z}_{l} &#92;approx &#92;sum_{a &#92;in model_{l}} w_a^l &#92;frac{&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_a}{&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_l} &#92;frac{&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_a}{&#92;mathrm{se}(&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_a)},

S-PrediXcan **[doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1]** is a condensed version of PrediXcan **[doi:10.1038/ng.3367]**. The latter models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue, using the univariate model:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, while S-PrediXcan estimates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics, with the expression:

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In S-PrediXcan and other TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) **[doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776]** as the reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects (for example, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene is associated with increased or decreased disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy, which is detailed below.

PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue, utilizing the univariate model specified in equation (ef{eq:predixcan}) in the Methods section. Here, $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for a given tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics. This is achieved through the expression presented in equation (ef{eq:spredixcan}), where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ denotes the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ represents the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ indicates the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.

It is important to note that, in both TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects (such as whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene is associated with increased or decreased disease risk), we employed the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach, as detailed in the following section.

S-PrediXcan (&quot;Summary PrediXcan&quot;) is a condensed version of PrediXcan, as detailed in [&quot;S-PrediXcan: A method for generating gene-based associations from summary data for 111 human tissues&quot; by Barbeira et al. (2018)][@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1]. PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene&#39;s expression in a single tissue, employing the univariate model described by equation (ef{eq:predixcan}) in the original text. Here, $&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, while $&#92;bm{&#92;epsilon}_l$ denotes error terms with variance $&#92;sigma_{&#92;epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of this association is evaluated through the computation of the $z$-score, represented as $&#92;hat{z}_{l}=&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l / &#92;mathrm{se}(&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l)$, for a gene&#39;s tissue model $l$.

Unlike PrediXcan, which requires individual-level data to fit its models, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics. This is achieved through the expression presented in equation (ef{eq:spredixcan}) of the original text. In this equation, $&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_a$ signifies the variance of SNP $a$, $&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_l$ represents the variance of the predicted gene expression for tissue $l$, and $&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_a$ indicates the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from GWAS.

In S-PrediXcan and other TWAS (Transcriptome Wide Association Study) methods, genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as a reference panel. Due to S-PrediXcan&#39;s ability to provide tissue-specific directions of effects (e.g., whether higher or lower predicted gene expression correlates with increased or decreased disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach, which will be elaborated on later in this manuscript.

S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a condensed version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan represents the trait as a linear function of a single tissue's gene expression using the univariate model:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The association's significance is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for a gene-tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, while S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression:

$$
