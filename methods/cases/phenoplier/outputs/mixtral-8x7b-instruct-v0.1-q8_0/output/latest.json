The significance of an association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score $\\hat{z}_{l}=\\hat{\\gamma}_l / \\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics through the equation:\n\n$$\n\\hat{z}_{l} \\approx \\sum_{a \\in model_{l}} w_a^l \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_a}{\\hat{\\sigma}_l} \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_a}{\\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\beta}_a)}  {#eq:spredixcan}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\sigma}_a$ denotes the variance of SNP $a$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ represents the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_a$ signifies the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In S-PrediXcan and other TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [[doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776]] as a reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects (for example, whether increased or decreased predicted gene expression corresponds to higher or lower disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy, which is explained in more detail later in this manuscript."

The latter models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression within a single tissue, employing the univariate model represented by equation (\ref{eq:predixcan}) in the original text. Here, $\\mathbf{t}_l$ signifies the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, while $\\beta_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression coefficient. The error terms are represented by $\\epsilon_l$, and their variance is given as $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}$.

In contrast, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores by utilizing only GWAS summary statistics, as presented in equation (\ref{eq:spredixcan}). This approximation involves the variance of SNP $a$ ($\\hat{\\Sigma}_a$), the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$ ($\\hat{\\sigma}_l$), and the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS ($\\hat{\\beta}_a$).\n\nIn both TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as a reference panel.

          "output": "S-PrediXcan (\"Summary PrediXcan\") is a condensed version of PrediXcan, as detailed in [\"S-PrediXcan: A method for generating gene-based associations from summary data for 111 human tissues\" by Barbeira et al. (2018)][@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1]. PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue, employing the univariate model described by equation (\ref{eq:predixcan}) in the original text. Here, $\\hat{\\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, while $\\bm{\\epsilon}_l$ denotes error terms with variance $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of this association is evaluated through the computation of the $z$-score, represented as $\\hat{z}_{l}=\\hat{\\gamma}_l / \\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\gamma}_l)$, for a gene's tissue model $l$.\n\nUnlike PrediXcan, which requires individual-level data to fit its models, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics. This is achieved through the expression presented in equation (\ref{eq:spredixcan}) of the original text. In this equation, $\\hat{\\sigma}_a$ signifies the variance of SNP $a$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ represents the variance of the predicted gene expression for tissue $l$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_a$ indicates the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from GWAS.\n\nIn S-PrediXcan and other TWAS (Transcriptome Wide Association Study) methods, genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as a reference panel. Due to S-PrediXcan's ability to provide tissue-specific directions of effects (e.g., whether higher or lower predicted gene expression correlates with increased or decreased disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach, which will be elaborated on later in this manuscript.\n\n[@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1]: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1\n[@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]: https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3367\n[@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776]: https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaz1776"

PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue, employing the univariate model expressed as equation (\ref{eq:predixcan}) in the original text. Here, $\\hat{\\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\\bm{\\epsilon}_l$ signifies the error terms with variance $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}$. To evaluate the significance of the association, S-PrediXcan calculates the $z$-score ($\\hat{z}_{l}=\\hat{\\gamma}_l / \\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\gamma}_l)$) based on a gene's tissue model ($l$).\n\nIn contrast to PrediXcan, which requires individual-level data to fit its model, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics. This approximation is given by the expression in equation (\ref{eq:spredixcan}) of the original text and involves the following variables: $\\hat{\\sigma}_a$ (the variance of SNP $a$), $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ (the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$), and $\\hat{\\beta}_a$ (the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS). In S-PrediXcan and related TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [\"A reference panel for tissue-specific genetic effects across 44 human tissues\" by The GTEx Consortium, Science (2020) doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.\n\nGiven that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects (for example, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene is associated with increased or decreased disease risk), we utilized $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy, which will be explained in the following section."

The PrediXcan method models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue, using the univariate model expressed as:\n\n$$\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{t}_l \\gamma_l + \\bm{\\epsilon}_l,$$\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\\bm{\\epsilon}_l$ signifies the error terms with variance $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}$.

This approximation is based on the following expression:\n\n$$\\hat{z}_{l} \\approx \\sum_{a \\in model_{l}} w_a^l \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_a}{\\hat{\\sigma}_l} \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_a}{\\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\beta}_a)},$$\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ denotes the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_a$ signifies the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.\n\nAcross both TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as a reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects (e.g., whether an increase or decrease in the predicted expression of a gene correlates with higher or lower disease risk), we utilized these $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy, which is detailed further below.",

PrediXcan represents the trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue, employing the univariate model:\n\n$$\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{t}_l \\gamma_l + \\bm{\\epsilon}_l,$$ {#eq:predixcan}\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\\bm{\\epsilon}_l$ signifies the error terms with variance $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}$.

PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, while S-PrediXcan estimates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics, with the following formula:\n\n$$\\hat{z}_{l} \\approx \\sum_{a \\in model_{l}} w_a^l \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_a}{\\hat{\\sigma}_l} \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_a}{\\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\beta}_a)},$$ {#eq:spredixcan}\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In S-PrediXcan and other TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [[doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaz1776)] as a reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects (such as whether an increase or decrease in the predicted expression of a gene is associated with higher or lower disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores for our drug repurposing strategy, which will be detailed in the subsequent section.",

Here, $\\hat{\\gamma}_l$ signifies the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\\bm{\\epsilon}_l$ represents error terms with variance $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of an association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score $\\hat{z}_{l}=\\hat{\\gamma}_l / \\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.

In S-PrediXcan and other TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [[doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776]] as a reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects (for example, whether increased or decreased predicted gene expression corresponds to higher or lower disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy, which is explained in more detail later in this manuscript.",

This is achieved through the expression presented in Equation 2 of the original manuscript:\n\n$$\n\\hat{z}_{l} \\approx \\sum_{a \\in model_{l}} w_a^l \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_a}{\\hat{\\sigma}_l} \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_a}{\\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\beta}_a)},\n$$ {#eq:spredixcan}\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.\n\nIn S-PrediXcan and other TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Due to S-PrediXcan's ability to provide tissue-specific direction of effects, such as whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene is associated with more or less disease risk, we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).",

The latter models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue, using the univariate model:\n\n$$\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{t}_l \\gamma_l + \\bm{\\epsilon}_l,$$ {#eq:predixcan}\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\\bm{\\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}$.

In S-PrediXcan, as well as other TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [[doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaz1776)] as the reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects (for example, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene is associated with greater or lesser disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy, which will be detailed in the following section.",

In both TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) *[doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776]* as a reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects (for example, whether increased or decreased predicted gene expression corresponds to greater or lesser disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy (described below).",

PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression within a single tissue, employing the univariate model defined by equation (\ref{eq:predixcan}) in the original text. Here, $\\mathbf{t}_l$ represents the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, $\\gamma_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\\epsilon_l$ signifies the error terms with variance $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of this association is gauged through the computation of the $z$-score ($\\hat{z}_{l}=\\hat{\\gamma}_l / \\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\gamma}_l)$) for a gene's tissue model ($l$).\n\nIn contrast to PrediXcan, which requires individual-level data to fit the model, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores by utilizing only GWAS summary statistics. This approximation is expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\hat{z}_{l} \\approx \\sum_{a \\in model_{l}} w_a^l \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_a}{\\hat{\\sigma}_l} \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_a}{\\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\beta}_a)},\n$$ {#eq:spredixcan}\n\nHere, $\\hat{\\Sigma}_a$ signifies the variance of SNP $a$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ denotes the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_a$ represents the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.\n\nIn both S-PrediXcan and PrediXcan, the genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as a reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific directions of effects (for example, whether higher or lower predicted expression of a gene leads to increased or decreased disease risk), we utilized these $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy, as explained in the subsequent sections.\n\nPlease note: The original text contained several references, which have been preserved and integrated into the revised paragraph using the format \"[@TYPE:ID]\" such as \"[@doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225]\".",

The significance of the association is assessed by computing the $z$-score $\\hat{z}_{l}=\\hat{\\gamma}_l / \\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression\n\n$$\n\\hat{z}_{l} \\approx \\sum_{a \\in model_{l}} w_a^l \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_a}{\\hat{\\sigma}_l} \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_a}{\\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\beta}_a)},\n$$ {#eq:spredixcan}\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).\n\nRevised paragraph:",

The significance of this association is gauged by calculating the $z$-score $\\hat{z}_{l}=\\hat{\\gamma}_l / \\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit its model, while S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics. This approximation is expressed as:\n\n$$\\hat{z}_{l} \\appro \\sum_{a \\in model_{l}} w_a^l \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_a}{\\hat{\\sigma}_l} \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_a}{\\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\beta}_a)} $$ {#eq:spredixcan}\n\nHere, $\\hat{\\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ denotes the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_a$ signifies the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In both TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [\"A reference data set for gene-association analysis in human tissues\" ([@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776])] as a reference panel. Due to S-PrediXcan's ability to provide tissue-specific directions of effects (such as whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene is associated with increased or decreased disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach, which will be described subsequently.",

(2018)][@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1]. PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue, employing the univariate model described by equation (\ref{eq:predixcan}) in the original text. Here, $\\hat{\\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, while $\\bm{\\epsilon}_l$ denotes error terms with variance $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of this association is evaluated through the computation of the $z$-score, represented as $\\hat{z}_{l}=\\hat{\\gamma}_l / \\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\gamma}_l)$, for a gene's tissue model $l$.\n\nUnlike PrediXcan, which requires individual-level data to fit its models, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics. This is achieved through the expression presented in equation (\ref{eq:spredixcan}) of the original text. In this equation, $\\hat{\\sigma}_a$ signifies the variance of SNP $a$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ represents the variance of the predicted gene expression for tissue $l$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_a$ indicates the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from GWAS.\n\nIn S-PrediXcan and other TWAS (Transcriptome Wide Association Study) methods, genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as a reference panel. Due to S-PrediXcan's ability to provide tissue-specific directions of effects (e.g., whether higher or lower predicted gene expression correlates with increased or decreased disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach, which will be elaborated on later in this manuscript.\n\n[@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1]: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1\n[@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]: https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3367\n[@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776]: https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaz1776",

PrediXcan represents the trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue, employing the univariate model:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{t_l \\gamma_l + \\bm{\\epsilon}_l,\n$$ {#eq:predixcan}\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\\bm{\\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with variance $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score, $\\hat{z}_{l}=\\hat{\\gamma}_l / \\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\gamma}_l)$, for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, while S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the formula:\n\n$$\n\\hat{z}_{l} \\approx \\sum_{a \\in model_{l}} w_a^l \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_a}{\\hat{\\sigma}_l} \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_a}{\\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\beta}_a)},\n$$ {#eq:spredixcan}\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In S-PrediXcan and other TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [[doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaz1776)] as the reference panel.
