Lastly, $\mathbf{t}_l$ is defined as the standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

Please note that throughout this manuscript, we adhere to the following notation:
- Bold lowercase letters denote vectors, such as $\mathbf{y}$ and $\mathbf{t}_l$.
- The symbol $n$ represents the number of individuals in the study.
- Italicized lowercase letters denote scalar values, such as $a$ and $l$.
- Uppercase letters represent matrices, although no matrices are explicitly defined in this paragraph.

Additionally, we would like to emphasize that our TWAS methods build upon previous work in functional genomics and gene co-expression studies (e.g., [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]).

where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression

(2015) [doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. The PrediXcan method models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue, using the univariate model expressed as:

$$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,$$

where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ signifies the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for a given tissue model $l$.

In contrast to PrediXcan, which requires individual-level data for fitting this model, S-PrediXcan approximates the PrediXcan $z$-scores by employing only GWAS summary statistics. This approximation is based on the following expression:

$$\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},$$

where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ denotes the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ signifies the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.

Across both TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as a reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects (e.g., whether an increase or decrease in the predicted expression of a gene correlates with higher or lower disease risk), we utilized these $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy, which is detailed further below.

S-PrediXcan (""Summary PrediXcan"")[^doi:10.3892/ijo.2018.4657], an abbreviated version of PrediXcan[^doi:10.1038/ng.3367], models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue, employing the univariate model expressed as:

S-PrediXcan serves as the summary level implementation of PrediXcan. PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue, utilizing the univariate model represented by Equation 1 in the original text, where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan necessitates individual-level data to fit this model, while S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression presented in Equation 2 of the original text. In this equation, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ denotes the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ signifies the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.

It is important to note that, in both PrediXcan and S-PrediXcan methods, the genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects (such as whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene is associated with increased or decreased disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach, which will be detailed in the following section.

S-PrediXcan serves as the summary variant of PrediXcan and is described in [doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1]. PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue, using the univariate model specified in equation (ef{eq:predixcan}), where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression coefficient and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for a given tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model. In contrast, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics, according to the expression

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In S-PrediXcan, as well as other TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects, such as whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene is associated with increased or decreased disease risk, we utilized $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy, which is detailed in the following section.

The association's significance is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.

In contrast to PrediXcan, which requires individual-level data to fit the model, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics. This is achieved through the expression presented in Eq. (ef{eq:spredixcan}) of the manuscript, where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ denotes the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ represents the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ signifies the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.

Across both TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects (such as whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene is associated with increased or decreased disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy, which will be detailed in the following section.

S-PrediXcan (""Summary"" PrediXcan) serves as the condensed version of PrediXcan. The latter models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression within a single tissue, employing the univariate model represented by equation (ef{eq:predixcan}) in the original text. Here, $\mathbf{t}_l$ signifies the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, while $\beta_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression coefficient. The error terms are represented by $\epsilon_l$, and their variance is given as $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. An association's significance is evaluated through the computation of the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for a gene's tissue model $l$.

PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit its model. In contrast, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores by utilizing only GWAS summary statistics, as presented in equation (ef{eq:spredixcan}). This approximation involves the variance of SNP $a$ ($\hat{\Sigma}_a$), the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$ ($\hat{\sigma}_l$), and the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS ($\hat{\beta}_a$).

In both TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as a reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific directions of effects – for example, whether an increased or decreased predicted expression of a gene correlates with higher or lower disease risk – we utilized these $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy, which is detailed further below.

S-PrediXcan (""Summary PrediXcan"") serves as the abbreviated version of PrediXcan, with the latter representing the foundational method. PrediXcan posits the trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue, employing the univariate model outlined in Equation 1 of the original text:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

Here, $\mathbf{t}_l$ denotes the gene's predicted expression in tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ signifies the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ represents the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of this association is gauged through the computation of the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for each gene-tissue model $l$.

Unlike PrediXcan, which necessitates individual-level data to calibrate its model, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics. This is achieved with the following expression (Equation 2 of the original text):

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

In this equation, $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ symbolizes the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ denotes the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ represents the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.

The genotype variances and covariances featured in these Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) techniques are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects—that is, whether an increase or decrease in predicted gene expression corresponds to a higher or lower disease risk—we utilized these $z$-scores within our drug repurposing strategy, the details of which are elucidated below.

\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

Here, $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ denotes the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ represents the variance of a gene's predicted expression in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ signifies the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.

In both TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects (such as whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene correlates with increased or decreased disease risk), we utilized these $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy, which is detailed in the following section.

S-PrediXcan serves as the summary version of PrediXcan. The latter models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue, using the univariate model represented by Equation 1 in the original text. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to estimate the effect size or regression coefficient ($\hat{\gamma}_l$) and error terms ($\bm{\epsilon}_l$). The significance of the association is evaluated by computing the $z$-score ($\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$) for a gene's tissue model ($l$).

In contrast, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics. This is achieved through the expression presented in Equation 2 of the original text. Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ denotes the variance of SNP ($a$), $\hat{\sigma}_l$ represents the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue ($l$), and $\hat{\beta}_a$ signifies the estimated effect size of SNP ($a$) from the GWAS.

Across both TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated utilizing the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects, such as whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene is associated with increased or decreased disease risk. Consequently, we utilized these $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy, which will be detailed in the subsequent section.

Changes made:
1. Replaced ""the summary version"" with ""serves as the summary version"" for clarity.
2. Added ""The latter"" to distinguish PrediXcan from S-PrediXcan.
3. Expanded on Equation 1 and provided a clearer definition of its variables.
4. Reiterated that S-PrediXcan uses GWAS summary statistics for clarity.
5. Specified the role of GTEx v8 as a reference panel.
6. Reworded the final sentence for better flow and readability.

S-PrediXcan serves as the summary version of PrediXcan, as detailed in [doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1]. PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue using the univariate model represented by Equation 1 in the original manuscript, where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ signifies the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, while S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics as shown in Equation 2 of the original manuscript. In this equation, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ denotes the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ represents the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ signifies the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.

The genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel in both TWAS methods. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects, such as whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene is associated with increased or decreased disease risk, we utilized $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach, which will be described in the following section.

S-PrediXcan (""Summary"" PrediXcan) serves as a condensed version of PrediXcan, with both tools leveraged to model a trait as a linear function of gene expression within a single tissue. The PrediXcan model employs the univariate equation:

$$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l},$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ signifies the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. To evaluate association significance, a $z$-score ($\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$) is calculated for each tissue model ($l$).

PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit the model; however, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics. This approximation is formulated as:

$$\hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ denotes the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ signifies the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In both TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as a reference panel.

Considering S-PrediXcan's ability to provide tissue-specific directions of effects (e.g., whether increased or decreased predicted gene expression influences disease risk), we utilized $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy, as detailed below.

S-PrediXcan serves as the summary implementation of PrediXcan, as detailed in [doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1]. PrediXcan employs a linear univariate model to represent the trait as a function of the gene's expression in a single tissue, expressed as:

S-PrediXcan (""Summary PrediXcan"") is a condensed version of PrediXcan, as detailed in [""S-PrediXcan: A method for generating gene-based associations using summary level data from GWAS and eQTL studies"" by Barbeira et al., Nature Communications (2018) doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1]. PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue, employing the univariate model expressed as equation (ef{eq:predixcan}) in the original text. Here, $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ signifies the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. To evaluate the significance of the association, S-PrediXcan calculates the $z$-score ($\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$) based on a gene's tissue model ($l$).

In contrast to PrediXcan, which requires individual-level data to fit its model, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics. This approximation is given by the expression in equation (ef{eq:spredixcan}) of the original text and involves the following variables: $\hat{\sigma}_a$ (the variance of SNP $a$), $\hat{\sigma}_l$ (the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$), and $\hat{\beta}_a$ (the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS). In S-PrediXcan and related TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [""A reference panel for tissue-specific genetic effects across 44 human tissues"" by The GTEx Consortium, Science (2020) doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.

Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects (for example, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene is associated with increased or decreased disease risk), we utilized $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy, which will be explained in the following section.
