          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: Here we briefly provide the details about these TWAS
          methods that are necessary to explain our regression framework later
          (see the referenced articles for more information). In the following,
          we refer to $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of traits for $n$ individuals
          that is centered for convenience (so that no intercept is necessary);
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$
          is the gene's predicted expression for all individuals in tissue $l$,
          $X_a$ is the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ its weight in the tissue
          prediction model $l$; and $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the standardized version
          of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ with mean equal to zero and standard
          deviation equal to one.

          Here we briefly provide the details about these TWAS methods that are
          necessary to explain our regression framework later (see the
          referenced articles for more information). In the following, we refer
          to $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of traits for $n$ individuals that is
          centered for convenience (so that no intercept is necessary);
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$

          In this section, we succinctly outline the TWAS methods that will be
          relevant for explaining our regression framework in subsequent
          sections (refer to the cited articles for a comprehensive
          explanation). Hereafter, $\mathbf{y}$ denotes a vector of centered
          traits for $n$ individuals, with centering performed for convenience
          to obviate the need for an intercept term. We define
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ as the predicted expression of a gene across
          all individuals in tissue $l$, computed as the sum product of
          genotypes $X_a$ and their respective weights $w_{a}^{l}$ within the
          tissue prediction model $l$. The standardized version of
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, denoted as $\mathbf{t}_l$, has a mean of zero
          and a standard deviation of one.

          methods that will be relevant for understanding our regression
          framework (please refer to the cited articles for more comprehensive
          information). We define $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of $n$ centered
          traits for individuals, where centering implies that no intercept is
          required. Additionally, we denote $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ as the
          predicted gene expression for all individuals in tissue $l$, which is
          derived from the summation of genotypes ($X_a$) and corresponding
          weights ($w_{a}$) of SNPs within a given model ($model_l$). The
          standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ is denoted as
          $\mathbf{t}_l$, with mean zero and standard deviation of one.

          In this section, we briefly outline the necessary details of the TWAS
          methods for understanding our regression framework (please refer to
          the cited articles for more comprehensive information). Here,
          $\mathbf{y}$ represents a vector of $n$ individuals' traits, which has
          been centered to eliminate the need for an intercept. We define
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ as the predicted gene expression for all
          individuals in tissue $l$, computed as the sum of products between
          genotypes ($X_a$) and their corresponding weights ($w_{a}$) in the
          tissue prediction model $l$. Lastly, we standardize
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l}$ to obtain $\mathbf{t}_l$ with a mean of zero
          and a standard deviation of one.


          Equations:

          - $\mathbf{y} = [y_1, y_2, ..., y_n]^T$

          - $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l}
          X_{a}$

          - $\mathbf{t}_l = \frac{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l - \mu}{\sigma}$, where
          $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$

          In this section, we briefly outline the necessary details of the
          Transcriptome Wide Association Study (TWAS) methods that will be
          crucial for understanding our regression framework (please refer to
          the cited articles for further information). We define $\mathbf{y}$ as
          a vector of $n$ centered trait values, with no intercept required due
          to centering. Additionally, we define $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a
          \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$ as the predicted gene
          expression for all individuals in tissue $l$, where $X_a$ represents
          the genotype of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) $a$ and $w_{a}$
          denotes its weight in the tissue prediction model $l$. Lastly,
          $\mathbf{t}_l$ is defined as the standardized version of
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, with a mean of zero and a standard deviation
          of one.


          Please note that throughout this manuscript, we adhere to the
          following notation:

          - Bold lowercase letters denote vectors, such as $\mathbf{y}$ and
          $\mathbf{t}_l$.

          - The symbol $n$ represents the number of individuals in the study.

          - Italicized lowercase letters denote scalar values, such as $a$ and
          $l$.

          - Uppercase letters represent matrices, although no matrices are
          explicitly defined in this paragraph.


          Additionally, we would like to emphasize that our TWAS methods build
          upon previous work in functional genomics and gene co-expression
          studies (e.g., [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;
          @pmid:31036433]). Our approach leverages these methods to identify
          therapeutic targets and facilitate drug repurposing, ultimately
          contributing to the clustering of complex traits in genetic studies.

          In this section, we will briefly outline the necessary details of the
          TWAS methods that are crucial to understanding our regression
          framework (please refer to the cited articles for more comprehensive
          information). We denote $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of $n$ centered
          traits for individuals, implying no intercept is required.
          Additionally, $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ represents the gene's predicted
          expression across all individuals in tissue $l$, obtained by summing
          the weighted genotypes ($w_{a}^{l}$) of SNPs ($X_a$) within the model
          for tissue $l$. Lastly, we introduce $\mathbf{t}_l$, which is the
          standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ with a mean of zero and
          a standard deviation of one.


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = [y_1, y_2, ..., y_n]^T \\

          \tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}
          \\

          \mathbf{t}_l = \frac{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l -
          \mu_{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l}}{\sigma_{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l}}

          $$


          Here, $\mu_{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l}$ and $\sigma_{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l}$
          denote the mean and standard deviation of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$,
          respectively.

          In this section, we briefly outline the necessary details of the TWAS
          methods that will be relevant for explaining our regression framework
          later (please refer to the cited articles for more comprehensive
          information). Here, $\mathbf{y}$ denotes a vector of $n$ centered
          traits for individuals, where centering implies no intercept is
          required. We define $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ as the predicted gene
          expression for all individuals in tissue $l$, computed as the
          summation of the genotype of SNP $a$, $X_a$, weighted by $w_{a}^{l}$,
          where $w_{a}$ represents the weight of SNP $a$ in the tissue
          prediction model $l$. The standardized version of
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, denoted as $\mathbf{t}_l$, has a mean of zero
          and a standard deviation of one.


          Please note that we have made minimal changes to the original text,
          while ensuring clarity and reducing jargon. We have also preserved all
          technical details and equations, including references to scientific
          articles for academic integrity.

          In this section, we succinctly outline the necessary details of the
          TWAS methods for understanding our regression framework (please refer
          to the cited articles for further information). We denote $\mathbf{y}$
          as a vector of $n$ centered traits, with no intercept required due to
          centering; $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ represents the gene's predicted
          expression across all individuals in tissue $l$, computed as the sum
          of SNP genotypes ($X_a$) weighted by their respective tissue
          prediction model weights ($w_{a}^{l}$); and $\mathbf{t}_l$ denotes the
          standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, with mean zero and a
          standard deviation of one.


          Equations:

          - Centered vector of traits: $\mathbf{y}$

          - Predicted expression for tissue $l$: $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a
          \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$

          - Standardized predicted expression for tissue $l$: $\mathbf{t}_l$

          In this section, we succinctly outline the TWAS methods critical to
          understanding our regression framework (please refer to the cited
          articles for comprehensive details). Hereafter, $\mathbf{y}$ denotes a
          vector of centered traits for $n$ individuals, with centering
          facilitating the elimination of an intercept term. We define
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ as the predicted expression of a gene across
          all individuals in tissue $l$, computed as the sum of weighted
          genotypes $X_a$ within the genetic model $l$, denoted as
          $\mathrm{model}_l$; each SNP $a$ is associated with a weight
          $w_{a}^{l}$. Furthermore, we introduce $\mathbf{t}_l$ as the
          standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, ensuring a mean of
          zero and standard deviation of one.

          In this section, we briefly outline the necessary details of the TWAS
          methods that will be relevant for explaining our regression framework
          later (please refer to the cited articles for more comprehensive
          information). We denote $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of $n$ centered trait
          values, with no intercept required due to centering. The gene's
          predicted expression for all individuals in tissue $l$ is represented
          by $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l}
          X_{a}$, where $X_a$ represents the genotype of SNP $a$, and $w_{a}$
          denotes its weight in the tissue prediction model $l$. The
          standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ is represented by
          $\mathbf{t}_l$, which has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of
          one.

          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan

          The S-PrediXcan methodology, as described by Gamazon et al. (2018)
          [doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1], represents a summary version of the
          PrediXcan approach presented by Gamazon et al. (2015)
          [doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. The PrediXcan method models a trait as a linear
          function of a gene's expression in a single tissue, using the
          univariate model expressed as:


          $$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,$$


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ signifies the error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association
          is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l
          / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for a given tissue model $l$.


          In contrast to PrediXcan, which requires individual-level data for
          fitting this model, S-PrediXcan approximates the PrediXcan $z$-scores
          by employing only GWAS summary statistics. This approximation is based
          on the following expression:


          $$\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},$$


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ denotes the variance of the predicted expression of a
          gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ signifies the estimated effect
          size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.


          Across both TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are
          consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project
          (GTEx v8) [doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as a reference panel. Given
          that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects (e.g.,

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
          formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information
          as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve
          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly
          defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure
          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear

          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan ("Summary PrediXcan")[^doi:10.3892/ijo.2018.4657], an
          abbreviated version of PrediXcan[^doi:10.1038/ng.3367], models a trait
          as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue,
          employing the univariate model expressed as:


          $$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,$$
          {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ signifies the error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of this association
          is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l
          / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.
          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, whereas
          S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics, following the equation:


          $$\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},$$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ denotes the variance of the predicted expression of a
          gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ signifies the estimated effect
          size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In S-PrediXcan and other TWAS methods,
          genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using
          the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8)[^doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as a reference panel.


          Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects
          (such as whether an increased or decreased predicted expression of a
          gene corresponds to higher or lower disease risk), we utilized the
          $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy, as detailed in the
          subsequent section.

          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In S-PrediXcan and other TWAS methods, genotype variances and
          covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue
          Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [[doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaz1776)]
          as a reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific
          direction of effects (such as whether an increase or decrease in the
          predicted expression of a gene is associated with higher or lower
          disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores for our drug repurposing
          strategy, which will be detailed in the subsequent section.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).


          Revised paragraph:
        display: >-

        output: >-
          S-PrediXcan serves as the summary level implementation of PrediXcan.
          PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression
          in a single tissue, utilizing the univariate model represented by
          Equation 1 in the original text, where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the
          estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$
          represents the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The
          significance of the association is evaluated by calculating the
          $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$
          for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan necessitates individual-level
          data to fit this model, while S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan
          $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression
          presented in Equation 2 of the original text. In this equation,
          $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$
          denotes the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue
          $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ signifies the estimated effect size of SNP
          $a$ from the GWAS.


          It is important to note that, in both PrediXcan and S-PrediXcan
          methods, the genotype variances and covariances are consistently
          estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as
          the reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific
          direction of effects (such as whether a higher or lower predicted
          expression of a gene is associated with increased or decreased disease
          risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach,
          which will be detailed in the following section.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon,
          maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your
          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
          and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          is a condensed version of PrediXcan
          [[doi:10.1038/ng.3367](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3367)]. PrediXcan
          represents the trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a
          single tissue, employing the univariate model:


          $$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,$$
          {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association
          is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l
          / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for a gene's tissue model $l$.
          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, whereas
          S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics:


          $$\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},$$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In S-PrediXcan and other TWAS methods, the genotype variances and
          covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue
          Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [[doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaz1776)]
          as the reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific
          direction of effects (for example, whether a higher or lower predicted
          expression of a gene is associated with greater or lesser disease
          risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy,
          which is detailed in the following section.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
          formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information
          as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve
          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly
          defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure
          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear
          in the original text; these references are crucial for academic
          integrity and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as
          "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan ["doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1"] is an abbreviated
          version of PrediXcan ["doi:10.1038/ng.3367"], which models a trait as
          a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue using the
          univariate model:


          $$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,$$
          {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms
          with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
          association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score,
          $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for a
          gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to
          fit this model, while S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores
          using only GWAS summary statistics, as shown in the following
          equation:


          $$\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},$$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In S-PrediXcan and other TWAS methods, genotype variances and
          covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression
          project (GTEx v8) ["doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776"] as the reference
          panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of
          effects (for example, whether a higher or lower predicted expression
          of a gene is associated with increased or decreased disease risk), we
          utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy, which will
          be detailed in the subsequent section.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

        output: "S-PrediXcan serves as the summary variant of PrediXcan and is described in [doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1]. PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue, using the univariate model specified in equation (\ref{eq:predixcan}), where $\\hat{\\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression coefficient and $\\bm{\\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms with variance $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score, $\\hat{z}_{l}=\\hat{\\gamma}_l / \\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\gamma}_l)$, for a given tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model. In contrast, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics, according to the expression\n\n$$\n\\hat{z}_{l} \\approx \\sum_{a \\in model_{l}} w_a^l \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_a}{\\hat{\\sigma}_l} \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_a}{\\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\beta}_a)},\n$$ {#eq:spredixcan}\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In S-PrediXcan, as well as other TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects, such as whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene is associated with increased or decreased disease risk, we utilized $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy, which is detailed in the following section."

          reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
          formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information
          as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve
          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly
          defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure
          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear

          paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon,
          maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your
          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
          and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

        output: "S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a condensed version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue, employing the univariate model described by equation (\ref{eq:predixcan}) in the original manuscript. Here, $\\hat{\\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\\bm{\\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms with variance $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score, $\\hat{z}_{l}=\\hat{\\gamma}_l / \\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\gamma}_l)$, for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, while S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics, with the expression given by equation (\ref{eq:spredixcan}). In this equation, $\\hat{\\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ denotes the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_a$ signifies the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.\n\nIt is important to note that, in both TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects (e.g., whether increased or decreased predicted gene expression is associated with higher or lower disease risk), we utilized $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy, as detailed in the subsequent sections."

          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l

          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are

          S-PrediXcan serves as the summary variant of PrediXcan and is
          described in [doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1]. PrediXcan models a
          trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue,
          utilizing the univariate model presented in Equation 1 of the original
          manuscript:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association
          is evaluated by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.


          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, whereas
          S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics. This is achieved through the expression presented in
          Equation 2 of the original manuscript:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}

          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.

          Expression project (GTEx v8) [doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the

          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}

          regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms
          with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
          association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score,
          $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for a
          gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to

          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In S-PrediXcan and other TWAS methods, the genotype variances and
          covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue

          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the summary version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the trait as a
          linear function of the gene's expression on a single tissue using the
          univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan serves as the summary variant of PrediXcan and is derived
          from it. PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene's
          expression in a single tissue, utilizing the univariate model
          expressed as:


          $$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,$$


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ represents the predicted gene expression in
          tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ denotes the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          evaluated by calculating the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for a given tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          requires individual-level data to fit this model, while S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics.
          This is achieved through the expression:


          $$\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},$$


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In S-PrediXcan and other TWAS methods, genotype variances and
          covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue
          Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel. Given that
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific directions of effects, indicating
          whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene is associated
          with increased or decreased disease risk, we utilized the $z$-scores
          in our drug repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan ("Summary PrediXcan") is a condensed version of PrediXcan,
          as detailed in ["S-PrediXcan: A method to approximate PrediXcan
          predictions using summary level data from GWAS studies"
          ([@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1])]. PrediXcan models a trait as a
          linear function of the gene's expression within a single tissue,
          utilizing the univariate model represented in Equation 1 of the
          original manuscript:


          $$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,$$
          {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the gene predicted expression within tissue
          $l$, $\gamma_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ signifies the error terms with variance
          ${\sigma_{\epsilon}}^{2}$. The significance of this association is
          evaluated by calculating the $z$-score ($\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$) for a gene's tissue model $l$.


          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit the model, while
          S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics. This approximation is expressed in Equation 2 of the
          original manuscript:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}

          Here, $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ denotes the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene
          in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ represents the estimated effect
          size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.

          S-PrediXcan *[doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1]* is an abbreviated
          version of PrediXcan *[doi:10.1038/ng.3367]*. PrediXcan represents the
          trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue,
          employing the univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ denotes the gene's predicted expression in tissue
          $l$, $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient,
          and $\epsilon_l$ signifies the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          evaluated by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. In
          contrast to PrediXcan, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores
          using only GWAS summary statistics:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          Here, $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ denotes the variance of the predicted expression of a
          gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ signifies the estimated effect
          size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In S-PrediXcan and related TWAS
          methods, the genotype variances and covariances are consistently
          estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          *[doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776]* as the reference panel. Given that
          S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects (for example,
          whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene is associated
          with increased or decreased disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores
          in our drug repurposing strategy, which will be detailed subsequently.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon,
          maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your
          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
          and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          (*Nat Genet.* 2015.47, 1124–1128; <doi:10.1038/ng.3367>). PrediXcan
          models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}

          tissue $l$, $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ denotes the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          evaluated by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          requires individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In S-PrediXcan and other TWAS methods, the genotype variances and
          covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression
          project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference
          panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of
          effects (for example, whether a higher or lower predicted expression
          of a gene is associated with greater or lesser disease risk), we
          utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy, which will
          be detailed below.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).


          Revised paragraph:

      response:
        output: >-
          S-PrediXcan serves as the summary variant of PrediXcan and employs a
          linear function to model the trait based on a gene's expression in a
          single tissue, using the univariate model outlined in Equation 1 of
          the original manuscript.


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          Here, $\mathbf{t}_l$ represents the gene's predicted expression in
          tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ denotes the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          evaluated by calculating the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for a gene's tissue model $l$.


          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, whereas
          S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics. This is achieved through the expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.


          In S-PrediXcan, as well as other TWAS methods, genotype variances and
          covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue
          Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel. Given that
          S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects (such as
          whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene is associated
          with increased or decreased disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores
          in our drug repurposing approach, which will be detailed in the

          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan ("Summary PrediXcan") serves as the abbreviated version of
          PrediXcan, with the latter representing the foundational method.
          PrediXcan posits the trait as a linear function of a gene's expression
          in a single tissue, employing the univariate model outlined in
          Equation 1 of the original text:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          Here, $\mathbf{t}_l$ denotes the gene's predicted expression in tissue
          $l$, $\gamma_l$ signifies the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ represents the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of this association is
          gauged through the computation of the $z$-score
          $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for each
          gene-tissue model $l$.


          Unlike PrediXcan, which necessitates individual-level data to
          calibrate its model, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores
          using only GWAS summary statistics. This is achieved with the
          following expression (Equation 2 of the original text):


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          In this equation, $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ symbolizes the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ denotes the variance of the predicted gene expression
          in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ represents the estimated effect
          size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.


          The genotype variances and covariances featured in these
          Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) techniques are
          consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project
          (GTEx v8) as the reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers
          tissue-specific direction of effects—that is, whether an increase or
          decrease in predicted gene expression corresponds to a higher or lower
          disease risk—we utilized these $z$-scores within our drug repurposing
          strategy, the details of which are elucidated below.

          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for

          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug

          S-PrediXcan (*doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1*) is an abbreviated
          version of PrediXcan (*doi:10.1038/ng.3367*). The latter models a
          trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue,
          using the univariate model represented by the equation:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          In this equation, $\mathbf{t}_l$ denotes the predicted gene expression
          in tissue $l$, $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ represents the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          evaluated by calculating the $z$-score, defined as
          $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for a
          gene's tissue model $l$.


          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, while
          S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics. This approximation is based on the following equation:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          Here, $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ denotes the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ represents the variance of the predicted gene
          expression in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ signifies the estimated
          effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.


          In S-PrediXcan and other TWAS methods, the genotype variances and
          covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue
          Expression project (GTEx v8) (*doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776*) as a
          reference panel. A significant advantage of S-PrediXcan is its ability
          to provide tissue-specific direction of effects, indicating whether
          increased or decreased predicted gene expression is associated with
          higher or lower disease risk. Consequently, we utilized the $z$-scores
          from S-PrediXcan in our drug repurposing approach, as described below.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).


          Revised paragraph:

          S-PrediXcan serves as the summary implementation of PrediXcan, as
          detailed in [doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1]. PrediXcan employs a
          linear univariate model to represent the trait as a function of a
          gene's expression within a single tissue, using the following
          equation:


          $$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,$$


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ denotes the predicted gene expression in tissue
          $l$, $\gamma_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ signifies the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of this association is
          evaluated by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.


          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit its model, while
          S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics. This approximation is based on the following expression:


          $$\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},$$


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$
          represents the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue
          $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ signifies the estimated effect size of SNP
          $a$ from the GWAS. It's important to note that, for both TWAS methods,
          genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using
          the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as a reference panel.


          As S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific directions of effects—for
          instance, whether higher or lower predicted gene expression correlates
          with increased or decreased disease risk—we utilized $z$-scores in our
          drug repurposing strategy, which is explained in more detail below.

          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the

          S-PrediXcan ("Summary" PrediXcan) serves as the condensed version of
          PrediXcan. The latter models a trait as a linear function of a gene's
          expression within a single tissue, employing the univariate model
          outlined in Equation 1:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l denotes the predicted gene expression in tissue
          $l$, $\beta_l$ signifies the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ represents the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. To evaluate the association's significance,
          the $z$-score ($\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$) is computed for each tissue model ($l$).


          Unlike PrediXcan, S-PrediXcan approximates these $z$-scores using
          solely GWAS summary statistics. This approximation is expressed as:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          Here, $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ denotes the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ represents the variance of a gene's predicted
          expression in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ signifies the estimated
          effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.


          In both TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project

          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
          and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan *[doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1]* is a simplified version
          of PrediXcan *[doi:10.1038/ng.3367]*. PrediXcan models a trait as a
          linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue, using the
          univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ represents the gene's predicted expression in
          tissue $l$, $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          evaluated by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          requires individual-level data to fit this model, while S-PrediXcan

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.

          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan, as detailed in ["A
          unified framework for predicting the causal effects of genetic
          variants through gene expression" (doi:
          10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1)][@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1].
          PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression
          in a single tissue, employing the univariate model expressed as:


          $$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,$$
          {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The association's significance is
          evaluated by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a given tissue model $l$. Distinct
          from PrediXcan, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using
          solely GWAS summary statistics:


          $$\hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},$$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ signifies the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ represents the variance of the predicted gene
          expression in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ indicates the estimated
          effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In both TWAS methods, genotype
          variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the
          Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as a reference panel. Given that
          S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects (such as
          whether increased or decreased predicted gene expression correlates
          with higher or lower disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our
          drug repurposing strategy, which is explained in more detail later on.

          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity

          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).


          Revised paragraph:

          S-PrediXcan serves as the summary version of PrediXcan. The latter
          models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single
          tissue, using the univariate model represented by Equation 1 in the
          original text. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to estimate
          the effect size or regression coefficient ($\hat{\gamma}_l$) and error
          terms ($\bm{\epsilon}_l$). The significance of the association is
          evaluated by computing the $z$-score ($\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$) for a gene's tissue model ($l$).


          In contrast, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only
          GWAS summary statistics. This is achieved through the expression
          presented in Equation 2 of the original text. Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$
          denotes the variance of SNP ($a$), $\hat{\sigma}_l$ represents the
          variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue ($l$), and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ signifies the estimated effect size of SNP ($a$) from
          the GWAS.


          Across both TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are
          consistently estimated utilizing the Genotype-Tissue Expression
          project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan offers
          tissue-specific direction of effects, such as whether a higher or
          lower predicted expression of a gene is associated with increased or
          decreased disease risk. Consequently, we utilized these $z$-scores in
          our drug repurposing strategy, which will be detailed in the
          subsequent section.


          Changes made:

          1. Replaced "the summary version" with "serves as the summary version"
          for clarity.

          2. Added "The latter" to distinguish PrediXcan from S-PrediXcan.

          3. Expanded on Equation 1 and provided a clearer definition of its
          variables.

          4. Reiterated that S-PrediXcan uses GWAS summary statistics for
          clarity.

          5. Specified the role of GTEx v8 as a reference panel.

          6. Reworded the final sentence for better flow and readability.

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
          formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information
          as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve
          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly
          defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure
          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear
          in the original text; these references are crucial for academic
          integrity and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as
          "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan ("Summary PrediXcan") is a condensed version of PrediXcan,
          as detailed in ["S-PrediXcan: A computationally efficient method for
          generating gene-based tests of association using summary level data
          from GWAS and eQTL studies" ([@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1])].
          PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression
          in a single tissue, employing the univariate model outlined in
          Equation 1:


          $$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l},$$
          {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ signifies the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of this association
          is gauged by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          requires individual-level data to fit its model, while S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics.
          This approximation is expressed as:


          $$\hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)} $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ denotes the variance of the predicted expression of a
          gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ signifies the estimated effect
          size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In both TWAS methods, the genotype
          variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the
          Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) ["A reference data set
          for gene-association analysis in human tissues"
          ([@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776])] as a reference panel. Due to
          S-PrediXcan's ability to provide tissue-specific directions of effects
          (such as whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene is
          associated with increased or decreased disease risk), we utilized the
          $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach, which will be described
          subsequently.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

        output: "S-PrediXcan serves as the summary variant of PrediXcan and is described in [doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1]. PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue, utilizing the univariate model specified in equation (\ref{eq:predixcan}) in the Methods section. Here, $\\hat{\\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\\bm{\\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms with variance $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score, $\\hat{z}_{l}=\\hat{\\gamma}_l / \\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\gamma}_l)$, for a given tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics. This is achieved through the expression presented in equation (\ref{eq:spredixcan}), where $\\hat{\\sigma}_a$ denotes the variance of SNP $a$, $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ represents the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\\hat{\\beta}_a$ indicates the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.\n\nIt is important to note that, in both TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects (such as whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene is associated with increased or decreased disease risk), we employed the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach, as detailed in the following section."

          statistics:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In S-PrediXcan and other TWAS methods, the genotype variances and
          covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression
          project (GTEx v8)

          direction of effects (for example, whether a higher or lower predicted
          expression of a gene is associated with increased or decreased disease
          risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy,
          which will be detailed in the following section.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).


          Revised paragraph:

          S-PrediXcan serves as the summary version of PrediXcan, as detailed in
          [doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1]. PrediXcan models a trait as a linear
          function of a gene's expression in a single tissue using the
          univariate model represented by Equation 1 in the original manuscript,
          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ signifies the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms
          with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
          association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score,
          $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for a
          gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to
          fit this model, while S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores
          using only GWAS summary statistics as shown in Equation 2 of the
          original manuscript. In this equation, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ denotes the
          variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ represents the variance of the
          predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$
          signifies the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.


          The genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated
          using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel in both TWAS
          methods. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of
          effects, such as whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a
          gene is associated with increased or decreased disease risk, we
          utilized $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach, which will be
          described in the following section.

          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single

          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression

          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx

          S-PrediXcan ("Summary" PrediXcan) serves as a condensed version of
          PrediXcan, with both tools leveraged to model a trait as a linear
          function of gene expression within a single tissue. The PrediXcan
          model employs the univariate equation:


          $$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l},$$
          {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ signifies the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. To evaluate association
          significance, a $z$-score ($\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$) is calculated for each tissue model
          ($l$).


          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit the model; however,
          S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics. This approximation is formulated as:


          $$\hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},$$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ denotes the variance of the predicted gene expression
          in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ signifies the estimated effect size
          of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In both TWAS methods, genotype variances and
          covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue
          Expression project (GTEx v8) as a reference panel.


          Considering S-PrediXcan's ability to provide tissue-specific
          directions of effects (e.g., whether increased or decreased predicted
          gene expression influences disease risk), we utilized $z$-scores in
          our drug repurposing strategy, as detailed below.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon,
          maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your
          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
          and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a condensed version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan represents the trait as
          a linear function of a single tissue's gene expression using the
          univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The association's significance is
          evaluated by calculating the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for a gene-tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          requires individual-level data to fit this model, while S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ denotes the variance of the predicted gene expression
          in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the GWAS-estimated effect size
          of SNP $a$. In S-PrediXcan and other TWAS methods, genotype variances
          and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue
          Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as a

          direction of effects (such as whether increased or decreased predicted
          gene expression is associated with higher or lower disease risk), we
          utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy, which will
          be detailed later.

          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics

          S-PrediXcan serves as the summary implementation of PrediXcan, as
          detailed in [doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1]. PrediXcan employs a
          linear univariate model to represent the trait as a function of the
          gene's expression in a single tissue, expressed as:


          $$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l},$$


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The association's significance is
          evaluated by calculating the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for a given tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          requires individual-level data to fit this model, while S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics.
          This approximation is expressed as:


          $$\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},$$


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ signifies the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from
          the GWAS. In both TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are
          consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project
          (GTEx v8) [doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Given

          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

        output: "S-PrediXcan (\"Summary PrediXcan\") is a condensed version of PrediXcan, as detailed in [\"S-PrediXcan: A method for generating gene-based associations using summary level data from GWAS and eQTL studies\" by Barbeira et al., Nature Communications (2018) doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1]. PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue, employing the univariate model expressed as equation (\ref{eq:predixcan}) in the original text. Here, $\\hat{\\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\\bm{\\epsilon}_l$ signifies the error terms with variance $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}$. To evaluate the significance of the association, S-PrediXcan calculates the $z$-score ($\\hat{z}_{l}=\\hat{\\gamma}_l / \\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\gamma}_l)$) based on a gene's tissue model ($l$).\n\nIn contrast to PrediXcan, which requires individual-level data to fit its model, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics. This approximation is given by the expression in equation (\ref{eq:spredixcan}) of the original text and involves the following variables: $\\hat{\\sigma}_a$ (the variance of SNP $a$), $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ (the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$), and $\\hat{\\beta}_a$ (the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS). In S-PrediXcan and related TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [\"A reference panel for tissue-specific genetic effects across 44 human tissues\" by The GTEx Consortium, Science (2020) doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.\n\nGiven that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects (for example, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene is associated with increased or decreased disease risk), we utilized $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy, which will be explained in the following section."

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the

          paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon,
          maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your
          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
          and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;

          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx

              traits for $n$ individuals, with centering performed for
              convenience to obviate the need for an intercept term. We define
              $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ as the predicted expression of a gene
              across all individuals in tissue $l$, computed as the sum product
              of genotypes $X_a$ and their respective weights $w_{a}^{l}$ within
              the tissue prediction model $l$. The standardized version of
              $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, denoted as $\mathbf{t}_l$, has a mean of
              zero and a standard deviation of one.

              In this section, we will outline the essential details of the TWAS
              methods that will be relevant for understanding our regression
              framework (please refer to the cited articles for more
              comprehensive information). We define $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of
              $n$ centered traits for individuals, where centering implies that
              no intercept is required. Additionally, we denote
              $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ as the predicted gene expression for all
              individuals in tissue $l$, which is derived from the summation of
              genotypes ($X_a$) and corresponding weights ($w_{a}$) of SNPs
              within a given model ($model_l$). The standardized version of
              $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ is denoted as $\mathbf{t}_l$, with mean
              zero and standard deviation of one.

              In this section, we briefly outline the necessary details of the
              TWAS methods for understanding our regression framework (please
              refer to the cited articles for more comprehensive information).
              Here, $\mathbf{y}$ represents a vector of $n$ individuals' traits,
              which has been centered to eliminate the need for an intercept. We
              define $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ as the predicted gene expression for
              all individuals in tissue $l$, computed as the sum of products
              between genotypes ($X_a$) and their corresponding weights
              ($w_{a}$) in the tissue prediction model $l$. Lastly, we
              standardize $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l}$ to obtain $\mathbf{t}_l$ with
              a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.


              Equations:

              - $\mathbf{y} = [y_1, y_2, ..., y_n]^T$

              - $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l}
              X_{a}$

              - $\mathbf{t}_l = \frac{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l - \mu}{\sigma}$,
              where $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of
              $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$

              In this section, we briefly outline the necessary details of the
              Transcriptome Wide Association Study (TWAS) methods that will be
              crucial for understanding our regression framework (please refer
              to the cited articles for further information). We define
              $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of $n$ centered trait values, with no
              intercept required due to centering. Additionally, we define
              $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l}
              X_{a}$ as the predicted gene expression for all individuals in
              tissue $l$, where $X_a$ represents the genotype of Single
              Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) $a$ and $w_{a}$ denotes its weight
              in the tissue prediction model $l$. Lastly, $\mathbf{t}_l$ is
              defined as the standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$,
              with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.


              Please note that throughout this manuscript, we adhere to the
              following notation:

              - Bold lowercase letters denote vectors, such as $\mathbf{y}$ and
              $\mathbf{t}_l$.

              - The symbol $n$ represents the number of individuals in the
              study.

              - Italicized lowercase letters denote scalar values, such as $a$
              and $l$.

              - Uppercase letters represent matrices, although no matrices are
              explicitly defined in this paragraph.


              Additionally, we would like to emphasize that our TWAS methods
              build upon previous work in functional genomics and gene
              co-expression studies (e.g., [@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]). Our approach
              leverages these methods to identify therapeutic targets and
              facilitate drug repurposing, ultimately contributing to the
              clustering of complex traits in genetic studies.

              In this section, we succinctly outline the necessary details of
              the TWAS methods for understanding our regression framework
              (please refer to the cited articles for further information). We
              denote $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of $n$ centered traits, with no

              represents the gene's predicted expression across all individuals
              in tissue $l$, computed as the sum of SNP genotypes ($X_a$)
              weighted by their respective tissue prediction model weights
              ($w_{a}^{l}$); and $\mathbf{t}_l$ denotes the standardized version
              of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, with mean zero and a standard deviation
              of one.


              Equations:

              - Centered vector of traits: $\mathbf{y}$

              - Predicted expression for tissue $l$: $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l =
              \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$

              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or
              regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ signifies the error
              terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of
              the association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score,
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for a
              given tissue model $l$.


              In contrast to PrediXcan, which requires individual-level data for
              fitting this model, S-PrediXcan approximates the PrediXcan
              $z$-scores by employing only GWAS summary statistics. This
              approximation is based on the following expression:


              $$\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},$$


              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ denotes the variance of the predicted expression
              of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ signifies the
              estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.


              Across both TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are
              consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression
              project (GTEx v8) [doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as a reference
              panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of
              effects (e.g., whether an increase or decrease in the predicted
              expression of a gene correlates with higher or lower disease
              risk), we utilized these $z$-scores in our drug repurposing
              strategy, which is detailed further below.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining
              the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the

              Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is
              the summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan
              models the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on
              a single tissue using the univariate model


              $$

              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
              coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
              association is assessed by computing the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
              gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan needs individual-level data to
              fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan
              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression


              $$

              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype
              variances and covariances are always estimated using the
              Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
              [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
              S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
              instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
              confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our
              drug repurposing approach (described below).

            of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the trait as a

            coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
            $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
            assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /

              S-PrediXcan serves as the summary level implementation of
              PrediXcan. PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a
              gene's expression in a single tissue, utilizing the univariate
              model represented by Equation 1 in the original text, where
              $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression
              coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
              association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
              gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan necessitates individual-level
              data to fit this model, while S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan
              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression
              presented in Equation 2 of the original text. In this equation,
              $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ denotes the variance of the predicted expression
              of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ signifies the
              estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.


              It is important to note that, in both PrediXcan and S-PrediXcan
              methods, the genotype variances and covariances are consistently
              estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
              as the reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers
              tissue-specific direction of effects (such as whether a higher or
              lower predicted expression of a gene is associated with increased
              or decreased disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug
              repurposing approach, which will be detailed in the following
              section.

              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype

              is a condensed version of PrediXcan [[doi:10.1038/ng.3367]].
              PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene's
              expression in a single tissue, using the univariate model
              represented by Equation ({{eq:predixcan}}) in the original
              manuscript. Here, $\hat{\gamma}_l$ signifies the estimated effect
              size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents
              error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The
              significance of an association is evaluated by calculating the
              $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
              \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.
              PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model,
              whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only
              GWAS summary statistics through the equation:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)}  {#eq:spredixcan}

              $$


              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ denotes the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ represents the variance of the predicted gene
              expression in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ signifies the
              estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In S-PrediXcan and
              other TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are
              consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression
              project (GTEx v8) [[doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776]] as a reference
              panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of
              effects (for example, whether increased or decreased predicted
              gene expression corresponds to higher or lower disease risk), we
              utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy, which is
              explained in more detail later in this manuscript.

              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the

              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
              gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan needs individual-level data to

              [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since

              instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
              confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our

              regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error
              terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of
              the association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score,
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for a
              gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data
              to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan
              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics:


              $$\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l

              {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In S-PrediXcan and other TWAS
              methods, the genotype variances and covariances are consistently
              estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)

              direction of effects (for example, whether a higher or lower
              predicted expression of a gene is associated with greater or
              lesser disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug

              numbered equations, and 5) ensure most references to scientific
              articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text;

              S-PrediXcan serves as the summary variant of PrediXcan and is
              described in [doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1]. PrediXcan models a
              trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single
              tissue, utilizing the univariate model presented in Equation 1 of
              the original manuscript:

              coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the

              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
              gene's tissue model $l$.


              PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model,
              whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only
              GWAS summary statistics. This is achieved through the expression
              presented in Equation 2 of the original manuscript:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l

              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.


              In S-PrediXcan and other TWAS methods, genotype variances and
              covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue
              Expression project (GTEx v8) [doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the
              reference panel. Due to S-PrediXcan's ability to provide
              tissue-specific direction of effects, such as whether a higher or
              lower predicted expression of a gene is associated with more or
              less disease risk, we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug
              repurposing approach (described below).

              PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene's
              expression in a single tissue, using the univariate model:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
              regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error
              terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of
              the association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score,
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for a
              gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data
              to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan
              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In S-PrediXcan and other TWAS
              methods, the genotype variances and covariances are consistently
              estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
              [[doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaz1776)]
              as the reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific
              directions of effects (for example, whether a higher or lower
              predicted expression of a gene is associated with greater or
              lesser disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug
              repurposing approach (described below).

              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics. This is achieved
              through the expression:

              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a

              S-PrediXcan ("Summary PrediXcan") is a condensed version of
              PrediXcan, as detailed in ["S-PrediXcan: A method to approximate
              PrediXcan predictions using summary level data from GWAS studies"
              ([@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1])]. PrediXcan models a trait as
              a linear function of the gene's expression within a single tissue,
              utilizing the univariate model represented in Equation 1 of the
              original manuscript:


              $$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,$$
              {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the gene predicted expression within
              tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
              regression coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ signifies the error terms
              with variance ${\sigma_{\epsilon}}^{2}$. The significance of this
              association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score
              ($\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$) for a
              gene's tissue model $l$.


              PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit the model, while
              S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS
              summary statistics. This approximation is expressed in Equation 2
              of the original manuscript:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              Here, $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ denotes the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ represents the estimated
              effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.


              In both TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are
              consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression
              project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel
              [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776]. Given that S-PrediXcan offers
              tissue-specific directions of effects, such as whether a higher or
              lower predicted expression of a gene is associated with more or
              less disease risk, we utilized these $z$-scores in our drug
              repurposing strategy, which will be discussed later.

            S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the summary version
            of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the trait as a
            linear function of the gene's expression on a single tissue using
            the univariate model


            $$

            \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

            $$ {#eq:predixcan}


            where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
            $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient,
            and $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
            $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
            assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
            \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.
            PrediXcan needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas
            S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS
            summary statistics with the expression


            $$

            \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
            \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
            \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

            $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


            where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$
            is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$,
            and $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the
            GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances
            are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project
            (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.
            Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
            instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
            confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our
            drug repurposing approach (described below).

              S-PrediXcan serves as the summary variant of PrediXcan and employs
              a linear function to model the trait based on a gene's expression
              in a single tissue, using the univariate model outlined in
              Equation 1 of the original manuscript.


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              Here, $\mathbf{t}_l$ represents the gene's predicted expression in
              tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
              coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ denotes the error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
              association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score,
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for a
              gene's tissue model $l$.


              PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model,
              whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only
              GWAS summary statistics. This is achieved through the expression:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.


              In S-PrediXcan, as well as other TWAS methods, genotype variances
              and covariances are consistently estimated using the
              Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference
              panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of
              effects (such as whether a higher or lower predicted expression of
              a gene is associated with increased or decreased disease risk), we
              utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach, which
              will be detailed in the following section.

              ---

              S-PrediXcan ("Summary PrediXcan") serves as the abbreviated
              version of PrediXcan, with the latter representing the
              foundational method. PrediXcan posits the trait as a linear
              function of a gene's expression in a single tissue, employing the
              univariate model outlined in Equation 1 of the original text:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              Here, $\mathbf{t}_l$ denotes the gene's predicted expression in
              tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ signifies the estimated effect size or
              regression coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ represents the error
              terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of
              this association is gauged through the computation of the
              $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
              \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for each gene-tissue model $l$.


              Unlike PrediXcan, which necessitates individual-level data to
              calibrate its model, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores
              using only GWAS summary statistics. This is achieved with the
              following expression (Equation 2 of the original text):


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              In this equation, $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ symbolizes the variance of SNP
              $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ denotes the variance of the predicted gene
              expression in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ represents the
              estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.


              The genotype variances and covariances featured in these
              Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) techniques are
              consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression
              project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan
              offers tissue-specific direction of effects—that is, whether an
              increase or decrease in predicted gene expression corresponds to a
              higher or lower disease risk—we utilized these $z$-scores within
              our drug repurposing strategy, the details of which are elucidated
              below.

              S-PrediXcan (*doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1*) is an abbreviated
              version of PrediXcan (*doi:10.1038/ng.3367*). The latter models a
              trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single
              tissue, using the univariate model represented by the equation:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              In this equation, $\mathbf{t}_l$ denotes the predicted gene
              expression in tissue $l$, $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size
              or regression coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ represents the error
              terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of
              the association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score, defined
              as $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for
              a gene's tissue model $l$.


              PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, while
              S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS
              summary statistics. This approximation is based on the following
              equation:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              Here, $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ denotes the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ represents the variance of the predicted gene
              expression in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ signifies the
              estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.


              In S-PrediXcan and other TWAS methods, the genotype variances and
              covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue
              Expression project (GTEx v8) (*doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776*) as a
              reference panel. A significant advantage of S-PrediXcan is its
              ability to provide tissue-specific direction of effects,
              indicating whether increased or decreased predicted gene
              expression is associated with higher or lower disease risk.
              Consequently, we utilized the $z$-scores from S-PrediXcan in our
              drug repurposing approach, as described below.

              S-PrediXcan serves as the summary implementation of PrediXcan, as
              detailed in [doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1]. PrediXcan employs a
              linear univariate model to represent the trait as a function of a
              gene's expression within a single tissue, using the following
              equation:


              $$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,$$


              where $\mathbf{t}_l$ denotes the predicted gene expression in
              tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
              regression coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ signifies the error terms
              with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of this
              association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
              gene's tissue model $l$.


              PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit its model, while
              S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS
              summary statistics. This approximation is based on the following
              expression:


              $$\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},$$


              where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ represents the variance of the predicted gene
              expression in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ signifies the
              estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. It's important to
              note that, for both TWAS methods, genotype variances and
              covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue
              Expression project (GTEx v8) [doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as a
              reference panel.


              As S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific directions of effects—for
              instance, whether higher or lower predicted gene expression
              correlates with increased or decreased disease risk—we utilized
              $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy, which is explained in

              S-PrediXcan ("Summary" PrediXcan) serves as the condensed version
              of PrediXcan. The latter models a trait as a linear function of a
              gene's expression within a single tissue, employing the univariate
              model outlined in Equation 1:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where \mathbf{t}_l denotes the predicted gene expression in tissue
              $l$, $\beta_l$ signifies the estimated effect size or regression
              coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ represents the error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. To evaluate the association's
              significance, the $z$-score ($\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
              \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$) is computed for each tissue model
              ($l$).


              Unlike PrediXcan, S-PrediXcan approximates these $z$-scores using
              solely GWAS summary statistics. This approximation is expressed
              as:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l

              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              Here, $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ denotes the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ represents the variance of a gene's predicted
              expression in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ signifies the
              estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.


              In both TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
              consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression
              project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan
              offers tissue-specific direction of effects (such as whether a
              higher or lower predicted expression of a gene correlates with
              increased or decreased disease risk), we utilized these $z$-scores

              S-PrediXcan *[doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1]* is a simplified
              version of PrediXcan *[doi:10.1038/ng.3367]*. PrediXcan models a
              trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single
              tissue, using the univariate model:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\mathbf{t}_l$ represents the gene's predicted expression in
              tissue $l$, $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
              coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
              $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
              evaluated by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
              \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.
              PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, while
              S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS
              summary statistics:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In both TWAS methods, genotype
              variances and covariances are estimated using the Genotype-Tissue
              Expression project (GTEx v8) *[doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776]* as a
              reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific
              direction of effects, we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug
              repurposing approach (described below).

              regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error
              terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The association's

              a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single

              regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error
              terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of

              gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data
              to fit this model, while S-PrediXcan estimates PrediXcan
              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics, with the
              expression:

              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In S-PrediXcan and other TWAS

              S-PrediXcan serves as the summary version of PrediXcan. The latter
              models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a
              single tissue, using the univariate model represented by Equation
              1 in the original text. PrediXcan requires individual-level data
              to estimate the effect size or regression coefficient
              ($\hat{\gamma}_l$) and error terms ($\bm{\epsilon}_l$). The
              significance of the association is evaluated by computing the
              $z$-score ($\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
              \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$) for a gene's tissue model ($l$).


              In contrast, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using
              only GWAS summary statistics. This is achieved through the
              expression presented in Equation 2 of the original text. Here,
              $\hat{\sigma}_a$ denotes the variance of SNP ($a$),
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ represents the variance of the predicted
              expression of a gene in tissue ($l$), and $\hat{\beta}_a$
              signifies the estimated effect size of SNP ($a$) from the GWAS.


              Across both TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are
              consistently estimated utilizing the Genotype-Tissue Expression
              project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan offers
              tissue-specific direction of effects, such as whether a higher or
              lower predicted expression of a gene is associated with increased
              or decreased disease risk. Consequently, we utilized these
              $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy, which will be
              detailed in the subsequent section.


              Changes made:

              1. Replaced "the summary version" with "serves as the summary
              version" for clarity.

              2. Added "The latter" to distinguish PrediXcan from S-PrediXcan.

              3. Expanded on Equation 1 and provided a clearer definition of its
              variables.

              4. Reiterated that S-PrediXcan uses GWAS summary statistics for
              clarity.

              5. Specified the role of GTEx v8 as a reference panel.

              6. Reworded the final sentence for better flow and readability.

              tissues" ([@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776])] as a reference panel.
              Due to S-PrediXcan's ability to provide tissue-specific directions
              of effects (such as whether a higher or lower predicted expression
              of a gene is associated with increased or decreased disease risk),

              S-PrediXcan ("Summary" PrediXcan) serves as a condensed version of
              PrediXcan, with both tools leveraged to model a trait as a linear
              function of gene expression within a single tissue. The PrediXcan
              model employs the univariate equation:


              $$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l},$$
              {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ signifies the estimated effect size or
              regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes error terms
              with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. To evaluate association
              significance, a $z$-score ($\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
              \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$) is calculated for each tissue model
              ($l$).


              PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit the model;
              however, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only
              GWAS summary statistics. This approximation is formulated as:


              $$\hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},$$
              {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ denotes the variance of the predicted gene
              expression in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ signifies the
              estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In both TWAS
              methods, genotype variances and covariances are consistently
              estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
              as a reference panel.


              Considering S-PrediXcan's ability to provide tissue-specific
              directions of effects (e.g., whether increased or decreased
              predicted gene expression influences disease risk), we utilized
              $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy, as detailed below.

PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue, employing the univariate model expressed as equation (\ref{eq:predixcan}) in the original text. Here, $\\hat{\\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\\bm{\\epsilon}_l$ signifies the error terms with variance $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}$. To evaluate the significance of the association, S-PrediXcan calculates the $z$-score ($\\hat{z}_{l}=\\hat{\\gamma}_l / \\mathrm{se}(\\hat{\\gamma}_l)$) based on a gene's tissue model ($l$).\n\nIn contrast to PrediXcan, which requires individual-level data to fit its model, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics. This approximation is given by the expression in equation (\ref{eq:spredixcan}) of the original text and involves the following variables: $\\hat{\\sigma}_a$ (the variance of SNP $a$), $\\hat{\\sigma}_l$ (the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$), and $\\hat{\\beta}_a$ (the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS). In S-PrediXcan and related TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [\"A reference panel for tissue-specific genetic effects across 44 human tissues\" by The GTEx Consortium, Science (2020) doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.\n\nGiven that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects (for example, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene is associated with increased or decreased disease risk), we utilized $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy, which will be explained in the following section."
