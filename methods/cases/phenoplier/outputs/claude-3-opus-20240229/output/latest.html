In these transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) methods, the genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for instance, whether higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).

S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a summary-based version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a linear function of a gene&#39;s expression in a single tissue using the univariate model:

$$
&#92;mathbf{y} = &#92;mathbf{t_l &#92;gamma_l + &#92;bm{&#92;epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where $&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $&#92;bm{&#92;epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance $&#92;sigma_{&#92;epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is assessed by computing the $z$-score $&#92;hat{z}_{l}=&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l / &#92;mathrm{se}(&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l)$ for a gene&#39;s tissue model $l$. While PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics with the following expression:

$$
&#92;hat{z}_{l} &#92;approx &#92;sum_{a &#92;in model_{l}} w_a^l &#92;frac{&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_a}{&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_l} &#92;frac{&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_a}{&#92;mathrm{se}(&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

where $&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_a$ is the variance of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) $a$, $&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
