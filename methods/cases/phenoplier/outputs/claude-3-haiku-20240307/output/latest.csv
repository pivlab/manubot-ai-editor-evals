1. Introduced a topic sentence to clearly state the purpose of the paragraph.
2. Simplified the wording and sentence structure for better clarity.
3. Separated the definitions into bullet points for easier readability.
4. Removed unnecessary details and jargon (e.g., ""for convenience"", ""so that no intercept is necessary"").

S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics, with the expression:

$$

$$
