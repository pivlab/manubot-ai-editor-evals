Here we briefly describe the key details of the TWAS (Transcriptome-Wide Association Study) methods needed to explain our regression framework (see referenced articles for more information). We use the following notation:

$&#92;mathbf{y}$ is a vector of traits for $n$ individuals, centered for convenience (no intercept needed).
$&#92;tilde{&#92;mathbf{t}}_l = &#92;sum_{a &#92;in &#92;mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$ is the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, where $X_a$ is the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ is its weight in the tissue prediction model.
$&#92;mathbf{t}_l$ is the standardized version of $&#92;tilde{&#92;mathbf{t}}_l$, with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.

The key revisions are:

1. Introduced a topic sentence to clearly state the purpose of the paragraph.
2. Simplified the wording and sentence structure for better clarity.
3. Separated the definitions into bullet points for easier readability.
4. Removed unnecessary details and jargon (e.g., &quot;for convenience&quot;, &quot;so that no intercept is necessary&quot;).
5. Maintained the mathematical notation and definitions from the original paragraph.

Here we briefly outline the key details of the TWAS (transcriptome-wide association study) methods necessary to explain our regression framework (see referenced articles for more information). We use $&#92;mathbf{y}$ to denote a vector of traits for $n$ individuals, which has been centered for convenience (eliminating the need for an intercept term). The predicted expression for a gene in tissue $l$ is represented as $&#92;tilde{&#92;mathbf{t}}_l = &#92;sum_{a &#92;in &#92;mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$, where $X_a$ is the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ is its weight in the tissue prediction model $l$. We then standardize this predicted expression to obtain $&#92;mathbf{t}_l$, which has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

Here is my revised version of the paragraph:

S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a summary version of the PrediXcan method [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue using the univariate model:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for the gene's tissue model $l$. 

In contrast, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only summary-level GWAS data, without requiring individual-level data:

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of the gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. Both PrediXcan and S-PrediXcan use the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel to estimate genotype variances and covariances.

The S-PrediXcan method [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a summary version of the PrediXcan approach [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression in a single tissue using the univariate model:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only summary-level genome-wide association study (GWAS) statistics with the expression:

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) methods, the genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (i.e., whether higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).

# Revised Paragraph

The S-PrediXcan method [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a summary version of the PrediXcan approach [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the trait as a linear function of the gene&#39;s expression in a single tissue using the univariate model:

$$
&#92;mathbf{y} = &#92;mathbf{t}_l &#92;gamma_l + &#92;bm{&#92;epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where $&#92;mathbf{t}_l$ is the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, $&#92;gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $&#92;bm{&#92;epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance $&#92;sigma_{&#92;epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is assessed by computing the $z$-score $&#92;hat{z}_{l}=&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l / &#92;mathrm{se}(&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l)$ for the gene&#39;s tissue model $l$.

In contrast, S-PrediXcan approximates the PrediXcan $z$-scores using only genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics, without requiring individual-level data. The S-PrediXcan $z$-score is calculated as:

The S-PrediXcan method [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a simplified version of the PrediXcan approach [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression in a single tissue using the following univariate model:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for each gene's tissue model $l$.

In contrast, S-PrediXcan approximates the PrediXcan $z$-scores using only summary-level GWAS data, as follows:

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. Both PrediXcan and S-PrediXcan use the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel to estimate the necessary genotype variances and covariances.

Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific effect directions (i.e., whether higher or lower predicted gene expression confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach (described below).

S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a summary version of the PrediXcan method [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression in a single tissue using the univariate model:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

The significance of the association is assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. 

In contrast, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only summary-level GWAS data, without requiring individual-level data. The S-PrediXcan $z$-score is calculated as:

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a summary version of the PrediXcan method [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the trait as a linear function of the gene&#39;s expression in a single tissue using the univariate model:

$$
&#92;mathbf{y} = &#92;mathbf{t_l &#92;gamma_l + &#92;bm{&#92;epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where $&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $&#92;bm{&#92;epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance $&#92;sigma_{&#92;epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is assessed by computing the $z$-score $&#92;hat{z}_{l}=&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l / &#92;mathrm{se}(&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l)$ for each gene-tissue model $l$. 

In contrast, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only summary-level GWAS data, without requiring individual-level data. The S-PrediXcan $z$-score is calculated as:

$$
&#92;hat{z}_{l} &#92;approx &#92;sum_{a &#92;in model_{l}} w_a^l &#92;frac{&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_a}{&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_l} &#92;frac{&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_a}{&#92;mathrm{se}(&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

where $&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. Both PrediXcan and S-PrediXcan use the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel to estimate genotype variances and covariances.

The tissue-specific $z$-scores from S-PrediXcan were used in our drug repurposing approach (described below).
