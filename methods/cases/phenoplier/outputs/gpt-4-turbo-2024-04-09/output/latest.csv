The significance of the association is assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.

S-PrediXcan [1] is a streamlined version of the PrediXcan method [2]. PrediXcan characterizes the trait as a linear function of gene expression in a specific tissue using the univariate model:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for each gene-tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to implement this model. In contrast, S-PrediXcan estimates the PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics as per the following expression:

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. These transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) consistently utilize genotype variances and covariances estimated from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [3] as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan provides insights into the tissue-specific direction of effects, such as whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene increases or decreases disease risk, which we have applied in our drug repurposing strategy (described subsequently).

In this equation, $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. We assess the significance of the association by calculating the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for each gene's tissue model $l$. Unlike PrediXcan, which requires individual-level data to fit this model, S-PrediXcan estimates the PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics as shown below:

$$

Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. These Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) methods consistently use the genotype variances and covariances estimated from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.

S-PrediXcan (Dhindsa et al., 2018) serves as the summary-based counterpart to PrediXcan (Gamazon et al., 2015). PrediXcan quantifies the trait as a linear function of gene expression within a specific tissue using the model:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of each gene-tissue association is determined by calculating the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to implement this model. Conversely, S-PrediXcan estimates the PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics through the formula:

PrediXcan requires individual-level data to estimate these parameters.

Conversely, S-PrediXcan approximates the PrediXcan-derived $z$-scores using only genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics. This approximation is expressed as:

$$

where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ and $\hat{\beta}_a$ are the variance and estimated effect size of SNP $a$, respectively, and $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$. The genotype variances and covariances required for these calculations are typically sourced from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [DOI: 10.1126/science.aaz1776].

S-PrediXcan's ability to provide tissue-specific directional effects (indicating whether higher or lower predicted gene expression alters disease risk) is particularly useful in contexts such as drug repurposing, which we explore further in the subsequent sections of this manuscript.

S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] represents a condensed version of the PrediXcan methodology [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a linear function of gene expression within a single tissue using the following univariate model:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

In this equation, $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with a variance of $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of each gene-tissue association is determined by calculating the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for each tissue-specific gene model $l$. While PrediXcan requires individual-level data to establish this model, S-PrediXcan approximates the PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics, as described by the following expression:

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. These transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) techniques consistently utilize the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference for estimating genotype variances and covariances. S-PrediXcan provides insights into the tissue-specific direction of effects, such as whether higher or lower predicted expression of a gene increases or decreases disease risk.

where \(\mathbf{t}_l\) represents the predicted expression of a gene in tissue \(l\), \(\gamma_l\) is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and \(\bm{\epsilon}_l\) denotes the error terms with variance \(\sigma_{\epsilon}^2\). The significance of the association is determined by calculating the \(z\)-score \(\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)\) for each gene's model in tissue \(l\). PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model.

S-PrediXcan provides insights into the tissue-specific directionality of effects, such as whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene increases or decreases disease risk.

S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a simplified version of the PrediXcan method [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a linear function of gene expression in a specific tissue. This is represented by the univariate model:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where $\gamma_l$ is the estimated regression coefficient or effect size, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the genetic association is determined by calculating the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l} = \frac{\hat{\gamma}_l}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)}$, for each tissue-specific gene model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to estimate this model. In contrast, S-PrediXcan estimates the PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics, as shown by the equation:

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ and $\hat{\sigma}_l$ are the variances of SNP $a$ and the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, respectively, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
