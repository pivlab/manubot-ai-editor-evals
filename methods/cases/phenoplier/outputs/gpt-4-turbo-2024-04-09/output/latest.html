Here, we provide essential details about the transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) methods relevant to our regression framework, which will be discussed later (for further information, refer to the cited articles). We denote $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector representing traits of $n$ individuals, which has been centered for analytical convenience (eliminating the need for an intercept). The term $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ represents the predicted gene expression across all individuals in tissue $l$, calculated as $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$, where $X_a$ is the genotype of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) $a$, and $w_{a}^{l}$ is its corresponding weight in the tissue-specific prediction model $l$. Additionally, $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the standardized form of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, adjusted to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a streamlined version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a linear function of gene expression in a specific tissue. This relationship is described using the equation:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with a variance of $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the gene-tissue association is determined by calculating the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for each gene's tissue model $l$.

\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), the variances and covariances of genotypes are estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific directions of effects, indicating whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene increases or decreases disease risk. This capability is utilized in our drug repurposing strategy described later.

S-PrediXcan, as detailed by Barbeira et al. (2018) [DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1], serves as the summary data-based adaptation of PrediXcan, originally developed by Gamazon et al. (2015) [DOI: 10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan quantifies the association between a trait and gene expression in a specific tissue by modeling the trait as a linear function of gene expression using the equation:

$$
&#92;mathbf{y} = &#92;mathbf{t}_l &#92;gamma_l + &#92;bm{&#92;epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where $&#92;gamma_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $&#92;bm{&#92;epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms with variance $&#92;sigma_{&#92;epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of each gene-tissue association is determined by calculating the $z$-score, $&#92;hat{z}_{l} = &#92;frac{&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l}{&#92;mathrm{se}(&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l)}$, for each gene&#39;s tissue-specific model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to estimate these parameters.

Conversely, S-PrediXcan approximates the PrediXcan-derived $z$-scores using only genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics. This approximation is expressed as:

where $&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_a$ and $&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_a$ are the variance and estimated effect size of SNP $a$, respectively, and $&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$. The genotype variances and covariances required for these calculations are typically sourced from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [DOI: 10.1126/science.aaz1776].

S-PrediXcan&#39;s ability to provide tissue-specific directional effects (indicating whether higher or lower predicted gene expression alters disease risk) is particularly useful in contexts such as drug repurposing, which we explore further in the subsequent sections of this manuscript.

\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where $\mathbf{t}_l$ denotes the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is determined by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for each gene's tissue model $l$. While PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, S-PrediXcan utilizes only GWAS summary statistics to approximate these $z$-scores, as given by the equation:

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. These transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) methods consistently utilize genotype variances and covariances estimated from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan provides insights into the tissue-specific directionality of effects, such as whether higher or lower predicted gene expression is associated with increased or decreased disease risk, which we have employed in our drug repurposing strategy (described subsequently).

S-PrediXcan (Barbeira et al., 2018) is a method derived from PrediXcan (Gamazon et al., 2015) that summarizes the latter&#39;s approach.

S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a streamlined version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a linear function of gene expression in a specific tissue using the following univariate model:

$$
&#92;mathbf{y} = &#92;mathbf{t}_l &#92;gamma_l + &#92;bm{&#92;epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

Here, $&#92;mathbf{t}_l$ represents the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, $&#92;gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $&#92;bm{&#92;epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance $&#92;sigma_{&#92;epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of each gene-tissue association is determined by calculating the $z$-score, $&#92;hat{z}_{l} = &#92;frac{&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l}{&#92;mathrm{se}(&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l)}$, for each tissue model $l$. While PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, S-PrediXcan estimates the PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics, as shown in the equation:

$$
&#92;hat{z}_{l} &#92;approx &#92;sum_{a &#92;in model_{l}} w_a^l &#92;frac{&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_a}{&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_l} &#92;frac{&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_a}{&#92;mathrm{se}(&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

In this expression, $&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and $&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from GWAS. These transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) methods always use genotype variances and covariances estimated from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan provides insights into the tissue-specific direction of effects, indicating whether higher or lower predicted expression of a gene is associated with increased or decreased disease risk. These $z$-scores are integral to our drug repurposing strategy, detailed further below.

&#92;mathbf{y} = &#92;mathbf{t_l &#92;gamma_l + &#92;bm{&#92;epsilon}_l},
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where $&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $&#92;bm{&#92;epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms with a variance of $&#92;sigma_{&#92;epsilon}^{2}$. To evaluate the significance of the association, a $z$-score, $&#92;hat{z}_{l} = &#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l / &#92;mathrm{se}(&#92;hat{&#92;gamma}_l)$, is calculated for each gene&#39;s tissue-specific model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to implement this model. In contrast, S-PrediXcan estimates the PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics, as shown in the expression:

$$
&#92;hat{z}_{l} &#92;approx &#92;sum_{a &#92;in model_{l}} w_a^l &#92;frac{&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_a}{&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_l} &#92;frac{&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_a}{&#92;mathrm{se}(&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

Here, $&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $&#92;hat{&#92;sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and $&#92;hat{&#92;beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. The variance and covariance of genotypes in these transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) are consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan provides insights into the tissue-specific direction of effects, such as whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene increases or decreases disease risk, which we utilize in our drug repurposing strategy (described later).

S-PrediXcan (Gamazon et al., 2018) is a streamlined version of the PrediXcan method (Gamazon et al., 2015) which models a trait as a linear function of gene expression in a specific tissue using a univariate model:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,
$$ {#eq:predixcan}

where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^2$. The significance of the association is determined by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for each tissue-specific gene model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model. In contrast, S-PrediXcan estimates the PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics, as expressed by:

$$
\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l} \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},
$$ {#eq:spredixcan}

where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), genotype variances and covariances are consistently estimated using data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) (GTEx Consortium, 2020) as the reference panel.
