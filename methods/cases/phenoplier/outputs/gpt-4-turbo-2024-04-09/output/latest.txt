          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: Here we briefly provide the details about these TWAS
          methods that are necessary to explain our regression framework later
          (see the referenced articles for more information). In the following,
          we refer to $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of traits for $n$ individuals
          that is centered for convenience (so that no intercept is necessary);
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$
          is the gene's predicted expression for all individuals in tissue $l$,
          $X_a$ is the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ its weight in the tissue
          prediction model $l$; and $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the standardized version
          of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ with mean equal to zero and standard
          deviation equal to one.

          In this section, we provide essential details regarding the
          Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) methods used to support
          our regression framework, which will be discussed later (for further
          details, please refer to the cited articles). Throughout this
          manuscript, we denote $\mathbf{y}$ as the vector representing traits
          of $n$ individuals, which has been centered to obviate the need for an
          intercept. The term $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ represents the predicted
          gene expression across all individuals in tissue $l$, calculated as
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l}
          X_{a}$, where $X_a$ is the genotype of single nucleotide polymorphism
          (SNP) $a$ and $w_{a}^l$ is its corresponding weight in the
          tissue-specific prediction model $l$. Finally, $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the
          standardized form of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, adjusted to have a mean
          of zero and a standard deviation of one.

          In this section, we provide essential details about the
          Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) methods necessary for
          understanding our regression framework, which will be discussed later
          (for more comprehensive information, please refer to the cited
          articles). Here, $\mathbf{y}$ represents a vector of traits for $n$
          individuals, which has been centered to eliminate the need for an
          intercept. The predicted gene expression for all individuals in a
          specific tissue type $l$, denoted as $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, is
          calculated using the formula $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in
          \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$. In this equation, $X_a$ represents
          the genotype of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) $a$, and
          $w_{a}^{l}$ is the corresponding weight of SNP $a$ in the
          tissue-specific prediction model $l$. Additionally, $\mathbf{t}_l$
          refers to the standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, adjusted
          to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

          In this section, we outline the key aspects of the Transcriptome-Wide
          Association Study (TWAS) methods relevant for understanding our later
          discussion on the regression framework (for comprehensive details,
          refer to the cited articles). We denote $\mathbf{y}$ as the vector
          representing traits of $n$ individuals, which is centered to eliminate
          the need for an intercept. The predicted gene expression for each
          individual in tissue $l$ is represented by $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l =
          \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$, where $X_a$ is the
          genotype of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) $a$, and $w_{a}^{l}$
          is its corresponding weight in the tissue-specific prediction model.
          The standardized form of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, denoted as
          $\mathbf{t}_l$, has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan [1] is a streamlined version of the PrediXcan method [2].
          PrediXcan characterizes the trait as a linear function of gene
          expression in a specific tissue using the univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms
          with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
          association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l} =
          \hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for each gene-tissue
          model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to implement this
          model. In contrast, S-PrediXcan estimates the PrediXcan $z$-scores
          using only GWAS summary statistics as per the following expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          These transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) consistently
          utilize genotype variances and covariances estimated from the
          Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [3] as the reference
          panel. S-PrediXcan provides insights into the tissue-specific
          direction of effects, such as whether a higher or lower predicted
          expression of a gene increases or decreases disease risk, which we
          have applied in our drug repurposing strategy (described
          subsequently).

          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics

          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon,
          maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your
          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
          and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a streamlined version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a linear
          function of gene expression in a specific tissue. This relationship is
          described using the equation:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error
          terms with a variance of $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of
          the gene-tissue association is determined by calculating the
          $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for each gene's tissue model $l$. While
          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model,
          S-PrediXcan estimates the PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics, as shown in the following expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          These Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies (TWAS) methods
          consistently utilize genotype variances and covariances estimated from
          the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)

          provides insights into the tissue-specific direction of effects, such
          as whether higher or lower predicted gene expression is associated
          with increased or decreased disease risk. We integrate these

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).


          Revised paragraph:

          S-PrediXcan (Dhindsa et al., 2018) serves as the summary-based
          counterpart to PrediXcan (Gamazon et al., 2015). PrediXcan quantifies
          the trait as a linear function of gene expression within a specific
          tissue using the model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms
          with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of each
          gene-tissue association is determined by calculating the $z$-score,
          $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$.
          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to implement this model.
          Conversely, S-PrediXcan estimates the PrediXcan $z$-scores using only
          GWAS summary statistics through the formula:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          The genotype variances and covariances utilized in these
          transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) are consistently
          estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) (GTEx
          Consortium, 2020) as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan provides
          insights into the tissue-specific directionality of effects, such as
          whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene is associated
          with increased or decreased disease risk. We utilized these $z$-scores
          in our drug repurposing strategy, which is detailed in the following

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
          formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information
          as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve
          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly
          defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure
          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear
          in the original text; these references are crucial for academic
          integrity and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as
          "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a simplified version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait using a
          linear function of gene expression in a specific tissue. The model is
          represented by the equation:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ indicates the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms
          with a variance of $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
          gene-tissue association is determined by calculating the $z$-score,
          $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for each
          gene-tissue model $l$. While PrediXcan requires individual-level data
          to fit this model, S-PrediXcan utilizes only GWAS summary statistics
          to approximate these $z$-scores, as shown by the equation:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          In this expression, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP
          $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression
          in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP
          $a$ from the GWAS. These transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS)
          always estimate genotype variances and covariances using the
          Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan
          provides insights into the direction of effects specific to tissues,
          indicating whether higher or lower predicted gene expression alters
          disease risk. This information is crucial in our drug repurposing
          strategies, as detailed later in the manuscript.

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] represents a streamlined
          version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a
          linear function of gene expression in a specific tissue. This

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or

          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a derived method from
          PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a linear
          function of gene expression in a single tissue using the following
          univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\gamma_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association
          is determined by calculating the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l} =
          \frac{\hat{\gamma}_l}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)}$, for each gene's
          tissue-specific model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to
          fit this model; however, S-PrediXcan utilizes GWAS summary statistics
          to approximate these $z$-scores as follows:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          These Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) methods consistently
          utilize genotype variances and covariances estimated from the
          Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan
          provides insights into the tissue-specific direction of effects,
          indicating whether a higher or lower predicted gene expression is
          associated with increased or decreased disease risk. These $z$-scores
          are integral to our drug repurposing strategy, as detailed in the
          subsequent section.

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] represents a
          summary-based adaptation of the PrediXcan methodology
          [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a linear function of
          gene expression in a specific tissue via a univariate model:

          In this equation, $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size
          or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error
          terms, with a variance denoted by $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The

          function of a gene's expression in a single tissue using the following
          univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          In this equation, $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect
          size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the
          error terms, which have a variance of $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The
          significance of the gene-tissue association is evaluated by
          calculating the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for each gene-tissue model $l$. While
          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model,
          S-PrediXcan uses only GWAS summary statistics to approximate the
          PrediXcan $z$-scores as shown below:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          The variances and covariances of the genotypes are consistently
          estimated using data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan
          provides insights into the tissue-specific direction of gene
          expression effects on disease risk, which is integral to our drug
          repurposing strategy (described later).

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).


          Revised paragraph:

          S-PrediXcan, as described in [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1], is a
          derivative method of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367] that simplifies
          the analysis by utilizing only GWAS summary statistics. PrediXcan
          quantifies the association between a trait and gene expression in a
          specific tissue through a linear model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\gamma_l$ represents the estimated regression coefficient or
          effect size, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms with a
          variance of $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of this
          association is determined by calculating the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l} =
          \hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for each gene-tissue
          model $l$. Unlike PrediXcan, which requires individual-level data to
          estimate these models, S-PrediXcan approximates the PrediXcan
          $z$-scores using the following expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ and $\hat{\sigma}_l$ are the variances of SNP
          $a$ and the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, respectively, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from GWAS.
          These genotype variances and covariances are typically estimated using
          the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference dataset. S-PrediXcan
          is particularly useful for determining the tissue-specific direction
          of gene expression effects on disease risk, an aspect we leverage in
          our drug repurposing strategy outlined below.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon,
          maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your
          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
          and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a streamlined version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a linear
          function of gene expression in a single tissue using a univariate
          model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          In this equation, $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect
          size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the
          error terms with a variance of $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The
          significance of the association is determined by calculating the
          $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$
          for each gene's tissue model $l$. Unlike PrediXcan, which requires
          individual-level data, S-PrediXcan estimates the PrediXcan $z$-scores
          using only GWAS summary statistics as shown here:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), the variances
          and covariances of genotypes are estimated using the Genotype-Tissue
          Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the
          reference panel. S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific directions of
          effects, indicating whether a higher or lower predicted expression of
          a gene increases or decreases disease risk. This capability is
          utilized in our drug repurposing strategy described later.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since

          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene

          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan, as detailed by Barbeira et al. (2018) [DOI:
          10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1], serves as the summary data-based
          adaptation of PrediXcan, originally developed by Gamazon et al. (2015)
          [DOI: 10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan quantifies the association between a
          trait and gene expression in a specific tissue by modeling the trait
          as a linear function of gene expression using the equation:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\gamma_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of each gene-tissue
          association is determined by calculating the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l} =
          \frac{\hat{\gamma}_l}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)}$, for each gene's
          tissue-specific model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to
          estimate these parameters.


          Conversely, S-PrediXcan approximates the PrediXcan-derived $z$-scores
          using only genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics.
          This approximation is expressed as:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ and $\hat{\beta}_a$ are the variance and
          estimated effect size of SNP $a$, respectively, and $\hat{\sigma}_l$
          is the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$. The
          genotype variances and covariances required for these calculations are
          typically sourced from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [DOI: 10.1126/science.aaz1776].


          S-PrediXcan's ability to provide tissue-specific directional effects
          (indicating whether higher or lower predicted gene expression alters
          disease risk) is particularly useful in contexts such as drug
          repurposing, which we explore further in the subsequent sections of
          this manuscript.

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
          formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information
          as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve
          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly
          defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure
          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear
          in the original text; these references are crucial for academic
          integrity and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as
          "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] represents a condensed
          version of the PrediXcan methodology [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which
          models a trait as a linear function of gene expression within a single
          tissue using the following univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          In this equation, $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size
          or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error
          terms with a variance of $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of
          each gene-tissue association is determined by calculating the
          $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$,
          for each tissue-specific gene model $l$. While PrediXcan requires
          individual-level data to establish this model, S-PrediXcan
          approximates the PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics, as described by the following expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          These transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) techniques
          consistently utilize the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference for estimating
          genotype variances and covariances. S-PrediXcan provides insights into
          the tissue-specific direction of effects, such as whether higher or
          lower predicted expression of a gene increases or decreases disease
          risk. These $z$-scores are integral to our strategy for drug
          repurposing, which is elaborated in the subsequent sections.

          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l

          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the summary version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the trait as a
          linear function of the gene's expression on a single tissue using the
          univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan, as detailed in [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1],
          represents a summary-based adaptation of the PrediXcan method, which
          is originally described in [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models a
          trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a specific tissue
          using the following univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ denotes the predicted gene expression in tissue
          $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association
          is determined by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l} =
          \hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for each gene's tissue
          model $l$. While PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this
          model, S-PrediXcan utilizes only GWAS summary statistics to
          approximate these $z$-scores, as given by the equation:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          These transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) methods consistently
          utilize genotype variances and covariances estimated from the
          Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan
          provides insights into the tissue-specific directionality of effects,
          such as whether higher or lower predicted gene expression is
          associated with increased or decreased disease risk, which we have
          employed in our drug repurposing strategy (described subsequently).

          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics

          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are

          form of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan quantifies the
          trait as a linear function of gene expression in a specific tissue
          using the following univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. To determine the significance of the
          association, the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ is calculated for each gene's tissue
          model $l$. While PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this
          model, S-PrediXcan estimates the PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS
          summary statistics as shown in the following expression:

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l

          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the gene-tissue
          association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l} =
          \hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$.


          While PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model,
          S-PrediXcan utilizes GWAS summary statistics to approximate PrediXcan
          $z$-scores, as shown in the following expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ and $\hat{\sigma}_l$ represent the variances of
          SNP $a$ and the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, respectively,
          and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$. The
          variance and covariance of genotypes used in these transcriptome-wide
          association studies (TWAS) are estimated using data from the
          Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference. S-PrediXcan offers
          insight into the tissue-specific direction of gene expression effects
          on disease risk, which is instrumental in our drug repurposing
          strategies described later.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).


          Revised paragraph:

          S-PrediXcan [1] represents a summary-based adaptation of the PrediXcan
          framework [2]. PrediXcan quantifies the relationship between a trait
          and gene expression in a specific tissue by employing a linear model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ denotes the predicted gene expression in tissue
          $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with a
          variance of $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
          association is determined by calculating the $z$-score,
          $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for each
          gene-tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to
          construct this model. In contrast, S-PrediXcan estimates the PrediXcan
          $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics, as per the following
          formula:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ signifies the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression in
          tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ represents the estimated effect size
          of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. These transcriptome-wide association study
          (TWAS) methods consistently utilize genotype variances and covariances
          estimated from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [3] as
          the reference panel. S-PrediXcan offers insights into the
          tissue-specific directionality of gene expression effects, such as
          whether increased or decreased predicted expression of a gene is
          associated with higher or lower disease risk. We leverage these
          $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy (described subsequently).

          Here, $\mathbf{t}_l$ denotes the predicted gene expression in tissue

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon,
          maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your
          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
          and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] serves as a
          summary-based extension of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan
          models a trait using a linear function of gene expression in a
          specific tissue, represented by the following univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ denotes the predicted gene expression in tissue
          $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the gene-tissue
          association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score
          $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for each
          tissue model $l$. While PrediXcan requires individual-level data to
          estimate these parameters, S-PrediXcan approximates these $z$-scores
          using only GWAS summary statistics through the expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          These transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) always use the
          genotype variances and covariances estimated from the Genotype-Tissue
          Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the
          reference panel. S-PrediXcan offers insights into the tissue-specific
          direction of effects, indicating whether higher or lower predicted
          expression of a gene increases or decreases disease risk. These
          $z$-scores are subsequently utilized in our drug repurposing
          methodology, detailed later in the text.

          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,

          S-PrediXcan (Barbeira et al., 2018) is a method derived from PrediXcan
          (Gamazon et al., 2015) that summarizes the latter's approach.
          PrediXcan quantifies the association between a trait and gene
          expression in a specific tissue by modeling the trait as a linear
          function of the predicted gene expression using the equation:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$


          where \(\mathbf{t}_l\) represents the predicted expression of a gene
          in tissue \(l\), \(\gamma_l\) is the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient, and \(\bm{\epsilon}_l\) denotes the error
          terms with variance \(\sigma_{\epsilon}^2\). The significance of the
          association is determined by calculating the \(z\)-score \(\hat{z}_{l}
          = \hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)\) for each gene's model
          in tissue \(l\). PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this
          model.


          In contrast, S-PrediXcan approximates the PrediXcan \(z\)-scores using
          only GWAS summary statistics through the following expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$


          where \(\hat{\sigma}_a\) is the variance of SNP \(a\),
          \(\hat{\sigma}_l\) is the variance of the predicted gene expression in
          tissue \(l\), and \(\hat{\beta}_a\) is the estimated effect size of
          SNP \(a\) from the GWAS. These Transcriptome-Wide Association Study
          (TWAS) methods consistently utilize genotype variances and covariances
          estimated from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          (Consortium, 2020) as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan provides
          insights into the tissue-specific directionality of effects, such as
          whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene increases or
          decreases disease risk. This capability was leveraged in our drug
          repurposing strategy, detailed subsequently.

          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a streamlined version
          of the PrediXcan methodology [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a
          trait as a linear function of gene expression within a single tissue
          using the following univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          In this equation, $\mathbf{t}_l$ represents the predicted expression
          of a gene in tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms,
          which have a variance of $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of
          the genetic association is determined by calculating the $z$-score,
          $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for each
          tissue-specific gene model $l$. While PrediXcan requires
          individual-level data to fit this model, S-PrediXcan can estimate
          PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics, as shown by
          the following approximation:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression in
          tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP
          $a$ from the GWAS. These transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS)
          methods consistently utilize genotype variances and covariances
          estimated by the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as their reference panel. S-PrediXcan
          provides insights into the tissue-specific direction of effects, such
          as whether higher or lower predicted expression of a gene increases or
          decreases disease risk. This information is crucial for our drug
          repurposing strategy (details discussed later).

          paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon,
          maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your
          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
          formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information
          as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve
          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly
          defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure
          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear
          in the original text; these references are crucial for academic
          integrity and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as
          "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a streamlined version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a linear
          function of gene expression in a specific tissue using the following
          univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          Here, $\mathbf{t}_l$ represents the predicted gene expression in
          tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the gene-tissue
          association is determined by calculating the $z$-score,
          $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for each
          tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to
          construct this model. In contrast, S-PrediXcan estimates the PrediXcan
          $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics, as shown in the
          following expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          These transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) methods consistently
          utilize genotype variances and covariances estimated using the
          Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan
          provides insights into the tissue-specific direction of effects, such
          as whether higher or lower predicted gene expression alters disease
          risk, which we leverage in our drug repurposing strategy (described
          later).

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a simplified version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], designed to predict the impact of
          gene expression on various traits. PrediXcan uses a linear model to
          relate a trait to the expression of a gene in a specific tissue,
          represented by the equation:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ denotes the predicted gene expression in tissue
          $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms, assumed
          to have a variance of $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of
          this association is determined by calculating the $z$-score
          $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for each

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).


          Revised paragraph:

          S-PrediXcan, as detailed in [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1], is a
          derivative model of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], designed to
          analyze the association between gene expression and traits using only
          summary-level data. PrediXcan models the trait as a linear function of
          the predicted gene expression in a given tissue, based on a univariate
          model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ represents the predicted gene expression in
          tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the regression coefficient or estimated
          effect size, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the gene-tissue
          association is quantified using the $z$-score, calculated as
          $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$.


          In contrast, S-PrediXcan approximates the PrediXcan $z$-scores using
          GWAS summary statistics through the following expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression for a
          gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size
          of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. Genotype variances and covariances are
          estimated using data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan
          provides insights into the tissue-specific direction of effects, which
          is pivotal for understanding whether variations in gene expression
          increase or decrease disease risk. This methodology was utilized in
          our drug repurposing strategy, as described in subsequent sections.

          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly

          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear

          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] represents a simplified
          version of the PrediXcan methodology [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which
          models a trait as a linear function of gene expression in a specific

          Here, $\mathbf{t}_l$ denotes the predicted expression of a gene in
          tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms, which
          have a variance denoted by $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance
          of the association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score,
          $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for each
          gene's tissue model $l$. Unlike PrediXcan, which requires
          individual-level data to fit this model, S-PrediXcan estimates
          PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics through the

          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a linear
          function of gene expression in a specific tissue using the following
          univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          Here, $\mathbf{t}_l$ represents the predicted expression of a gene in
          tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of each gene-tissue
          association is determined by calculating the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l} =
          \frac{\hat{\gamma}_l}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)}$, for each tissue
          model $l$. While PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this
          model, S-PrediXcan estimates the PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS
          summary statistics, as shown in the equation:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          In this expression, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression in
          tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP
          $a$ from GWAS. These transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS)
          methods always use genotype variances and covariances estimated from
          the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan
          provides insights into the tissue-specific direction of effects,
          indicating whether higher or lower predicted expression of a gene is
          associated with increased or decreased disease risk. These $z$-scores
          are integral to our drug repurposing strategy, detailed further below.

          S-PrediXcan [1] is a streamlined version of PrediXcan [2]. PrediXcan
          quantifies a trait as a linear function of gene expression in a single
          tissue using a univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l},

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms
          with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
          association is determined by calculating the $z$-score
          $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for each
          gene-tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to
          establish this model. In contrast, S-PrediXcan approximates the
          PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics as follows:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l

          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          These transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) methods consistently
          utilize the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) [3] as the
          reference panel for estimating genotype variances and covariances.
          Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific insights into the direction
          of effects (e.g., whether higher or lower predicted gene expression is
          associated with increased or decreased disease risk), it was utilized
          in our drug repurposing strategy, as detailed below.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon,
          maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your
          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
          and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;

          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a streamlined version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait based on the
          expression of a gene in a specific tissue through a simple linear
          model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\gamma_l$ represents the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms with a
          variance of $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
          gene-tissue association is determined by calculating the $z$-score,
          $\hat{z}_l = \frac{\hat{\gamma}_l}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)}$, for
          each tissue-specific gene model $l$. While PrediXcan requires
          individual-level data to establish this model, S-PrediXcan can
          estimate these $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics through
          the following expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_l \approx \sum_{a \in \text{model}_l} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
          formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information
          as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve
          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly
          defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure
          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear
          in the original text; these references are crucial for academic
          integrity and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as

          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a simplified version
          of the PrediXcan method [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait
          as a linear function of gene expression in a specific tissue. This is
          represented by the univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\gamma_l$ is the estimated regression coefficient or effect
          size, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the genetic association
          is determined by calculating the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l} =
          \frac{\hat{\gamma}_l}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)}$, for each
          tissue-specific gene model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level
          data to estimate this model. In contrast, S-PrediXcan estimates the
          PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics, as shown by
          the equation:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ and $\hat{\sigma}_l$ are the variances of SNP
          $a$ and the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, respectively, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          These Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) methods consistently
          use the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel for estimating
          genotype variances and covariances. S-PrediXcan provides insights into
          the tissue-specific direction of effects, such as whether an increase
          or decrease in predicted gene expression is associated with higher or
          lower disease risk. We leverage these $z$-scores in our strategy for
          drug repurposing, detailed later in the manuscript.

          $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
          specific gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level
          data to fit this model. In contrast, S-PrediXcan estimates the
          PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics as follows:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          These transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) methods
          consistently use genotype variances and covariances estimated from the
          Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) (Consortium, 2020) as the
          reference panel. S-PrediXcan provides insights into the
          tissue-specific direction of effects, indicating whether higher or
          lower predicted expression of a gene increases or decreases disease
          risk. Consequently, we utilized these $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing strategy (further detailed below).

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
          formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information
          as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve
          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly
          defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure
          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear
          in the original text; these references are crucial for academic
          integrity and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as

          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}

          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] represents a streamlined
          version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a
          linear function of gene expression in a single tissue using the
          following univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\gamma_l$ is the estimated regression coefficient, indicating
          the effect size, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the genetic
          association is determined by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l} =
          \frac{\hat{\gamma}_l}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)}$, which assesses
          the model for a specific tissue $l$. PrediXcan requires
          individual-level data to establish this model. In contrast,
          S-PrediXcan estimates the PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics, as shown in the equation:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in \text{model}_l} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$
          represents the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue
          $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from
          the GWAS. These Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) methods
          consistently use the genotype variances and covariances estimated from

          offers insights into the tissue-specific directions of effects, such
          as whether higher or lower predicted gene expressions are associated
          with increased or decreased disease risk. This capability is integral
          to our approach for drug repurposing, detailed later in the
          manuscript.

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a summary-based
          adaptation of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait
          as a linear function of gene expression in a specific tissue. This is

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l},

          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).


          Revised paragraph:

          S-PrediXcan is a streamlined version of PrediXcan, designed to predict
          genetic associations using only genome-wide association study (GWAS)
          summary statistics. PrediXcan models the trait of interest as a linear
          function of gene expression in a specific tissue based on a univariate
          model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l},

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms
          with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of each
          association is quantified by calculating the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l} =
          \hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for each gene's
          expression model in tissue $l$. While PrediXcan requires
          individual-level data to fit this model, S-PrediXcan estimates the
          PrediXcan $z$-scores using GWAS summary statistics through the
          following approximation:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ and $\hat{\beta}_a$ are the variance and
          estimated effect size of SNP $a$, respectively, and $\hat{\sigma}_l$
          is the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$. Both
          TWAS methods, PrediXcan and S-PrediXcan, rely on genotype variances
          and covariances estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project
          (GTEx v8) as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan is particularly useful
          for determining the direction of tissue-specific effects, such as
          whether higher or lower predicted gene expression is associated with
          increased or decreased disease risk. This feature is integral to our
          drug repurposing strategy, detailed in the following section.

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a streamlined version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a linear
          function of gene expression in a specific tissue using a univariate
          model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l},

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms
          with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. To assess the significance of
          the association, the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ is calculated for each tissue-specific
          gene model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to estimate
          this model. In contrast, S-PrediXcan estimates the PrediXcan
          $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics, as shown in the
          following expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          These transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) methods consistently
          use the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon,
          maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your
          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
          and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

        output: >-
          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a streamlined version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a linear
          function of gene expression in a single tissue based on a univariate
          model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms
          with a variance of $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
          association is determined by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l} =
          \hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for each gene's tissue
          model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to establish this
          model. In contrast, S-PrediXcan estimates the PrediXcan $z$-scores
          using only GWAS summary statistics through the expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          These transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) methods consistently
          utilize genotype variances and covariances estimated from the
          Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific directional effects (indicating
          whether higher or lower predicted gene expression increases or
          decreases disease risk), we incorporated these $z$-scores into our
          drug repurposing strategy (described subsequently).

              In this section, we provide essential details regarding the
              Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) methods used to
              support our regression framework, which will be discussed later
              (for further details, please refer to the cited articles).
              Throughout this manuscript, we denote $\mathbf{y}$ as the vector
              representing traits of $n$ individuals, which has been centered to
              obviate the need for an intercept. The term $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$
              represents the predicted gene expression across all individuals in
              tissue $l$, calculated as $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in
              \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$, where $X_a$ is the genotype of
              single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) $a$ and $w_{a}^l$ is its
              corresponding weight in the tissue-specific prediction model $l$.
              Finally, $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the standardized form of
              $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, adjusted to have a mean of zero and a
              standard deviation of one.

              In this section, we outline the Transcriptome-Wide Association
              Study (TWAS) methods essential for understanding the regression
              framework discussed later (for detailed information, refer to the
              cited articles). We denote $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector representing
              the traits of $n$ individuals, which has been centered to
              eliminate the need for an intercept. The predicted gene expression
              for all individuals in tissue $l$ is represented by
              $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l}
              X_{a}$, where $X_a$ is the genotype of single nucleotide
              polymorphism (SNP) $a$ and $w_{a}^{l}$ is its corresponding weight
              in the tissue-specific prediction model. The standardized form of
              $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, denoted as $\mathbf{t}_l$, is adjusted to
              have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

              the text, 2) preserve technical details such as mathematical
              expressions, 3) ensure that equations (which could be numbered)
              are preserved and correctly defined, 4) preserve references to
              numbered equations, and 5) ensure most references to scientific
              articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text;
              these references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear

              In this section, we outline the essential details of the
              Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) methods used in our
              analysis, which will be discussed further in relation to our
              regression framework (for more comprehensive details, refer to the
              cited literature). We define $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector representing
              the traits of $n$ individuals, which has been centered for
              analytical convenience, eliminating the need for an intercept. The
              predicted gene expression for all individuals in tissue $l$,
              denoted as $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, is calculated using the formula
              $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l}
              X_{a}$, where $X_a$ represents the genotype of single nucleotide
              polymorphism (SNP) $a$, and $w_{a}^{l}$ is its corresponding
              weight in the tissue-specific prediction model $l$. Furthermore,
              $\mathbf{t}_l$ indicates the standardized form of

              In this section, we outline the key aspects of the
              transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) methods relevant to
              our regression framework, detailed further in referenced articles.
              We denote $\mathbf{y}$ as the vector representing traits for $n$
              individuals, which is centered to obviate the need for an
              intercept. The predicted gene expression for each individual in
              tissue type $l$ is given by $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in
              \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$, where $X_a$ represents the
              genotype of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) $a$, and
              $w_{a}^{l}$ is its corresponding weight in the tissue-specific
              prediction model $l$. The standardized predicted expression,
              $\mathbf{t}_l$, is subsequently normalized to have a mean of zero
              and a standard deviation of one.

              S-PrediXcan [1] is a streamlined version of the PrediXcan method
              [2]. PrediXcan characterizes the trait as a linear function of
              gene expression in a specific tissue using the univariate model:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
              regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error
              terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of
              the association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for
              each gene-tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level
              data to implement this model. In contrast, S-PrediXcan estimates
              the PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics as per
              the following expression:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression
              in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of
              SNP $a$ from the GWAS. These transcriptome-wide association
              studies (TWAS) consistently utilize genotype variances and
              covariances estimated from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project
              (GTEx v8) [3] as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan provides
              insights into the tissue-specific direction of effects, such as
              whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene increases
              or decreases disease risk, which we have applied in our drug
              repurposing strategy (described subsequently).

              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
              gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan needs individual-level data to
              fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan
              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l

              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype
              variances and covariances are always estimated using the

              [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
              S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
              instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
              confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our
              drug repurposing approach (described below).

              In this equation, $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect
              size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the
              error terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. We assess the
              significance of the association by calculating the $z$-score,
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for
              each gene's tissue model $l$. Unlike PrediXcan, which requires
              individual-level data to fit this model, S-PrediXcan estimates the
              PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics as shown
              below:

              S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a streamlined
              version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait
              as a linear function of gene expression in a specific tissue. This
              relationship is described using the equation:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
              regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error
              terms with a variance of $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance
              of the gene-tissue association is determined by calculating the
              $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l /
              \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for each gene's tissue model $l$.
              While PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model,
              S-PrediXcan estimates the PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS
              summary statistics, as shown in the following expression:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression
              in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of
              SNP $a$ from the GWAS. These Transcriptome-Wide Association
              Studies (TWAS) methods consistently utilize genotype variances and
              covariances estimated from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project
              (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.
              S-PrediXcan provides insights into the tissue-specific direction
              of effects, such as whether higher or lower predicted gene
              expression is associated with increased or decreased disease risk.
              We integrate these $z$-scores into our drug repurposing strategy,
              detailed later in the manuscript.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining
              the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the
              following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity,
              reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
              formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original
              information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text,
              2) preserve technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3)
              ensure that equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and
              correctly defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations,
              and 5) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept
              exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are
              crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format
              "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;

              coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
              association is assessed by computing the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
              gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan needs individual-level data to
              fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan

              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype
              variances and covariances are always estimated using the

              S-PrediXcan (Dhindsa et al., 2018) serves as the summary-based
              counterpart to PrediXcan (Gamazon et al., 2015). PrediXcan
              quantifies the trait as a linear function of gene expression
              within a specific tissue using the model:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
              regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error
              terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of
              each gene-tissue association is determined by calculating the
              $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l /
              \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$. PrediXcan requires individual-level
              data to implement this model. Conversely, S-PrediXcan estimates
              the PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
              through the formula:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}

              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression

              directionality of effects, such as whether a higher or lower
              predicted expression of a gene is associated with increased or
              decreased disease risk. We utilized these $z$-scores in our drug
              repurposing strategy, which is detailed in the following section.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining
              the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the
              following paragraph from the Methods section.


              Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is
              the summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan
              models the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on
              a single tissue using the univariate model


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
              coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
              association is assessed by computing the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
              gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan needs individual-level data to
              fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan
              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype
              variances and covariances are always estimated using the
              Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
              [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
              S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
              instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
              confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our
              drug repurposing approach (described below).

              S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a simplified
              version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait
              using a linear function of gene expression in a specific tissue.
              The model is represented by the equation:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ indicates the estimated effect size or
              regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error
              terms with a variance of $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance
              of the gene-tissue association is determined by calculating the
              $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
              \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for each gene-tissue model $l$.
              While PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model,
              S-PrediXcan utilizes only GWAS summary statistics to approximate
              these $z$-scores, as shown by the equation:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              In this expression, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of
              SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene
              expression in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated
              effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. These transcriptome-wide
              association studies (TWAS) always estimate genotype variances and
              covariances using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
              [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan
              provides insights into the direction of effects specific to
              tissues, indicating whether higher or lower predicted gene
              expression alters disease risk. This information is crucial in our
              drug repurposing strategies, as detailed later in the manuscript.

              from PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a
              linear function of gene expression in a single tissue using the
              following univariate model:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\gamma_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
              regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error
              terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of
              the association is determined by calculating the $z$-score,
              $\hat{z}_{l} =
              \frac{\hat{\gamma}_l}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)}$, for each
              gene's tissue-specific model $l$. PrediXcan requires
              individual-level data to fit this model; however, S-PrediXcan
              utilizes GWAS summary statistics to approximate these $z$-scores
              as follows:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression
              in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of
              SNP $a$ from the GWAS. These Transcriptome-Wide Association Study
              (TWAS) methods consistently utilize genotype variances and
              covariances estimated from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project
              (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.
              S-PrediXcan provides insights into the tissue-specific direction
              of effects, indicating whether a higher or lower predicted gene
              expression is associated with increased or decreased disease risk.
              These $z$-scores are integral to our drug repurposing strategy, as
              detailed in the subsequent section.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining
              the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the
              following paragraph from the Methods section.


              Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is
              the summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan
              models the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on
              a single tissue using the univariate model


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
              coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
              association is assessed by computing the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
              gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan needs individual-level data to
              fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan
              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype
              variances and covariances are always estimated using the
              Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
              [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
              S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
              instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
              confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our
              drug repurposing approach (described below).

              S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] represents a
              summary-based adaptation of the PrediXcan methodology
              [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a linear function
              of gene expression in a specific tissue via a univariate model:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              In this equation, $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect
              size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents
              the error terms, with a variance denoted by
              $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of each gene-tissue
              association is determined by calculating the $z$-score,
              $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for
              tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to
              implement this model, whereas S-PrediXcan can approximate these
              $z$-scores using solely GWAS summary statistics through the
              formula:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression
              in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of
              SNP $a$ from the GWAS. These transcriptome-wide association study
              (TWAS) methods consistently use the Genotype-Tissue Expression
              project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference
              panel for estimating genotype variances and covariances.
              S-PrediXcan provides insights into the tissue-specific direction
              of effects—indicating whether a higher or lower predicted
              expression of a gene is associated with increased or decreased
              disease risk—which is instrumental in our approach to drug
              repurposing, detailed subsequently.

              S-PrediXcan, as described in [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1], is
              a derivative method of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367] that
              simplifies the analysis by utilizing only GWAS summary statistics.
              PrediXcan quantifies the association between a trait and gene
              expression in a specific tissue through a linear model:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\gamma_l$ represents the estimated regression coefficient
              or effect size, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms with
              a variance of $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of this
              association is determined by calculating the $z$-score,
              $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for
              each gene-tissue model $l$. Unlike PrediXcan, which requires
              individual-level data to estimate these models, S-PrediXcan
              approximates the PrediXcan $z$-scores using the following
              expression:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ and $\hat{\sigma}_l$ are the variances of
              SNP $a$ and the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$,
              respectively, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of
              SNP $a$ from GWAS. These genotype variances and covariances are
              typically estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project
              (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference dataset.
              S-PrediXcan is particularly useful for determining the
              tissue-specific direction of gene expression effects on disease
              risk, an aspect we leverage in our drug repurposing strategy
              outlined below.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining
              the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the
              following paragraph from the Methods section.


              Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is
              the summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan
              models the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on
              a single tissue using the univariate model


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
              coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
              association is assessed by computing the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
              gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan needs individual-level data to
              fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan
              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype
              variances and covariances are always estimated using the
              Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)

              S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a streamlined
              version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait
              as a linear function of gene expression in a specific tissue using
              a univariate model:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              In this equation, $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect
              size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the
              error terms, which have a variance of $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The
              significance of the gene-tissue association is determined by
              calculating the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
              \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for each tissue-specific gene model
              $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to construct this
              model. Conversely, S-PrediXcan estimates the PrediXcan $z$-scores
              using only GWAS summary statistics with the following expression:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression
              in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of
              SNP $a$ from the GWAS. These Transcriptome-Wide Association Study
              (TWAS) methods consistently utilize genotype variances and
              covariances estimated from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project
              (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference.
              S-PrediXcan provides insights into the tissue-specific direction
              of effects, indicating whether higher or lower predicted gene
              expression modifies disease risk. This information is crucial for
              our drug repurposing strategy, detailed later in the manuscript.

            S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the summary version
            of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the trait as a
            linear function of the gene's expression on a single tissue using
            the univariate model


            $$

            \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

            $$ {#eq:predixcan}


            where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
            coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
            $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
            assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
            \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.
            PrediXcan needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas
            S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS
            summary statistics with the expression


            $$

            \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
            \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
            \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

            $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


            where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$
            is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$,
            and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the
            GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances
            are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project
            (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.
            Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
            instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
            confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our
            drug repurposing approach (described below).

              S-PrediXcan, as detailed by Barbeira et al. (2018) [DOI:
              10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1], serves as the summary data-based
              adaptation of PrediXcan, originally developed by Gamazon et al.
              (2015) [DOI: 10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan quantifies the
              association between a trait and gene expression in a specific
              tissue by modeling the trait as a linear function of gene
              expression using the equation:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\gamma_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
              regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error
              terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of
              each gene-tissue association is determined by calculating the
              $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l} =
              \frac{\hat{\gamma}_l}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)}$, for each
              gene's tissue-specific model $l$. PrediXcan requires
              individual-level data to estimate these parameters.


              Conversely, S-PrediXcan approximates the PrediXcan-derived
              $z$-scores using only genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary
              statistics. This approximation is expressed as:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ and $\hat{\beta}_a$ are the variance and
              estimated effect size of SNP $a$, respectively, and
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression
              in tissue $l$. The genotype variances and covariances required for
              these calculations are typically sourced from the Genotype-Tissue
              Expression project (GTEx v8) [DOI: 10.1126/science.aaz1776].


              S-PrediXcan's ability to provide tissue-specific directional
              effects (indicating whether higher or lower predicted gene
              expression alters disease risk) is particularly useful in contexts
              such as drug repurposing, which we explore further in the
              subsequent sections of this manuscript.

              S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] represents a
              condensed version of the PrediXcan methodology
              [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a linear function
              of gene expression within a single tissue using the following
              univariate model:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              In this equation, $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect
              size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents
              the error terms with a variance of $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The
              significance of each gene-tissue association is determined by
              calculating the $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
              \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for each tissue-specific gene model
              $l$. While PrediXcan requires individual-level data to establish
              this model, S-PrediXcan approximates the PrediXcan $z$-scores
              using only GWAS summary statistics, as described by the following
              expression:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression
              in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of
              SNP $a$ from the GWAS. These transcriptome-wide association study
              (TWAS) techniques consistently utilize the Genotype-Tissue
              Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the
              reference for estimating genotype variances and covariances.
              S-PrediXcan provides insights into the tissue-specific direction
              of effects, such as whether higher or lower predicted expression
              of a gene increases or decreases disease risk. These $z$-scores
              are integral to our strategy for drug repurposing, which is
              elaborated in the subsequent sections.

              S-PrediXcan, as detailed in [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1],
              represents a summary-based adaptation of the PrediXcan method,
              which is originally described in [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan
              models a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a
              specific tissue using the following univariate model:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\mathbf{t}_l$ denotes the predicted gene expression in
              tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
              coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
              association is determined by calculating the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for
              each gene's tissue model $l$. While PrediXcan requires
              individual-level data to fit this model, S-PrediXcan utilizes only
              GWAS summary statistics to approximate these $z$-scores, as given
              by the equation:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression
              in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of
              SNP $a$ from the GWAS. These transcriptome-wide association study
              (TWAS) methods consistently utilize genotype variances and
              covariances estimated from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project
              (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.
              S-PrediXcan provides insights into the tissue-specific
              directionality of effects, such as whether higher or lower
              predicted gene expression is associated with increased or
              decreased disease risk, which we have employed in our drug
              repurposing strategy (described subsequently).

              $l$, respectively, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$. The variance and covariance of genotypes used in
              these transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) are estimated
              using data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
              [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference. S-PrediXcan
              offers insight into the tissue-specific direction of gene
              expression effects on disease risk, which is instrumental in our
              drug repurposing strategies described later.

              reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
              formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original

              correctly defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations,
              and 5) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept
              exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are

              Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is
              the summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan
              models the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on
              a single tissue using the univariate model


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
              $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient,
              and $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
              $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
              assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
              \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.
              PrediXcan needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas
              S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS
              summary statistics with the expression


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype
              variances and covariances are always estimated using the
              Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
              [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
              S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
              instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
              confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our
              drug repurposing approach (described below).

              S-PrediXcan [1] represents a summary-based adaptation of the
              PrediXcan framework [2]. PrediXcan quantifies the relationship
              between a trait and gene expression in a specific tissue by
              employing a linear model:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\mathbf{t}_l$ denotes the predicted gene expression in
              tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
              coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with
              a variance of $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
              association is determined by calculating the $z$-score,
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for
              each gene-tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level
              data to construct this model. In contrast, S-PrediXcan estimates
              the PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics, as
              per the following formula:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ signifies the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression
              in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ represents the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. These transcriptome-wide
              association study (TWAS) methods consistently utilize genotype
              variances and covariances estimated from the Genotype-Tissue
              Expression project (GTEx v8) [3] as the reference panel.
              S-PrediXcan offers insights into the tissue-specific
              directionality of gene expression effects, such as whether
              increased or decreased predicted expression of a gene is
              associated with higher or lower disease risk. We leverage these
              $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy (described
              subsequently).

              $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for
              each tissue-specific gene model $l$. While PrediXcan requires

              S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] serves as a
              summary-based extension of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367].
              PrediXcan models a trait using a linear function of gene
              expression in a specific tissue, represented by the following
              univariate model:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\mathbf{t}_l$ denotes the predicted gene expression in
              tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
              coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
              gene-tissue association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for
              each tissue model $l$. While PrediXcan requires individual-level
              data to estimate these parameters, S-PrediXcan approximates these
              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics through the
              expression:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression
              in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of
              SNP $a$ from the GWAS. These transcriptome-wide association
              studies (TWAS) always use the genotype variances and covariances
              estimated from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
              [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan
              offers insights into the tissue-specific direction of effects,
              indicating whether higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
              increases or decreases disease risk. These $z$-scores are
              subsequently utilized in our drug repurposing methodology,
              detailed later in the text.

              S-PrediXcan (Barbeira et al., 2018) is a method derived from
              PrediXcan (Gamazon et al., 2015) that summarizes the latter's
              approach. PrediXcan quantifies the association between a trait and
              gene expression in a specific tissue by modeling the trait as a
              linear function of the predicted gene expression using the
              equation:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$


              where \(\mathbf{t}_l\) represents the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue \(l\), \(\gamma_l\) is the estimated effect size or
              regression coefficient, and \(\bm{\epsilon}_l\) denotes the error
              terms with variance \(\sigma_{\epsilon}^2\). The significance of
              the association is determined by calculating the \(z\)-score
              \(\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)\) for
              each gene's model in tissue \(l\). PrediXcan requires
              individual-level data to fit this model.


              In contrast, S-PrediXcan approximates the PrediXcan \(z\)-scores
              using only GWAS summary statistics through the following
              expression:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$


              where \(\hat{\sigma}_a\) is the variance of SNP \(a\),
              \(\hat{\sigma}_l\) is the variance of the predicted gene
              expression in tissue \(l\), and \(\hat{\beta}_a\) is the estimated
              effect size of SNP \(a\) from the GWAS. These Transcriptome-Wide
              Association Study (TWAS) methods consistently utilize genotype
              variances and covariances estimated from the Genotype-Tissue
              Expression project (GTEx v8) (Consortium, 2020) as the reference
              panel. S-PrediXcan provides insights into the tissue-specific
              directionality of effects, such as whether a higher or lower
              predicted expression of a gene increases or decreases disease
              risk. This capability was leveraged in our drug repurposing
              strategy, detailed subsequently.

              S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a streamlined
              version of the PrediXcan methodology [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which
              models a trait as a linear function of gene expression within a
              single tissue using the following univariate model:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              In this equation, $\mathbf{t}_l$ represents the predicted
              expression of a gene in tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated
              effect size or regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$
              denotes the error terms, which have a variance of
              $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the genetic
              association is determined by calculating the $z$-score,
              $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for
              each tissue-specific gene model $l$. While PrediXcan requires
              individual-level data to fit this model, S-PrediXcan can estimate
              PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics, as shown
              by the following approximation:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression
              in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of
              SNP $a$ from the GWAS. These transcriptome-wide association study
              (TWAS) methods consistently utilize genotype variances and
              covariances estimated by the Genotype-Tissue Expression project
              (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as their reference panel.
              S-PrediXcan provides insights into the tissue-specific direction
              of effects, such as whether higher or lower predicted expression
              of a gene increases or decreases disease risk. This information is
              crucial for our drug repurposing strategy (details discussed
              later).

              terms with variance \(\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}\). The significance of

              S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a streamlined
              version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait
              as a linear function of gene expression in a specific tissue using
              the following univariate model:


              $$

              coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
              gene-tissue association is determined by calculating the

              \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, for each tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
              requires individual-level data to construct this model. In
              contrast, S-PrediXcan estimates the PrediXcan $z$-scores using
              only GWAS summary statistics, as shown in the following
              expression:

              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression
              in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of
              SNP $a$ from the GWAS. These transcriptome-wide association study
              (TWAS) methods consistently utilize genotype variances and

              (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.
              S-PrediXcan provides insights into the tissue-specific direction

              S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a simplified
              version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], designed to predict
              the impact of gene expression on various traits. PrediXcan uses a

              specific tissue, represented by the equation:


              $$

              effect size, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
              gene-tissue association is quantified using the $z$-score,
              calculated as $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
              \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$.


              In contrast, S-PrediXcan approximates the PrediXcan $z$-scores
              using GWAS summary statistics through the following expression:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression for a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. Genotype variances and covariances
              are estimated using data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression
              project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference
              panel. S-PrediXcan provides insights into the tissue-specific
              direction of effects, which is pivotal for understanding whether
              variations in gene expression increase or decrease disease risk.
              This methodology was utilized in our drug repurposing strategy, as
              described in subsequent sections.

              and $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance

              S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] represents a

              [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a linear function

              coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms,
              which have a variance denoted by $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The

              S-PrediXcan [1] is a streamlined version of PrediXcan [2].
              PrediXcan quantifies a trait as a linear function of gene
              expression in a single tissue using a univariate model:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l},

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
              regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error
              terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of
              the association is determined by calculating the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for
              each gene-tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level
              data to establish this model. In contrast, S-PrediXcan
              approximates the PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
              statistics as follows:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}

              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression
              in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of
              SNP $a$ from the GWAS. These transcriptome-wide association study
              (TWAS) methods consistently utilize the Genotype-Tissue Expression
              project (GTEx v8) [3] as the reference panel for estimating
              genotype variances and covariances. Since S-PrediXcan provides
              tissue-specific insights into the direction of effects (e.g.,
              whether higher or lower predicted gene expression is associated
              with increased or decreased disease risk), it was utilized in our
              drug repurposing strategy, as detailed below.

            S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the summary version
            of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the trait as a
            linear function of the gene's expression on a single tissue using
            the univariate model


            $$

            $$ {#eq:predixcan}


            where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
            coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
            $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
            assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
            \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.
            PrediXcan needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas
            S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS
            summary statistics with the expression


            $$

            \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
            \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}

            and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the

            are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project
            (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.

              S-PrediXcan is a derivative method of PrediXcan, which models a

              tissue using a univariate model:


              $$

              regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error
              terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of
              the association is determined by calculating the $z$-score,
              $\hat{z}_{l} =
              \frac{\hat{\gamma}_l}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)}$, for each
              gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data
              to fit this model. Conversely, S-PrediXcan estimates the PrediXcan
              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics through the
              following approximation:


              $$

              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression
              in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of
              SNP $a$ from the GWAS. These Transcriptome-Wide Association Study
              (TWAS) methods consistently utilize genotype variances and
              covariances estimated from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project
              (GTEx v8) as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan provides insights
              into the tissue-specific direction of effects, indicating whether
              variations in predicted gene expression increase or decrease
              disease risk. These $z$-scores are integral to our drug
              repurposing strategy, detailed subsequently.

              S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a simplified
              version of the PrediXcan method [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which
              models a trait as a linear function of gene expression in a
              specific tissue. This is represented by the univariate model:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\gamma_l$ is the estimated regression coefficient or effect
              size, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the genetic
              association is determined by calculating the $z$-score,
              $\hat{z}_{l} =
              \frac{\hat{\gamma}_l}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)}$, for each
              tissue-specific gene model $l$. PrediXcan requires
              individual-level data to estimate this model. In contrast,
              S-PrediXcan estimates the PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS
              summary statistics, as shown by the equation:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ and $\hat{\sigma}_l$ are the variances of
              SNP $a$ and the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$,
              respectively, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of
              SNP $a$ from the GWAS. These Transcriptome-Wide Association Study
              (TWAS) methods consistently use the Genotype-Tissue Expression
              project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference
              panel for estimating genotype variances and covariances.
              S-PrediXcan provides insights into the tissue-specific direction
              of effects, such as whether an increase or decrease in predicted
              gene expression is associated with higher or lower disease risk.
              We leverage these $z$-scores in our strategy for drug repurposing,
              detailed later in the manuscript.

              S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a summary-based
              adaptation of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a
              trait as a linear function of gene expression in a specific
              tissue. This is described by the univariate model:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l},

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
              regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error
              terms with a variance of $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. To evaluate the
              significance of the association, a $z$-score, $\hat{z}_{l} =
              \hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$, is calculated for
              each gene's tissue-specific model $l$. PrediXcan requires
              individual-level data to implement this model. In contrast,
              S-PrediXcan estimates the PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS
              summary statistics, as shown in the expression:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression
              in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of
              SNP $a$ from the GWAS. The variance and covariance of genotypes in
              these transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) are
              consistently estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression
              project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference
              panel. S-PrediXcan provides insights into the tissue-specific
              direction of effects, such as whether a higher or lower predicted
              expression of a gene increases or decreases disease risk, which we
              utilize in our drug repurposing strategy (described later).

              interest as a linear function of gene expression in a specific

              each gene's expression model in tissue $l$. While PrediXcan

              estimates the PrediXcan $z$-scores using GWAS summary statistics

              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ and $\hat{\beta}_a$ are the variance and
              estimated effect size of SNP $a$, respectively, and
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression
              in tissue $l$. Both TWAS methods, PrediXcan and S-PrediXcan, rely

              lower predicted gene expression is associated with increased or

              direction of effects, indicating whether a higher or lower
              predicted expression of a gene increases or decreases disease
              risk. This information is crucial for our drug repurposing
              efforts, as detailed later in the manuscript.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining
              the text of a scientific manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic

              etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise
              the following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance
              clarity, reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to
              Markdown formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the
              original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to
              the text, 2) preserve technical details such as mathematical
              expressions, 3) ensure that equations (which could be numbered)
              are preserved and correctly defined, 4) preserve references to
              numbered equations, and 5) ensure most references to scientific
              articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text;
              these references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear
              with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;

              Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is
              the summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan
              models the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on
              a single tissue using the univariate model


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
              coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
              association is assessed by computing the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
              gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan needs individual-level data to
              fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan
              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype
              variances and covariances are always estimated using the
              Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
              [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
              S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
              instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
              confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our
              drug repurposing approach (described below).

              S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a streamlined
              version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait
              as a linear function of gene expression in a single tissue based
              on a univariate model:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
              regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error
              terms with a variance of $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance
              of the association is determined by calculating the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l} = \hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for
              each gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level
              data to establish this model. In contrast, S-PrediXcan estimates
              the PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
              through the expression:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression
              in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of
              SNP $a$ from the GWAS. These transcriptome-wide association study
              (TWAS) methods consistently utilize genotype variances and
              covariances estimated from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project
              (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.
              Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific directional effects
              (indicating whether higher or lower predicted gene expression
              increases or decreases disease risk), we incorporated these
              $z$-scores into our drug repurposing strategy (described
              subsequently).
