          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: Here we briefly provide the details about these TWAS
          methods that are necessary to explain our regression framework later
          (see the referenced articles for more information). In the following,
          we refer to $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of traits for $n$ individuals
          that is centered for convenience (so that no intercept is necessary);
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$
          is the gene's predicted expression for all individuals in tissue $l$,
          $X_a$ is the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ its weight in the tissue
          prediction model $l$; and $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the standardized version
          of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ with mean equal to zero and standard
          deviation equal to one.

          Here, we provide a brief overview of the TWAS methods necessary to
          elucidate our regression framework in subsequent sections (refer to
          the cited articles for more detailed information). In our notation,
          $\mathbf{y}$ represents a vector of traits for $n$ individuals, which
          has been centered for ease of interpretation (eliminating the need for
          an intercept term). The variable $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ denotes the
          predicted gene expression for all individuals in tissue $l$,
          calculated as the sum of the product of weights $w_{a}^{l}$ and
          genotypes $X_{a}$ for SNPs $a$ included in model $l$. Here, $X_a$
          represents the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ signifies its weight in
          tissue prediction model $l$. Additionally, $\mathbf{t}_l$ refers to
          the standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, with a mean of
          zero and a standard deviation of one.

          In this section, we outline the TWAS methods essential for
          understanding our regression framework (refer to the cited articles
          for more detailed information). Throughout the text, $\mathbf{y}$
          represents a vector of traits for $n$ individuals, which has been
          centered for ease of analysis (eliminating the need for an intercept).
          The predicted gene expression for all individuals in tissue $l$,
          denoted as $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, is calculated as the sum of the
          weights $w_{a}^{l}$ multiplied by the genotype $X_{a}$ for each SNP
          $a$ in the model $\mathrm{model}_l$. Here, $w_{a}$ signifies the
          weight of SNP $a$ in the tissue prediction model $l$, and
          $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$
          with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

          gene for all individuals in tissue $l$, denoted as
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, is calculated as the sum of the products of
          the weights $w_{a}^{l}$ and genotypes $X_{a}$ for each SNP $a$ in the
          model $\mathrm{model}_l$. Here, $X_a$ represents the genotype of SNP

          of interpretation (eliminating the need for an intercept). The
          expression $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l}
          w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$ denotes the predicted gene expression of the gene in
          tissue $l$ for all individuals, where $X_a$ corresponds to the
          genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ is the weight of SNP $a$ in tissue
          prediction model $l$. Additionally, $\mathbf{t}_l$ denotes the
          standardized form of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, with a mean of zero and a
          standard deviation of one.

          Here we provide a brief overview of the TWAS methods essential for
          understanding our regression framework (for more details, refer to the
          cited articles). In our notation, $\mathbf{y}$ represents a vector of
          traits for $n$ individuals, which has been centered for convenience
          (eliminating the need for an intercept). The predicted gene expression
          for all individuals in tissue $l$, denoted as $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$,
          is calculated as the sum of the products of weights $w_{a}^{l}$ and
          genotypes $X_{a}$ for SNPs $a$ in the model $\mathrm{model}_l$. Here,
          $w_{a}$ represents the weight of SNP $a$ in the tissue prediction
          model $l$, and $X_a$ is the genotype of the SNP. Additionally,
          $\mathbf{t}_l$ denotes the standardized version of
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, with a mean of zero and a standard deviation
          of one.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon,
          maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your
          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
          and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: Here we briefly provide the details about these TWAS
          methods that are necessary to explain our regression framework later
          (see the referenced articles for more information). In the following,
          we refer to $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of traits for $n$ individuals
          that is centered for convenience (so that no intercept is necessary);
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$
          is the gene's predicted expression for all individuals in tissue $l$,
          $X_a$ is the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ its weight in the tissue
          prediction model $l$; and $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the standardized version
          of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ with mean equal to zero and standard
          deviation equal to one.

          Here we provide a brief description of the TWAS methods essential for
          understanding our regression framework in subsequent sections. In this
          context, $\mathbf{y}$ represents a vector of traits for $n$
          individuals, which has been centered for convenience to eliminate the
          need for an intercept. The predicted gene expression
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ for all individuals in tissue $l$ is calculated
          as $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l}
          X_{a}$, where $X_a$ denotes the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ is the
          weight of SNP $a$ in tissue prediction model $l$. Additionally,
          $\mathbf{t}_l$ represents the standardized version of
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, with a mean of zero and a standard deviation
          of one. For more detailed information, please refer to the relevant
          articles cited in the references section.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the

          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          text of a scientific manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
          formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information
          as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve
          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly
          defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure
          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear
          in the original text; these references are crucial for academic
          integrity and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as
          "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan. PrediXcan represents
          a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue
          using the univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association
          is determined by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l
          / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.
          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, whereas
          S-PrediXcan estimates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics with the following expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene
          in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP
          $a$ from the GWAS. In these Transcriptome-Wide Association Study
          (TWAS) methods, the genotype variances and covariances are estimated
          using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the
          reference panel. As S-PrediXcan provides information on the
          tissue-specific direction of effects (e.g., whether higher or lower
          predicted gene expression increases or decreases disease risk), we
          utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy (as detailed
          below).

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a condensed version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the trait as a
          linear function of the gene's expression in a single tissue using a
          univariate model described by the equation:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms
          with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
          association is determined by calculating the $z$-score
          $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
          gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to
          fit this model, while S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores
          using only GWAS summary statistics with the following expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene
          in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP
          $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and
          covariances are estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project

          or less disease risk, we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug

          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression in
          tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP
          $a$ from the GWAS. In these Transcriptome-Wide Association Study
          (TWAS) methods, the genotype variances and covariances are estimated
          using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the
          reference panel [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776]. Since S-PrediXcan
          provides tissue-specific direction of effects (e.g., whether higher or
          lower predicted gene expression is associated with increased disease
          risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy
          (explained below).

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a condensed version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a linear
          function of a gene's expression in a single tissue using the
          univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          Here, $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms
          with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
          association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score
          $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
          gene's tissue model $l$. While PrediXcan requires individual-level
          data to fit this model, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores

          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression in
          tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP

          S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan. PrediXcan represents

          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association
          is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l
          / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.
          PrediXcan requires individual-level data for model fitting, while

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon,
          maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your
          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
          and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan. PrediXcan represents
          a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue
          using the univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association
          is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l
          / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.
          PrediXcan requires individual-level data for model fitting, whereas
          S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics with the formula:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene
          in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP
          $a$ from the GWAS. In these Transcriptome-Wide Association Study
          (TWAS) methods, the genotype variances and covariances are estimated
          using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the
          reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction
          of effects (e.g., whether higher or lower predicted gene expression is
          associated with increased disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in
          our drug repurposing strategy (explained below).

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
          formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information
          as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve
          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly
          defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure
          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear
          in the original text; these references are crucial for academic
          integrity and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as
          "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan is a condensed version of PrediXcan. PrediXcan represents
          a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue
          using a univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with a
          variance of $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
          association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score
          $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for the
          gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan necessitates individual-level data
          for model fitting, while S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores
          using only GWAS summary statistics with the following expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ signifies the variance of the predicted gene
          expression in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ denotes the estimated
          effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these Transcriptome-Wide
          Association Study (TWAS) methods, the genotype variances and
          covariances are estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project
          (GTEx v8) as the reference panel. As S-PrediXcan offers
          tissue-specific direction of effects (e.g., whether higher or lower
          predicted gene expression correlates with increased or decreased
          disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing
          strategy as detailed below.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a condensed version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a linear
          function of a gene's expression in a single tissue using the
          univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms
          with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
          association is determined by calculating the $z$-score
          $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
          gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to
          fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores
          using only GWAS summary statistics with the formula:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene
          in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP
          $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and
          covariances are estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project

          whether higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or

          strategy (detailed below).

          S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan. PrediXcan represents
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression in a single
          tissue using the univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association
          is determined by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l
          / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for the gene's tissue model $l$.
          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, while
          S-PrediXcan estimates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics with the formula:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) methods, the
          genotype variances and covariances are estimated using the
          Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel.
          As S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific directions of effects, we
          utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy (explained
          below) [1].

          S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan. PrediXcan represents
          a trait as a linear function of gene expression in a single tissue
          using the univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$,
          $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size (or regression coefficient),
          and $\epsilon_l$ represents the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          evaluated by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          requires individual-level data for model fitting, while S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) methods, the
          genotype variances and covariances are estimated using the
          Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel.
          Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (e.g.,
          whether higher or lower predicted gene expression increases or
          decreases disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing strategy (as detailed below).

          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
          formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information
          as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve
          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly
          defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure
          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear
          in the original text; these references are crucial for academic
          integrity and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as
          "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan. PrediXcan represents
          the trait as a linear function of gene expression in a single tissue
          using the univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$,
          $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          determined by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for the gene's tissue model $l$.
          PrediXcan requires individual-level data for model fitting, while
          S-PrediXcan estimates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics with the expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) methods, the
          genotype variances and covariances are estimated using the
          Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel.
          Since S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects
          (indicating whether higher or lower predicted gene expression is
          associated with increased disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in
          our drug repurposing strategy (explained in detail below).

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a condensed version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models a trait as a
          linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue using the
          univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ represents the predicted gene expression in
          tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ denotes the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          determined by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          requires individual-level data to fit this model, while S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the formula:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression in
          tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP
          $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and
          covariances are estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project

          whether higher or lower predicted gene expression is associated with
          increased or decreased disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in

          S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan. PrediXcan represents
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression in a single
          tissue using the univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l, 

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$,
          $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ represents the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          evaluated by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          requires individual-level data for model fitting, while S-PrediXcan
          estimates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with
          the equation:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)}, 

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ denotes the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ represents the variance of predicted gene expression
          in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP
          $a$ from the GWAS. In these Transcriptome-Wide Association Study
          (TWAS) methods, the genotype variances and covariances are estimated
          using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the
          reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of
          effects (e.g., whether higher or lower predicted gene expression
          correlates with increased or decreased disease risk), we utilized the
          $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy (explained below).

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon,
          maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your
          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
          and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan. PrediXcan represents
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression in a single
          tissue using the univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$,
          $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ represents the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          evaluated by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for the gene's tissue model $l$.
          PrediXcan requires individual-level data for model fitting, whereas
          S-PrediXcan estimates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics with the following expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) methods, the
          genotype variances and covariances are estimated using the
          Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel.
          Since S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects, such as
          whether higher or lower predicted gene expression is associated with
          increased or decreased disease risk, we utilized the $z$-scores in our
          drug repurposing strategy (explained in detail below) [1].

          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
          formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information
          as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve
          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly
          defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure
          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear
          in the original text; these references are crucial for academic
          integrity and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as
          "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan. PrediXcan represents
          a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue
          using the univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$,
          $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          determined by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          requires individual-level data for model fitting, whereas S-PrediXcan
          estimates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with
          the expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) methods, the
          genotype variances and covariances are estimated using the
          Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel.
          Since S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects
          (indicating whether higher or lower predicted gene expression
          contributes to increased or decreased disease risk), we utilized the
          $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy (as detailed below)

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the summary version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the trait as a
          linear function of the gene's expression on a single tissue using the
          univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a condensed version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models a trait as a
          linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue using the
          univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l},

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms
          with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
          association is determined by calculating the $z$-score
          $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for the
          gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to
          fit this model, while S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores
          using only GWAS summary statistics with the following expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene
          in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP
          $a$ from the GWAS. In these Transcriptome-Wide Association Study
          (TWAS) methods, the genotype variances and covariances are estimated
          using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)

          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (indicating
          whether higher or lower predicted gene expression is associated with
          increased disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug

          S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan. PrediXcan represents
          a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue
          using the univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association
          is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l
          / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.
          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, while
          S-PrediXcan estimates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics with the formula:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ signifies the variance of the predicted expression of
          a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ indicates the estimated

          disease risk, we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing

          / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.
          PrediXcan requires individual-level data for model fitting, while
          S-PrediXcan estimates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics with the following equation:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression in
          tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP
          $a$ from the GWAS. In these Transcriptome-Wide Association Study
          (TWAS) methods, the genotype variances and covariances are estimated
          using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the
          reference panel [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776]. As S-PrediXcan offers
          tissue-specific direction of effects (e.g., whether higher or lower
          predicted gene expression correlates with increased or decreased
          disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing
          strategy (explained below).

          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /

          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan

          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a condensed version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models a trait as a

          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon,
          maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your
          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
          and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan. PrediXcan models a
          trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single tissue
          using the univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms
          with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
          association is determined by calculating the $z$-score
          $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
          gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data to
          fit this model, while S-PrediXcan estimates PrediXcan $z$-scores using
          only GWAS summary statistics with the formula:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene
          in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP
          $a$ from the GWAS. In these Transcriptome-Wide Association Study
          (TWAS) methods, the genotype variances and covariances are estimated
          using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the
          reference panel. As S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of
          effects, such as whether a higher or lower predicted gene expression
          is associated with increased or decreased disease risk, we utilized
          the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy (explained in detail
          below).

          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx

          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan. PrediXcan represents
          the trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in a single
          tissue using the univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association
          is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l
          / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for the gene's tissue model $l$.
          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to construct this model,
          while S-PrediXcan estimates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS
          summary statistics with the following expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ denotes the variance of the predicted gene expression
          in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP
          $a$ from the GWAS. In these Transcriptome-Wide Association Study
          (TWAS) methods, the genotype variances and covariances are estimated
          using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the
          reference panel. As S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of
          effects (indicating whether higher or lower predicted gene expression
          is associated with increased disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores
          in our drug repurposing strategy, as detailed below.

          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity

          following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
          formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information
          as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve
          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly
          defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure
          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear
          in the original text; these references are crucial for academic
          integrity and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as
          "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan. PrediXcan predicts a
          trait based on the gene's expression in a single tissue using a linear
          model represented as:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l} + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association
          is determined by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l
          / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.
          PrediXcan requires individual-level data for model fitting, while
          S-PrediXcan estimates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics with the equation:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression in
          tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP
          $a$ from the GWAS. In these Transcriptome-Wide Association Study
          (TWAS) methods, the genotype variances and covariances are estimated
          using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the
          reference panel. Given that S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific
          direction of effects, we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing strategy, as detailed below.

          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l

          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a condensed version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait as a linear
          function of gene expression in a single tissue using the univariate
          model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l},

          $$


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error terms
          with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
          association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score
          $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
          gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data for
          model fitting, whereas S-PrediXcan estimates PrediXcan $z$-scores
          using only GWAS summary statistics with the following expression:

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression in
          tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP
          $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and

          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan

          The approach known as S-PrediXcan is a condensed version of PrediXcan.
          PrediXcan functions by representing a trait as a linear relationship
          with a gene's expression in a single tissue, employing a univariate
          model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          Here, $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association
          is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l
          / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.
          PrediXcan necessitates individual-level data for model fitting,
          whereas S-PrediXcan estimates PrediXcan $z$-scores solely based on
          GWAS summary statistics, given by:

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ signifies the variance of the predicted gene
          expression in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect

          risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy

          $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression in
          tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ denotes the estimated effect size of
          SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these Transcriptome-Wide Association Study
          (TWAS) methods, the genotype variances and covariances are estimated
          using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the
          reference panel. As S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of
          effects (indicating whether higher or lower predicted gene expression
          is associated with increased disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores
          in our drug repurposing strategy (explained in the subsequent
          section).

              Input paragraph: Here we briefly provide the details about these
              TWAS methods that are necessary to explain our regression
              framework later (see the referenced articles for more
              information). In the following, we refer to $\mathbf{y}$ as a
              vector of traits for $n$ individuals that is centered for
              convenience (so that no intercept is necessary);
              $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l}
              X_{a}$ is the gene's predicted expression for all individuals in
              tissue $l$, $X_a$ is the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ its
              weight in the tissue prediction model $l$; and $\mathbf{t}_l$ is
              the standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ with mean equal
              to zero and standard deviation equal to one.

              Here, $w_{a}$ signifies the weight of SNP $a$ in the tissue
              prediction model $l$, and $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the standardized

              Here we provide a brief overview of the TWAS methods essential for
              understanding our regression framework in subsequent sections (for
              more detailed information, refer to the cited articles). In our

              individuals, which has been centered for convenience to eliminate
              the need for an intercept term. The predicted gene expression for
              all individuals in tissue $l$, denoted as $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$,
              is calculated as $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in
              \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$, where $X_a$ represents the
              genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ is the weight of SNP $a$ in tissue
              prediction model $l$. Additionally, $\mathbf{t}_l$ refers to the
              standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, with a mean of

              S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a condensed
              version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models a trait
              as a linear function of gene expression in a single tissue using
              the univariate model:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$


              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
              regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ denotes the error
              terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of
              the association is determined by calculating the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
              gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data
              for model fitting, while S-PrediXcan estimates PrediXcan
              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the formula:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$


              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression
              in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of
              SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype
              variances and covariances are estimated using the Genotype-Tissue
              Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the
              reference panel. As S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction
              of effects (indicating whether higher or lower predicted gene
              expression is associated with increased or decreased disease
              risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy
              (detailed below).

              S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan. PrediXcan
              represents a trait as a linear function of gene expression in a
              single tissue using the univariate model:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$


              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or
              regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error
              terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of
              the association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
              gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data
              for model fitting, while S-PrediXcan estimates PrediXcan
              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$


              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression
              in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of
              SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these Transcriptome-Wide Association
              Study (TWAS) methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
              estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
              as the reference panel [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776]. Since
              S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects (e.g.,
              indicating whether higher or lower predicted gene expression is
              associated with increased disease risk), we utilized the
              $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy (outlined below).

              S-PrediXcan is a condensed version of PrediXcan. PrediXcan
              represents a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in
              a single tissue using a univariate model:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$


              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or
              regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error
              terms with a variance of $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance
              of the association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for the
              gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan necessitates individual-level
              data for model fitting, while S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan
              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the following

              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ signifies the variance of the predicted gene
              expression in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ denotes the
              estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these
              Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) methods, the genotype
              variances and covariances are estimated using the Genotype-Tissue
              Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel. As

              whether higher or lower predicted gene expression correlates with
              increased or decreased disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores

              S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a condensed
              version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan utilizes a
              univariate model that represents the trait as a linear function of
              the gene's expression in a single tissue:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              Here, $\mathbf{t}_l$ represents the predicted gene expression in
              tissue $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
              coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ denotes the error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
              association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for the
              gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data
              for model fitting, while S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan
              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the following
              expression:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              Here, $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression
              in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of
              SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype
              variances and covariances are estimated using the Genotype-Tissue
              Expression project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the
              reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific
              direction of effects (indicating whether higher or lower predicted
              gene expression is associated with increased or decreased disease
              risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy
              (explained below).

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining
              the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the

              the summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan
              models the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on
              a single tissue using the univariate model


              $$

              $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient,
              and $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
              $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
              assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
              \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.
              PrediXcan needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas
              S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS
              summary statistics with the expression

              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype
              variances and covariances are always estimated using the
              Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
              [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
              S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
              instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
              confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our
              drug repurposing approach (described below).

              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of predicted gene expression in
              tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of

            the univariate model

            $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient,
            and $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
            $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
            assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
            \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.
            PrediXcan needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas

            summary statistics with the expression

              S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan. PrediXcan
              represents the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression
              in a single tissue using the univariate model:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l, 

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the predicted gene expression in tissue
              $l$, $\gamma_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
              coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ represents the error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
              association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for
              gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data
              for model fitting, while S-PrediXcan estimates PrediXcan
              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the equation:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)}, 

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ denotes the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ represents the variance of predicted gene
              expression in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated
              effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these Transcriptome-Wide
              Association Study (TWAS) methods, the genotype variances and
              covariances are estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression
              project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel. Since S-PrediXcan offers
              tissue-specific direction of effects (e.g., whether higher or
              lower predicted gene expression correlates with increased or
              decreased disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our drug
              repurposing strategy (explained below).

              the text, 2) preserve technical details such as mathematical
              expressions, 3) ensure that equations (which could be numbered)

              the summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan
              models the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on
              a single tissue using the univariate model

              $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient,
              and $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
              $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
              assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
              \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.
              PrediXcan needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas
              S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS
              summary statistics with the expression

              S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan. PrediXcan
              represents the trait as a linear function of a gene's expression

              coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ represents the error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
              association is determined by calculating the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for the
              gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data
              for model fitting, whereas S-PrediXcan estimates PrediXcan
              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the formula:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l

              Here, $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression
              in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of
              SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these Transcriptome-Wide Association
              Studies (TWAS) methods, the genotype variances and covariances are

              S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan. PrediXcan
              represents a trait as a linear function of a gene's expression in
              a single tissue using the univariate model:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or
              regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error
              terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of
              the association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
              gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data
              to fit this model, while S-PrediXcan estimates PrediXcan
              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the formula:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ signifies the variance of the predicted
              expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ indicates
              the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these
              Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) methods, the genotype
              variances and covariances are estimated using the Genotype-Tissue
              Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel. As
              S-PrediXcan offers tissue-specific direction of effects, such as
              whether a higher or lower predicted gene expression correlates
              with increased or decreased disease risk, we utilized the
              $z$-scores in our drug repurposing strategy as detailed below.

              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a

              S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a condensed
              version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan employs a
              univariate model that represents a trait as a linear function of a
              gene's expression in a single tissue:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l} \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ denotes the estimated effect size or
              regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ represents the error
              terms with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of
              the association is evaluated by calculating the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
              gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires individual-level data
              to construct this model, whereas S-PrediXcan estimates PrediXcan
              $z$-scores utilizing only GWAS summary statistics with the
              following expression:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ denotes the variance of the predicted expression
              of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated
              effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these Transcriptome-Wide
              Association Study (TWAS) methods, the genotype variances and
              covariances are estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression
              project (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference
              panel. As S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of
              effects (e.g., whether higher or lower predicted gene expression
              confers greater disease risk), we utilized the $z$-scores in our
              drug repurposing strategy (explained below).

              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a

            S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the summary version
            of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the trait as a
            linear function of the gene's expression on a single tissue using
            the univariate model


            $$

            \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

            $$ {#eq:predixcan}


            where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
            coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
            $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
            assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
            \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.
            PrediXcan needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas
            S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS
            summary statistics with the expression


            $$

            \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
            \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
            \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

            $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


            where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$
            is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$,
            and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the
            GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances
            are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project
            (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.
            Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
            instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
            confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our

              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted gene expression
              in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of

              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
              gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan needs individual-level data to
              fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan
              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype
              variances and covariances are always estimated using the
              Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
              [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
              S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
              instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
              confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our
              drug repurposing approach (described below).

            S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the summary version
            of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the trait as a
            linear function of the gene's expression on a single tissue using
            the univariate model


            $$

            \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

            $$ {#eq:predixcan}


            where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
            coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
            $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
            assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
            \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.

            where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$
            is the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$,
            and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the
