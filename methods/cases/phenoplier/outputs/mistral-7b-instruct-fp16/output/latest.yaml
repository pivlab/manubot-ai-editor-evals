          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: Here we briefly provide the details about these TWAS
          methods that are necessary to explain our regression framework later
          (see the referenced articles for more information). In the following,
          we refer to $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of traits for $n$ individuals
          that is centered for convenience (so that no intercept is necessary);
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$
          is the gene's predicted expression for all individuals in tissue $l$,
          $X_a$ is the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ its weight in the tissue
          prediction model $l$; and $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the standardized version
          of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ with mean equal to zero and standard
          deviation equal to one.

          In this section, we briefly describe the TWAS methods that will be
          utilized later in our regression framework (as detailed in referenced
          articles). For convenience, we refer to $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of
          traits for $n$ individuals, centered so that no intercept is required.
          The predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, denoted as
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, is calculated by summing the weighted
          genotypes of all SNPs in the model $l$, where $X_a$ represents the
          genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ is its corresponding weight in the
          tissue prediction model $l$. The standardized version of
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, denoted as $\mathbf{t}_l$, has a mean of zero
          and a standard deviation of one.

          is its weight in the tissue prediction model $l$. Finally, we

          \bar{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l}}{\sigma_{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l}}$ as the
          standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ with mean equal to zero
          and standard deviation equal to one.

          In this section, we briefly introduce the TWAS methods that will be
          used to describe our regression framework in more detail (see the
          referenced articles for further information). For clarity, we use
          $\mathbf{y}$ to represent a vector of traits for $n$ individuals,
          centered for convenience so that no intercept is required. We define
          $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$
          as the predicted expression of the gene in tissue $l$, where $X_a$ is
          the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ its weight in the tissue
          prediction model $l$. Finally, we obtain $\mathbf{t}_l$ by
          standardizing $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ with a mean of zero and a
          standard deviation of one.


          Throughout this manuscript, we use mathematical expressions to
          describe technical details as much as possible while maintaining
          clarity. We ensure that all equations are properly defined and
          numbered where necessary. Additionally, we reference scientific
          articles using the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;

          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression

          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since

          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon,
          maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your
          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
          and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
          formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information
          as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve
          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly
          defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure
          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear
          in the original text; these references are crucial for academic
          integrity and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as
          "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367] is a method that models gene

          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.


          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a summary version of
          PrediXcan, which approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS
          summary statistics with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l

          PrediXcan and S-PrediXcan are two methods for modeling genetic
          associations with disease etiology and drug mechanisms. PrediXcan uses
          individual-level data to fit a linear model of the trait as a function
          of gene expression on a single tissue, using the univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.


          S-PrediXcan, on the other hand, approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores
          using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}

          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.

          the reference panel for estimating genotype variances and covariances.

          $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.


          S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan that approximates the
          $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics. The approximation
          expression {#eq:spredixcan} is used, where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents
          the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the
          predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is
          the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. The genotype
          variances and covariances are always estimated using the
          Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel.


          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects, which can
          be useful in drug repurposing approaches. In this study, we used
          S-PrediXcan $z$-scores to assess the potential of existing drugs for
          treating a particular disease.

          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model

          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics

          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are

          The S-PrediXcan method is an abridged version of PrediXcan, which
          models the trait as a linear function of gene expression in a single
          tissue using a univariate model. The model is expressed as:

          The S-PrediXcan method [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a summary
          version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. Both methods model the
          trait as a linear function of gene expression on a single tissue using
          different approaches.


          PrediXcan uses an univariate model to fit the trait as a linear
          function of the gene's expression on a single tissue, with error terms
          $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ and estimated effect size or regression coefficient
          $\hat{\gamma}_l$. The significance of the association is assessed by
          computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.


          S-PrediXcan, on the other hand, approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores
          using only GWAS summary statistics. The expression used is:


          $$

          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon,
          maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your
          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
          and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan is the summary version of PrediXcan, which models the
          trait as a linear function of gene expression on a single tissue using
          the univariate model. The equation for this model is:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.


          S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics. The expression for this approximation is:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are always
          estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as a
          reference panel.


          Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects, we
          used the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).


          Revised paragraph:
        display: >-

          The S-PrediXcan tool [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a simplified
          version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. While PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of gene expression on a single tissue
          using the univariate model described in equation #eq:predixcan,
          S-PrediXcan uses only GWAS summary statistics to approximate PrediXcan
          $z$-scores with the expression given in equation #eq:spredixcan. This
          approach is useful because it allows for the analysis of disease risk
          without requiring individual-level data.


          In these TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are always
          estimated using GTEx v8 as a reference panel
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776]. S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific
          direction of effects, which can be used to identify genes that may be
          repurposed for drug development (see below).


          Overall, the use of S-PrediXcan in our drug repurposing approach is a
          valuable tool for identifying potential therapeutic targets based on
          GWAS data and gene expression information.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
          formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information
          as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve
          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly
          defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure
          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear
          in the original text; these references are crucial for academic
          integrity and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as
          "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan, which models the
          relationship between a trait and gene expression in a single tissue
          using a univariate model. The linear equation for this model is:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
          regression coefficient and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. To determine the significance of the
          association, a $z$-score is computed for each gene's tissue model $l$:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} = \frac{\hat{\gamma}_l}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)}.

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          PrediXcan requires individual-level data to fit this model, while
          S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics. The expression for S-PrediXcan is:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)}.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan is a summary version of PrediXcan, an R package that

          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon,
          maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your
          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
          and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;

          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367] is a statistical model that predicts
          disease risk based on the expression of genes in a single tissue using
          univariate analysis. The model uses linear regression to estimate the
          effect size or regression coefficient for each gene, which is then
          used to calculate significance scores [#eq:predixcan].


          S-PrediXcan is an approximation of PrediXcan that utilizes GWAS
          summary statistics instead of individual-level data. This method
          calculates $z$-scores for each gene using the expression
          [#eq:spredixcan], which takes into account the variance of SNPs and
          their estimated effect sizes from the GWAS. The Genotype-Tissue
          Expression project (GTEx v8) is used to estimate genotype variances
          and covariances in these TWAS methods [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776].


          Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects, we
          utilized the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach.

          PrediXcan is a functional genomics tool for modeling traits as linear
          functions of gene expression on a single tissue. The univariate model
          uses the equation:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.


          S-PrediXcan is a summary version of PrediXcan that approximates the
          $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics. The expression is:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) as the reference panel.


          Our analysis used S-PrediXcan to identify genetic associations for
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms. We computed the $z$-scores for
          each gene in a tissue model, which provided tissue-specific direction
          of effects (for instance, whether a higher or lower predicted
          expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk). These
          $z$-scores were used in our drug repurposing approach to identify
          potential therapeutic targets and drug mechanisms.

          paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon,
          maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your
          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity

          following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
          formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information
          as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve
          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly
          defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure
          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear
          in the original text; these references are crucial for academic
          integrity and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as

          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367] is a computational tool that models
          the relationship between genetic variants and complex traits, such as
          disease risk. It uses gene expression data from a single tissue to
          predict the trait value for an individual based on their genotype. The
          model is defined by the linear equation:


          $$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,$$
          {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the predicted gene expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.


          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a simplified version
          of PrediXcan that uses only GWAS summary statistics to predict the
          trait value for an individual. It approximates the $z$-scores using
          the following equation:


          $$\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},$$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.

          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects, which can
          be useful in drug repurposing approaches. In our study, we used the
          $z$-scores to identify potential therapeutic targets and drug
          mechanisms for a specific disease.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).


          Revised paragraph:

          S-PrediXcan is a summary version of PrediXcan, which models the trait
          as a linear function of gene expression on a single tissue using the
          univariate model. The equation for this model is given in Eq. [1].
          S-PrediXcan uses GWAS summary statistics to approximate PrediXcan
          $z$-scores, with the expression being:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In S-PrediXcan, genotype variances and covariances are always
          estimated using GTEx v8 as the reference panel.


          One advantage of S-PrediXcan is that it provides tissue-specific
          direction of effects, such as whether a higher or lower predicted
          expression of a gene confers more or less disease risk. In our drug
          repurposing approach, we used the $z$-scores generated by S-PrediXcan
          to identify potential drug targets for a specific disease.

          S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan, which models the
          relationship between a trait and gene expression levels on a single
          tissue using a linear regression model. The equation for this model
          is:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the predicted expression of a gene in tissue
          $l$, $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient,
          and $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association between
          the trait and gene expression levels is assessed by computing the
          $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$
          for a gene's tissue model $l$.


          S-PrediXcan uses only GWAS summary statistics to approximate PrediXcan
          $z$-scores, rather than individual-level data. The equation for this
          approximation is:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          The genotype variances and covariances are always estimated using the
          Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel.


          One advantage of S-PrediXcan is that it provides tissue-specific
          direction of effects, which can be useful in drug repurposing
          approaches. In our study, we used these $z$-scores to identify
          potential therapeutic targets for a specific disease.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the

          The S-PrediXcan method is a summary version of PrediXcan
          [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models the trait as a linear function of
          gene expression on a single tissue using the univariate model, as

          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,

          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance

          S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics, as shown in Equation {#eq:spredixcan}:

          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          S-PrediXcan uses GTEx v8 [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as a reference
          panel to estimate genotype variances and covariances.


          One advantage of S-PrediXcan is that it provides tissue-specific
          direction of effects, allowing us to determine whether a higher or
          lower predicted expression of a gene confers more or less disease
          risk. In our drug repurposing approach, we used the $z$-scores to

          potential candidates for drug repurposing.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon,
          maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your
          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
          and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where \mathbf{t}_l is the gene predicted expression in tissue $l$,
          $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression coefficient, and
          $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan, which models a trait
          as a linear function of gene expression on a single tissue using a
          univariate model. The equation for the model is shown below:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\mathbf{t}_l$ represents the predicted expression of a gene in
          tissue $l$, $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ are error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.


          To fit this model, PrediXcan requires individual-level data. However,
          S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics. The expression for the approximation is shown below:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\Sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_l$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are always
          estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as
          the reference panel.


          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (e.g.,
          whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more
          or less disease risk), which we used in our drug repurposing approach
          (described below).

          following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
          formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information
          as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve
          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly
          defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure
          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear
          in the original text; these references are crucial for academic
          integrity and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as
          "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan, which is a tool that
          models genetic associations through gene expression patterns.
          S-PrediXcan uses the univariate model to predict disease risk based on
          the expression of a single tissue using the equation:


          $$y = t\_l \gamma\_l + \epsilon\_l,$$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.


          S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics with the expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w\_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx

          Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects, we
          used the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach. Our study
          highlights the importance of functional genomics and gene
          co-expression in identifying therapeutic targets and drug mechanisms
          for complex traits.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).


          Revised paragraph:

          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.


          S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics with the expression


          $$

          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.

          PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367] is a statistical method that models
          traits as linear functions of gene expression on a single tissue using
          the univariate model, which can be expressed mathematically as:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.


          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the summary version
          of PrediXcan, which approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS
          summary statistics with the expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are always
          estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.


          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects, which can
          be used in drug repurposing approaches. In our study, we used
          $z$-scores to identify potential drug targets for a specific disease.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section.


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug

          S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan
          [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which models the trait as a linear function of
          gene expression in a single tissue using the univariate model
          [#eq:predixcan]. This model estimates the effect size or regression
          coefficient $\hat{\gamma}_l$ and error terms $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ with
          variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$ for each gene's tissue model $l$. The
          significance of the association is determined by calculating the
          $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$
          for a given gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan requires
          individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          [#eq:spredixcan]. Specifically, S-PrediXcan uses the expression


          $$\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},$$


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          S-PrediXcan estimates genotype variances and covariances using GTEx v8
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. The use of
          S-PrediXcan allows for tissue-specific direction of effects (e.g.,
          whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more
          or less disease risk), which is useful in drug repurposing approaches
          (see below).

          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan

          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367] is a tool that models a trait as a
          linear function of gene expression on a single tissue using the
          univariate model defined in equation [#eq:predixcan]. The significance
          of the association is assessed by computing the $z$-score
          $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a

          S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is a simplified version
          of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the trait as a
          linear function of gene expression in a single tissue using the
          univariate model

          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}

          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          requires individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression

          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}

          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are always
          estimated using GTEx v8 [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the
          reference panel. S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of
          effects (e.g., whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a
          gene confers more or less disease risk), which we used in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon,
          maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown formatting. Your
          revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as
          possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve technical
          details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that equations
          (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly defined, 4)
          preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure most
          references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in
          the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
          and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;

          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan

          The summary version of PrediXcan, known as S-PrediXcan, is a tool that
          models traits as linear functions of gene expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model:


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.


          S-PrediXcan, on the other hand, approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores
          using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression:


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.

          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.


          One of the advantages of S-PrediXcan is that it provides
          tissue-specific direction of effects, which means we can determine
          whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene confers more
          or less disease risk in a specific tissue. We used these $z$-scores in
          our drug repurposing approach (which is described below).

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Methods section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, maintain a scholarly tone, and adhere to Markdown
          formatting. Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information
          as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) preserve
          technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3) ensure that
          equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and correctly
          defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations, and 5) ensure
          most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear
          in the original text; these references are crucial for academic
          integrity and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as
          "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


          Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is the
          summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models
          the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on a single
          tissue using the univariate model


          $$

          \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

          $$ {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan
          needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan
          approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics
          with the expression


          $$

          \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

          $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.
          In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances are
          always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
          v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
          S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
          instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
          confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our drug
          repurposing approach (described below).

          S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan, which models the
          trait as a linear function of gene expression on a single tissue using
          the univariate model:


          $$\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t\_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,}$$
          {#eq:predixcan}


          where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
          coefficient and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
          $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
          assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
          \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.


          S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS summary
          statistics with the expression:


          $$\hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
          \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
          \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},$$ {#eq:spredixcan}


          where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$, $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is
          the variance of the predicted expression of a gene in tissue $l$, and
          $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS.

              a vector of traits for $n$ individuals, centered so that no
              intercept is required. The predicted expression of a gene in
              tissue $l$, denoted as $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, is calculated by
              summing the weighted genotypes of all SNPs in the model $l$, where
              $X_a$ represents the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ is its
              corresponding weight in the tissue prediction model $l$. The
              standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, denoted as
              $\mathbf{t}_l$, has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of
              one.

              In this section, we provide a brief overview of the TWAS methods
              used in our study. These techniques are essential for explaining
              our regression framework, as detailed in the referenced articles.
              For convenience, we denote $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of traits for
              $n$ individuals, which is centered so that no intercept is
              necessary. We define $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in
              \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$ as the gene's predicted
              expression for all individuals in tissue $l$, where $X_a$
              represents the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ is its weight in
              the tissue prediction model $l$. Finally, we calculate
              $\mathbf{t}_l = \frac{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l -
              \bar{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l}}{\sigma_{\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l}}$ as the
              standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ with mean equal to
              zero and standard deviation equal to one.

              In this section, we briefly introduce the TWAS methods that will
              be used to describe our regression framework in more detail (see
              the referenced articles for further information). For clarity, we

              individuals, centered for convenience so that no intercept is

              a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

              In this section, we briefly introduce the TWAS methods used in our
              study. These techniques are crucial for understanding the
              regression framework presented later (referenced articles provide
              additional information). We refer to $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of
              traits for $n$ individuals, centered for convenience (no intercept
              is necessary); $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in
              \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$ denotes the gene's predicted
              expression for all individuals in tissue $l$, where $X_a$
              represents the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ is its weight in
              the tissue prediction model $l$. Finally, $\mathbf{t}_l$ refers to
              the standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$, with a mean of
              zero and a standard deviation of one.

              The S-PrediXcan method is a summary version of PrediXcan, which
              models a trait as a linear function of gene expression on a single
              tissue using the univariate model. The significance of the
              association between the trait and a gene's expression is assessed
              by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
              \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.
              However, S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only
              GWAS summary statistics. The genotype variances and covariances
              are estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx
              v8) as the reference panel. S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific
              direction of effects, which can be used in drug repurposing
              approaches.

              coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
              association is assessed by computing the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
              gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan needs individual-level data to
              fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan
              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype
              variances and covariances are always estimated using the
              Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
              [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
              S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
              instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
              confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our
              drug repurposing approach (described below).

              The S-PrediXcan method is a simplified version of PrediXcan, which

              PrediXcan and S-PrediXcan are two methods for modeling genetic
              associations with disease etiology and drug mechanisms. PrediXcan
              uses individual-level data to fit a linear model of the trait as a
              function of gene expression on a single tissue, using the
              univariate model:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
              coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
              association is assessed by computing the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
              gene's tissue model $l$.


              S-PrediXcan, on the other hand, approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores
              using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. S-PrediXcan uses the

              PrediXcan is a statistical tool that models traits as linear
              functions of gene expression levels on single tissues. The
              univariate model {#eq:predixcan} is used to fit the trait, where
              $\hat{\gamma}_l$ represents the estimated effect size or
              regression coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms
              with variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
              association is assessed by computing the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
              gene's tissue model $l$.


              S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan that approximates
              the $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics. The
              approximation expression {#eq:spredixcan} is used, where
              $\hat{\sigma}_a$ represents the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect

              covariances are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue
              Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference panel.


              S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects, which
              can be useful in drug repurposing approaches. In this study, we
              used S-PrediXcan $z$-scores to assess the potential of existing

            of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan models the trait as a
            linear function of the gene's expression on a single tissue using
            the univariate model


            $$

            where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
            coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with variance
            $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
            assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
            \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.
            PrediXcan needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas
            S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS
            summary statistics with the expression


            $$

            and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect size of SNP $a$ from the
            GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype variances and covariances
            are always estimated using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project
            (GTEx v8) [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel.
            Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
            instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene

              The S-PrediXcan method is an abridged version of PrediXcan, which
              models the trait as a linear function of gene expression in a
              single tissue using a univariate model. The model is expressed as:


              $$

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}

              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect

              single tissue using different approaches.


              PrediXcan uses an univariate model to fit the trait as a linear
              function of the gene's expression on a single tissue, with error
              terms $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ and estimated effect size or regression

              / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.


              S-PrediXcan, on the other hand, approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores
              using only GWAS summary statistics. The expression used is:


              $$

              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a

              simplified version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. While

              on a single tissue using the univariate model described in

              statistics to approximate PrediXcan $z$-scores with the expression
              given in equation #eq:spredixcan. This approach is useful because

              individual-level data.


              In these TWAS methods, genotype variances and covariances are

              identify genes that may be repurposed for drug development (see
              below).


              Overall, the use of S-PrediXcan in our drug repurposing approach
              is a valuable tool for identifying potential therapeutic targets
              based on GWAS data and gene expression information.

              and $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
              $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
              assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
              \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.
              PrediXcan needs individual-level data to fit this model, whereas
              S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS

              PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367] is a computational method that
              models the relationship between gene expression and disease risk.
              It uses linear regression to predict the disease trait based on
              the gene's expression in a single tissue. The equation for
              PrediXcan is as follows:


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t}_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where \mathbf{t}_l is the predicted expression of a gene in tissue
              $l$, $\beta_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
              coefficient, and $\epsilon_l$ are the error terms with variance
              $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the association is
              assessed by computing the $z$-score $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l /
              \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a gene's tissue model $l$.

              of PrediXcan that uses only GWAS summary statistics to approximate
              PrediXcan $z$-scores. The equation for S-PrediXcan is as follows:

              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the

              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
              gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan needs individual-level data to
              fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan

              S-PrediXcan is a simplified version of PrediXcan, which is a tool
              that models genetic associations through gene expression patterns.
              S-PrediXcan uses the univariate model to predict disease risk
              based on the expression of a single tissue using the equation:


              $$y = t\_l \gamma\_l + \epsilon\_l,$$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
              coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
              association is assessed by computing the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
              gene's tissue model $l$.


              S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan $z$-scores using only GWAS
              summary statistics with the expression:


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \approx \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w\_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype
              variances and covariances are always estimated using the
              Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8) as the reference
              panel.


              Since S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects,
              we used the $z$-scores in our drug repurposing approach. Our study
              highlights the importance of functional genomics and gene

              function of gene expression in a single tissue using the

              gene's tissue model $l$. The significance of the association is
              determined by calculating the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a

              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics [#eq:spredixcan].
              Specifically, S-PrediXcan uses the expression

              information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text,
              2) preserve technical details such as mathematical expressions, 3)
              ensure that equations (which could be numbered) are preserved and
              correctly defined, 4) preserve references to numbered equations,
              and 5) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept
              exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are
              crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format
              "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]".


              Input paragraph: S-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] is
              the summary version of PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. PrediXcan
              models the trait as a linear function of the gene's expression on
              a single tissue using the univariate model


              $$

              \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{t_l \gamma_l + \bm{\epsilon}_l,

              $$ {#eq:predixcan}


              where $\hat{\gamma}_l$ is the estimated effect size or regression
              coefficient, and $\bm{\epsilon}_l$ are the error terms with
              variance $\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}$. The significance of the
              association is assessed by computing the $z$-score
              $\hat{z}_{l}=\hat{\gamma}_l / \mathrm{se}(\hat{\gamma}_l)$ for a
              gene's tissue model $l$. PrediXcan needs individual-level data to
              fit this model, whereas S-PrediXcan approximates PrediXcan
              $z$-scores using only GWAS summary statistics with the expression


              $$

              \hat{z}_{l} \appro \sum_{a \in model_{l}} w_a^l
              \frac{\hat{\sigma}_a}{\hat{\sigma}_l}
              \frac{\hat{\beta}_a}{\mathrm{se}(\hat{\beta}_a)},

              $$ {#eq:spredixcan}


              where $\hat{\sigma}_a$ is the variance of SNP $a$,
              $\hat{\sigma}_l$ is the variance of the predicted expression of a
              gene in tissue $l$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ is the estimated effect
              size of SNP $a$ from the GWAS. In these TWAS methods, the genotype
              variances and covariances are always estimated using the
              Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx v8)
              [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776] as the reference panel. Since
              S-PrediXcan provides tissue-specific direction of effects (for
              instance, whether a higher or lower predicted expression of a gene
              confers more or less disease risk), we used the $z$-scores in our
              drug repurposing approach (described below).
