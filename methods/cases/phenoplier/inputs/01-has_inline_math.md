Here we briefly provide the details about these TWAS methods that are necessary to explain our regression framework later (see the referenced articles for more information). In the following, we refer to $\mathbf{y}$ as a vector of traits for $n$ individuals that is centered for convenience (so that no intercept is necessary); $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l = \sum_{a \in \mathrm{model}_l} w_{a}^{l} X_{a}$ is the gene's predicted expression for all individuals in tissue $l$, $X_a$ is the genotype of SNP $a$ and $w_{a}$ its weight in the tissue prediction model $l$; and $\mathbf{t}_l$ is the standardized version of $\tilde{\mathbf{t}}_l$ with mean equal to zero and standard deviation equal to one.
