Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. ""here we"") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. ""broader significance"").

Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. ""here we"") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. ""broader significance"").

Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. ""here we"") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. ""broader significance"").

Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. ""here we"") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. ""broader significance"").

The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. ""here we"") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. ""broader significance"").

Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. ""here we"") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. ""broader significance""). If any part of the C-C-C scheme is missing, put an HTML comment in the place where it belongs with its name, so I can fill it in.

Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. ""here we"") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. ""broader significance"").
