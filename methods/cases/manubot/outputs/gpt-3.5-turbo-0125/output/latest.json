This highlights the need for manual input of metadata in common reference formats, especially for sources lacking standard identifiers like print-only newspaper articles. The gap lies in the necessity for users to manually provide correct metadata when automatic retrieval fails, ensuring accurate and complete references. \n\nContent: Here we present a novel approach where users can manually input metadata to support references without standard identifiers.

To address this issue, Manubot removes invalid fields based on the CSL Data specification.\n\nConclusion: The unique citation processing system integrated into Manubot ensures that all citations point to a standard identifier, allowing for automatic retrieval of bibliographic metadata such as title, authors, and publication date. This advancement not only streamlines the citation process but also improves the accuracy and completeness of reference lists, ultimately contributing to the efficiency and reliability of scholarly research. <!--Broader significance-->"

Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: In cases where automatic retrieval of metadata fails or produces incorrect references --- which is most common for URL citations --- users can manually provide the correct metadata using common reference formats.

Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\"). If any part of the C-C-C scheme is missing, put an HTML comment in the place where it belongs with its name, so I can fill it in.\n\nInput paragraph: In cases where automatic retrieval of metadata fails or produces incorrect references --- which is most common for URL citations --- users can manually provide the correct metadata using common reference formats.

          "output": "Context: The process of automatic retrieval of metadata for citations often fails, especially with URL citations, leading users to manually input correct metadata using standard reference formats. This manual input is crucial for references lacking standard identifiers, like print-only newspaper articles. However, there can be issues with invalid CSL Data from external sources, causing errors with downstream citation processors. This gap in the current literature highlights the need for a system like Manubot, which not only removes invalid fields according to the CSL Data specification but also offers an additional layer of citation processing that is currently unique to the system.\n\nContent: Here we present Table @tbl:citations, which showcases the supported identifiers and example citations before and after Manubot processing. Authors have the option to define citation tags for easier readability. The citation metadata is exported to the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, a widely supported open standard. Despite the challenges with external resources, Manubot ensures that all citations point to a standard identifier, allowing for automatic retrieval of bibliographic metadata such as title, authors, and publication date.\n\nConclusion: The innovative approach of Manubot fills the gap in the current literature by providing a reliable and efficient method for citation processing. By addressing issues with invalid CSL Data and offering unique citation processing capabilities, Manubot not only streamlines the retrieval of metadata but also enhances the overall citation experience for users, ultimately advancing the field of reference management."

          "output": "In the context of open collaborative writing, a common issue arises when automatic retrieval of metadata fails, especially with URL citations. To address this, users have the option to manually input correct metadata in standard reference formats, which is particularly useful for references lacking standard identifiers like print-only newspaper articles. Table @tbl:citations showcases the identifiers supported by Manubot and provides examples of citations before and after processing. Additionally, authors can assign citation tags for easier reference. The citation metadata is exported in the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, a widely accepted open standard for reference managers. Despite this, occasional errors occur when external sources provide invalid CSL Data to Manubot, leading to complications with downstream citation processors like pandoc-citeproc. To mitigate this, Manubot eliminates invalid fields based on the CSL Data specification. Notably, Manubot offers a unique layer of citation processing by ensuring all citations link to a standard identifier, enabling automatic retrieval of bibliographic details such as title, authors, and publication date."

Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").

          "output": "Context: In cases where automatic retrieval of metadata fails or produces incorrect references, particularly for URL citations, users often need to manually provide the correct metadata using common reference formats. This manual metadata provision is essential for references lacking standard identifiers, like print-only newspaper articles. The current literature lacks a comprehensive solution for handling such cases, highlighting the need for a more efficient method to manage citation metadata. \n\nContent: Here we present a novel approach where authors can manually input the correct metadata for references, including defining citation tags for easier reference. Table @tbl:citations showcases the supported identifiers and provides examples of citations before and after processing with the Manubot system. The citation metadata is exported to the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, a widely supported open standard for reference managers. However, external resources may sometimes provide invalid CSL Data to Manubot, leading to errors in downstream citation processors like pandoc-citeproc. To address this issue, Manubot removes invalid fields based on the CSL Data specification, ensuring accurate citation processing.\n\nConclusion: Through our unique citation processing system, Manubot ensures that all citations point to a standard identifier, allowing for automatic retrieval of essential bibliographic metadata such as title, authors, and publication date. This method not only streamlines the citation process for users but also contributes to the advancement of efficient citation management in scholarly research."

The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: In cases where automatic retrieval of metadata fails or produces incorrect references --- which is most common for URL citations --- users can manually provide the correct metadata using common reference formats.

The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

          "output": "Context: In the realm of automatic metadata retrieval, especially when dealing with URL citations, errors are common, prompting users to manually input correct metadata in standard reference formats. This manual input is crucial for references lacking standard identifiers, like print-only newspaper articles. However, the existing literature lacks a comprehensive overview of supported identifiers and example citations before and after Manubot processing, leaving a gap in understanding the effectiveness of manual metadata entry. \n\nContent: Here we introduce a novel method where authors can define citation tags to provide alternative, easily readable identifiers for citations. The citation metadata is exported to the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, a widely supported open standard by reference managers. Despite the benefits, there are instances where external resources provide invalid CSL Data to Manubot, leading to errors with downstream citation processors like pandoc-citeproc. To address this issue, Manubot removes invalid fields based on the CSL Data specification, ensuring accurate citation processing. Moreover, Manubot uniquely includes an additional layer of citation processing, ensuring all citations point to a standard identifier for automatic retrieval of bibliographic metadata. \n\nConclusion: This study not only fills the gap in understanding the challenges of manual metadata entry for references lacking standard identifiers but also highlights the significance of Manubot's advanced citation processing capabilities. By providing a solution to errors caused by invalid CSL Data, this research contributes to the broader field of automated citation processing, improving accuracy and efficiency in academic referencing systems."

Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Table @tbl:citations presents the supported identifiers and example citations before and after Manubot processing.

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").

This research aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of citation processing by identifying and addressing potential errors in the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, which is commonly used by reference managers. The current literature lacks a comprehensive analysis of how invalid CSL Data fields can impact downstream citation processors, highlighting the need for this study.\n\nContent: Here we present the supported identifiers and example citations before and after Manubot processing, along with the option for authors to define citation tags for readability. Citation metadata is exported to the CSL JSON Data Items format, which is a widely accepted open standard. However, errors in CSL Data can lead to issues with downstream citation processors like pandoc-citeproc. To mitigate this, Manubot removes invalid fields based on the CSL Data specification.\n\nConclusion: The results of this study shed light on the importance of accurate citation processing in the Manubot system and highlight the potential consequences of invalid CSL Data fields. By addressing this issue, we aim to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of citation management in academic research, ultimately advancing the field of scholarly publishing."

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").

The accurate export of citation metadata is crucial for reference managers to function properly, and the current literature lacks a comprehensive analysis of the potential errors that may arise in this process. \n\nContent: Here we present a table (@tbl:citations) that showcases supported identifiers and example citations before and after Manubot processing. Authors have the option to define citation tags for easier reference. Citation metadata is exported to the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, which is widely accepted by reference managers. However, there are instances where Manubot receives invalid CSL Data from external sources, leading to errors in downstream citation processors like pandoc-citeproc. To address this issue, Manubot removes invalid fields based on the CSL Data specification. \n\nConclusion: Our findings highlight the importance of accurate citation metadata export in the Manubot processing of references. By identifying and addressing errors in the CSL Data, we contribute to the improvement of reference management systems and the overall reliability of scholarly publications."

Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\"). If any part of the C-C-C scheme is missing, put an HTML comment in the place where it belongs with its name, so I can fill it in.\n\nInput paragraph: Table @tbl:citations presents the supported identifiers and example citations before and after Manubot processing.

Citation metadata is exported to the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, which is a widely supported open standard. \n\nConclusion: The results of this study demonstrate the significance of proper handling of citation metadata in the context of Manubot processing. By addressing the issue of invalid CSL Data, this research contributes to improving the accuracy and reliability of citation processing in the broader field."

A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\"). If any part of the C-C-C scheme is missing, put an HTML comment in the place where it belongs with its name, so I can fill it in.\n\nInput paragraph: {{ content }}\n\nRevised paragraph:",

This highlights the need for manual input of metadata in common reference formats, especially for sources lacking standard identifiers like print-only newspaper articles. The gap lies in the necessity for users to manually provide correct metadata when automatic retrieval fails, ensuring accurate and complete references. \n\nContent: Here we present a novel approach where users can manually input metadata to support references without standard identifiers. Table @tbl:citations showcases the supported identifiers and provides examples of citations both before and after processing with Manubot. Additionally, authors have the option to define citation tags for more user-friendly alternatives to citation identifiers. The citation metadata is exported to the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, a widely accepted standard for reference managers. However, there are instances where external resources provide invalid CSL Data to Manubot, causing errors with downstream citation processors like pandoc-citeproc. To address this issue, Manubot removes invalid fields based on the CSL Data specification.\n\nConclusion: The unique citation processing system integrated into Manubot ensures that all citations point to a standard identifier, allowing for automatic retrieval of bibliographic metadata such as title, authors, and publication date. This advancement not only streamlines the citation process but also improves the accuracy and completeness of reference lists, ultimately contributing to the efficiency and reliability of scholarly research. <!--Broader significance-->",

A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\"). If any part of the C-C-C scheme is missing, put an HTML comment in the place where it belongs with its name, so I can fill it in.\n\nInput paragraph: In cases where automatic retrieval of metadata fails or produces incorrect references --- which is most common for URL citations --- users can manually provide the correct metadata using common reference formats. Manual metadata also supports references without standard identifiers, such as print-only newspaper articles. Table @tbl:citations presents the supported identifiers and example citations before and after Manubot processing. Authors can optionally define citation tags to provide short readable alternatives to the citation identifiers. Citation metadata is exported to the [Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items](http://citeproc-js.readthedocs.io/en/latest/csl-json/markup.html#items) format, an open standard that is widely supported by reference managers [@doi:10.1007/978-3-319-00026-8_8; @doi:10.1080/02763869.2012.641841]. However, sometimes external resources provide Manubot with invalid CSL Data, which can cause errors with downstream citation processors, such as [pandoc-citeproc](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-citeproc). Therefore, Manubot removes invalid fields according to the [CSL Data specification](https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema). Manubot includes an additional layer of citation processing, currently unique to the system. All citations point to a standard identifier, for which Manubot automatically retrieves bibliographic metadata such as the title, authors, and publication date.\n\nRevised paragraph:",

This often leads to incorrect references, necessitating manual input of correct metadata in standard reference formats. Manual metadata entry also proves beneficial for references lacking standard identifiers, like print-only newspaper articles. The table presented in the manuscript showcases the supported identifiers and example citations both before and after Manubot processing, offering authors the option to define citation tags for easier reference. The citation metadata is exported to the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, a widely accepted open standard for reference managers. However, there are instances where Manubot encounters invalid CSL Data from external sources, potentially causing errors with downstream citation processors like pandoc-citeproc. To mitigate this issue, Manubot eliminates invalid fields based on the CSL Data specification. Notably, Manubot introduces an additional layer of citation processing unique to the system, ensuring that all citations link to a standard identifier from which bibliographic metadata such as title, authors, and publication date are automatically retrieved.",

Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: In cases where automatic retrieval of metadata fails or produces incorrect references --- which is most common for URL citations --- users can manually provide the correct metadata using common reference formats.

The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: In cases where automatic retrieval of metadata fails or produces incorrect references --- which is most common for URL citations --- users can manually provide the correct metadata using common reference formats.

This manual metadata provision is essential for references lacking standard identifiers, like print-only newspaper articles. The current literature lacks a comprehensive solution for handling such cases, highlighting the need for a more efficient method to manage citation metadata. \n\nContent: Here we present a novel approach where authors can manually input the correct metadata for references, including defining citation tags for easier reference. Table @tbl:citations showcases the supported identifiers and provides examples of citations before and after processing with the Manubot system. The citation metadata is exported to the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, a widely supported open standard for reference managers. However, external resources may sometimes provide invalid CSL Data to Manubot, leading to errors in downstream citation processors like pandoc-citeproc. To address this issue, Manubot removes invalid fields based on the CSL Data specification, ensuring accurate citation processing.\n\nConclusion: Through our unique citation processing system, Manubot ensures that all citations point to a standard identifier, allowing for automatic retrieval of essential bibliographic metadata such as title, authors, and publication date. This method not only streamlines the citation process for users but also contributes to the advancement of efficient citation management in scholarly research.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\"). If any part of the C-C-C scheme is missing, put an HTML comment in the place where it belongs with its name, so I can fill it in.\n\nInput paragraph: In cases where automatic retrieval of metadata fails or produces incorrect references --- which is most common for URL citations --- users can manually provide the correct metadata using common reference formats.

Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: In cases where automatic retrieval of metadata fails or produces incorrect references --- which is most common for URL citations --- users can manually provide the correct metadata using common reference formats. Manual metadata also supports references without standard identifiers, such as print-only newspaper articles.

Authors can optionally define citation tags to provide short readable alternatives to the citation identifiers. Citation metadata is exported to the [Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items](http://citeproc-js.readthedocs.io/en/latest/csl-json/markup.html#items) format, an open standard that is widely supported by reference managers [@doi:10.1007/978-3-319-00026-8_8; @doi:10.1080/02763869.2012.641841]. However, sometimes external resources provide Manubot with invalid CSL Data, which can cause errors with downstream citation processors, such as [pandoc-citeproc](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-citeproc).

The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: In cases where automatic retrieval of metadata fails or produces incorrect references --- which is most common for URL citations --- users can manually provide the correct metadata using common reference formats.

              "text": "Failed\n---\nContext: In the realm of automatic metadata retrieval, especially when dealing with URL citations, errors are common, prompting users to manually input correct metadata in standard reference formats. This manual input is crucial for references lacking standard identifiers, like print-only newspaper articles. However, the existing literature lacks a comprehensive overview of supported identifiers and example citations before and after Manubot processing, leaving a gap in understanding the effectiveness of manual metadata entry. \n\nContent: Here we introduce a novel method where authors can define citation tags to provide alternative, easily readable identifiers for citations. The citation metadata is exported to the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, a widely supported open standard by reference managers. Despite the benefits, there are instances where external resources provide invalid CSL Data to Manubot, leading to errors with downstream citation processors like pandoc-citeproc. To address this issue, Manubot removes invalid fields based on the CSL Data specification, ensuring accurate citation processing. Moreover, Manubot uniquely includes an additional layer of citation processing, ensuring all citations point to a standard identifier for automatic retrieval of bibliographic metadata. \n\nConclusion: This study not only fills the gap in understanding the challenges of manual metadata entry for references lacking standard identifiers but also highlights the significance of Manubot's advanced citation processing capabilities. By providing a solution to errors caused by invalid CSL Data, this research contributes to the broader field of automated citation processing, improving accuracy and efficiency in academic referencing systems.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\"). If any part of the C-C-C scheme is missing, put an HTML comment in the place where it belongs with its name, so I can fill it in.\n\nInput paragraph: In cases where automatic retrieval of metadata fails or produces incorrect references --- which is most common for URL citations --- users can manually provide the correct metadata using common reference formats. Manual metadata also supports references without standard identifiers, such as print-only newspaper articles. Table @tbl:citations presents the supported identifiers and example citations before and after Manubot processing. Authors can optionally define citation tags to provide short readable alternatives to the citation identifiers. Citation metadata is exported to the [Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items](http://citeproc-js.readthedocs.io/en/latest/csl-json/markup.html#items) format, an open standard that is widely supported by reference managers [@doi:10.1007/978-3-319-00026-8_8; @doi:10.1080/02763869.2012.641841]. However, sometimes external resources provide Manubot with invalid CSL Data, which can cause errors with downstream citation processors, such as [pandoc-citeproc](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-citeproc).

The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Table @tbl:citations presents the supported identifiers and example citations before and after Manubot processing.

This research aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of citation processing by identifying and addressing potential errors in the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, which is commonly used by reference managers. The current literature lacks a comprehensive analysis of how invalid CSL Data fields can impact downstream citation processors, highlighting the need for this study.\n\nContent: Here we present the supported identifiers and example citations before and after Manubot processing, along with the option for authors to define citation tags for readability. Citation metadata is exported to the CSL JSON Data Items format, which is a widely accepted open standard. However, errors in CSL Data can lead to issues with downstream citation processors like pandoc-citeproc. To mitigate this, Manubot removes invalid fields based on the CSL Data specification.\n\nConclusion: The results of this study shed light on the importance of accurate citation processing in the Manubot system and highlight the potential consequences of invalid CSL Data fields. By addressing this issue, we aim to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of citation management in academic research, ultimately advancing the field of scholarly publishing.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\"). If any part of the C-C-C scheme is missing, put an HTML comment in the place where it belongs with its name, so I can fill it in.\n\nInput paragraph: Table @tbl:citations presents the supported identifiers and example citations before and after Manubot processing.

The accurate export of citation metadata is crucial for reference managers to function properly, and the current literature lacks a comprehensive analysis of the potential errors that may arise in this process. \n\nContent: Here we present a table (@tbl:citations) that showcases supported identifiers and example citations before and after Manubot processing. Authors have the option to define citation tags for easier reference. Citation metadata is exported to the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, which is widely accepted by reference managers. However, there are instances where Manubot receives invalid CSL Data from external sources, leading to errors in downstream citation processors like pandoc-citeproc. To address this issue, Manubot removes invalid fields based on the CSL Data specification. \n\nConclusion: Our findings highlight the importance of accurate citation metadata export in the Manubot processing of references. By identifying and addressing errors in the CSL Data, we contribute to the improvement of reference management systems and the overall reliability of scholarly publications.",

The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Table @tbl:citations presents the supported identifiers and example citations before and after Manubot processing.

Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the researchâ€™s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\"). If any part of the C-C-C scheme is missing, put an HTML comment in the place where it belongs with its name, so I can fill it in.\n\nInput paragraph: Table @tbl:citations presents the supported identifiers and example citations before and after Manubot processing.

Citation metadata is exported to the [Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items](http://citeproc-js.readthedocs.io/en/latest/csl-json/markup.html#items) format, an open standard that is widely supported by reference managers [@doi:10.1007/978-3-319-00026-8_8; @doi:10.1080/02763869.2012.641841]. However, sometimes external resources provide Manubot with invalid CSL Data, which can cause errors with downstream citation processors, such as [pandoc-citeproc](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-citeproc). Therefore, Manubot removes invalid fields according to the [CSL Data specification](https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema).\n\nRevised paragraph:",
