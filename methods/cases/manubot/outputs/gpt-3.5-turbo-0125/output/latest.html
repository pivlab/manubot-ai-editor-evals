Context: In the realm of automatic metadata retrieval, issues often arise with URL citations, leading to incorrect or failed references. This highlights the need for manual input of metadata in common reference formats, especially for sources lacking standard identifiers like print-only newspaper articles. The gap lies in the necessity for users to manually provide correct metadata when automatic retrieval fails, ensuring accurate and complete references. 

Content: Here we present a novel approach where users can manually input metadata to support references without standard identifiers. Table @tbl:citations showcases the supported identifiers and provides examples of citations both before and after processing with Manubot. Additionally, authors have the option to define citation tags for more user-friendly alternatives to citation identifiers. The citation metadata is exported to the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, a widely accepted standard for reference managers. However, there are instances where external resources provide invalid CSL Data to Manubot, causing errors with downstream citation processors like pandoc-citeproc. To address this issue, Manubot removes invalid fields based on the CSL Data specification.

Conclusion: The unique citation processing system integrated into Manubot ensures that all citations point to a standard identifier, allowing for automatic retrieval of bibliographic metadata such as title, authors, and publication date. This advancement not only streamlines the citation process but also improves the accuracy and completeness of reference lists, ultimately contributing to the efficiency and reliability of scholarly research. &lt;!--Broader significance--&gt;

However, external resources may sometimes provide invalid CSL Data to Manubot, leading to errors in downstream citation processors like pandoc-citeproc. To address this issue, Manubot removes invalid fields based on the CSL Data specification, ensuring accurate citation processing.

Conclusion: Through our unique citation processing system, Manubot ensures that all citations point to a standard identifier, allowing for automatic retrieval of essential bibliographic metadata such as title, authors, and publication date. This method not only streamlines the citation process for users but also contributes to the advancement of efficient citation management in scholarly research.

Context: In cases where automatic retrieval of metadata fails or produces incorrect references, particularly for URL citations, users often need to manually provide the correct metadata using common reference formats. This manual metadata provision is essential for references lacking standard identifiers, like print-only newspaper articles. The current literature lacks a comprehensive solution for handling such cases, highlighting the need for a more efficient method to manage citation metadata. 

Content: Here we present a novel approach where authors can manually input the correct metadata for references, including defining citation tags for easier reference.

Context: In the realm of automatic metadata retrieval, especially when dealing with URL citations, errors are common, prompting users to manually input correct metadata in standard reference formats. This manual input is crucial for references lacking standard identifiers, like print-only newspaper articles. However, the existing literature lacks a comprehensive overview of supported identifiers and example citations before and after Manubot processing, leaving a gap in understanding the effectiveness of manual metadata entry. 

Content: Here we introduce a novel method where authors can define citation tags to provide alternative, easily readable identifiers for citations. The citation metadata is exported to the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, a widely supported open standard by reference managers. Despite the benefits, there are instances where external resources provide invalid CSL Data to Manubot, leading to errors with downstream citation processors like pandoc-citeproc.

Moreover, Manubot uniquely includes an additional layer of citation processing, ensuring all citations point to a standard identifier for automatic retrieval of bibliographic metadata. 

Conclusion: This study not only fills the gap in understanding the challenges of manual metadata entry for references lacking standard identifiers but also highlights the significance of Manubot&#39;s advanced citation processing capabilities. By providing a solution to errors caused by invalid CSL Data, this research contributes to the broader field of automated citation processing, improving accuracy and efficiency in academic referencing systems.

Context: The manuscript addresses the issue of citation processing in the Manubot system, specifically focusing on the handling of citation identifiers and metadata. This research aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of citation processing by identifying and addressing potential errors in the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, which is commonly used by reference managers. The current literature lacks a comprehensive analysis of how invalid CSL Data fields can impact downstream citation processors, highlighting the need for this study.

Content: Here we present the supported identifiers and example citations before and after Manubot processing, along with the option for authors to define citation tags for readability. Citation metadata is exported to the CSL JSON Data Items format, which is a widely accepted open standard. However, errors in CSL Data can lead to issues with downstream citation processors like pandoc-citeproc. To mitigate this, Manubot removes invalid fields based on the CSL Data specification.

Conclusion: The results of this study shed light on the importance of accurate citation processing in the Manubot system and highlight the potential consequences of invalid CSL Data fields. By addressing this issue, we aim to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of citation management in academic research, ultimately advancing the field of scholarly publishing.

Context: The manuscript addresses the issue of handling citation metadata before and after Manubot processing. While authors have the option to define citation tags for readability, sometimes external resources provide Manubot with invalid CSL Data, leading to errors with downstream citation processors. This gap in the current literature highlights the importance of ensuring the accuracy of citation metadata to avoid potential issues during processing.

Content: Here we present the supported identifiers and example citations pre- and post-Manubot processing, along with the removal of invalid fields according to the CSL Data specification. Citation metadata is exported to the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, which is a widely supported open standard. 

Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate the significance of proper handling of citation metadata in the context of Manubot processing.

Context: The manuscript addresses the issue of handling citation metadata before and after Manubot processing. While authors have the option to define citation tags for readability, sometimes external resources provide Manubot with invalid CSL Data, leading to errors with downstream citation processors. This gap in the current literature highlights the importance of ensuring the accuracy of citation metadata to avoid potential issues during processing.

Content: Here we present the supported identifiers and example citations pre- and post-Manubot processing, along with the removal of invalid fields according to the CSL Data specification. Citation metadata is exported to the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, which is a widely supported open standard. 

Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate the significance of proper handling of citation metadata in the context of Manubot processing. By addressing the issue of invalid CSL Data, this research contributes to improving the accuracy and reliability of citation processing in the broader field.
