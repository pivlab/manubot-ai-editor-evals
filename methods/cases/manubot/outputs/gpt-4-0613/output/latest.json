          "output": "Within the broader field of open science, a significant challenge resides in the accurate and reproducible citation of various sources, particularly those without standard identifiers such as URL citations and print-only articles. This manuscript addresses this gap by introducing Manubot, a tool designed to enhance the quality and reliability of metadata retrieval for a wide range of references. Manubot allows users to manually input metadata using common reference formats when automatic retrieval fails or produces incorrect references. As demonstrated in Table @tbl:citations, the tool supports a diverse set of identifiers and enables authors to define citation tags for more readable alternatives. The metadata is exported to the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, a widely supported open standard. However, the system occasionally encounters invalid CSL Data from external resources, potentially leading to downstream citation processor errors. To mitigate this, Manubot removes invalid fields in accordance with the CSL Data specification. Unique to Manubot is an additional layer of citation processing where all citations point to a standard identifier, allowing automatic retrieval of key bibliographic metadata. The introduction of Manubot significantly enhances the reproducibility and provenance of citations in collaborative writing, thereby advancing the field of open science."

The system also offers optional citation tags to provide readable alternatives to citation identifiers. The citation metadata is then exported to the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, a widely supported open standard. However, Manubot occasionally receives invalid CSL Data from external resources, causing errors with downstream citation processors. To mitigate this, Manubot removes invalid fields according to the CSL Data specification. Furthermore, Manubot includes an additional layer of citation processing, unique to the system, where all citations point to a standard identifier. This system automatically retrieves bibliographic metadata such as the title, authors, and publication date. This novel approach to citation management not only addresses the current gaps but also advances the field by providing a more reliable and comprehensive citation management system."

Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\"). If any part of the C-C-C scheme is missing, put an HTML comment in the place where it belongs with its name, so I can fill it in.\n\nInput paragraph: In cases where automatic retrieval of metadata fails or produces incorrect references --- which is most common for URL citations --- users can manually provide the correct metadata using common reference formats.

Authors can optionally define citation tags to provide short readable alternatives to the citation identifiers.

          "output": "Given the increasing prevalence of digital resources, the accurate retrieval of metadata for citations, especially from URLs, remains a challenge. This gap is particularly apparent when considering non-standard resources like print-only newspaper articles. Our research introduces a novel approach to address this issue, utilizing the Manubot system. Manubot allows users to manually input correct metadata when automatic retrieval fails or produces incorrect references. Our method also supports references without standard identifiers, as shown in Table @tbl:citations. Additionally, authors can define citation tags to provide short, readable alternatives to citation identifiers. Manubot exports citation metadata to the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, a widely accepted open standard. However, it's worth noting that invalid CSL Data from external resources can cause errors with downstream citation processors. To mitigate this, Manubot removes invalid fields as per the CSL Data specification. Notably, Manubot includes an additional layer of citation processing, a feature currently unique to the system, where all citations point to a standard identifier, and bibliographic metadata like the title, authors, and publication date are automatically retrieved. This research fills a significant gap in the current literature by providing a method to handle non-standard and difficult-to-reference materials, thereby advancing the broader field of digital citation management."

          "output": "Within the broader field of open science and collaborative writing, the challenge of accurately and efficiently managing references has remained a persistent issue, particularly when automatic metadata retrieval fails or generates incorrect references, a problem frequently encountered with URL citations. This study introduces Manubot, a novel approach that allows users to manually provide accurate metadata using common reference formats, thereby accommodating references without standard identifiers like print-only newspaper articles. Manubot's capabilities and example citations are demonstrated in Table @tbl:citations. In addition, Manubot enables authors to define citation tags, offering short, readable alternatives to citation identifiers. All citation metadata is exported to the widely supported Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format. However, issues can arise when external resources supply Manubot with invalid CSL Data, potentially causing errors with downstream citation processors. To address this, Manubot removes invalid fields in accordance with the CSL Data specification and incorporates an additional layer of citation processing unique to the system. Resultantly, all citations point to a standard identifier, with Manubot automatically retrieving key bibliographic metadata such as title, authors, and publication date. This innovative approach to citation management not only enhances the accuracy and efficiency of referencing in collaborative writing but also advances the broader field of open science by promoting reproducibility and provenance."

Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").

This gap is especially significant in cases of references lacking standard identifiers, such as print-only newspaper articles. Our research addresses this gap with Manubot, a system that allows users to manually provide correct metadata and supports references without standard identifiers. As shown in Table @tbl:citations, Manubot processes identifiers and citations and offers the option for authors to define citation tags as short, readable alternatives to citation identifiers. The processed citation metadata is then exported to the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, an open standard widely supported by reference managers. However, Manubot sometimes receives invalid CSL Data from external resources, causing errors with downstream citation processors, such as pandoc-citeproc. To counter this, Manubot removes invalid fields as per the CSL Data specification. In a novel approach unique to the system, Manubot adds another layer of citation processing: all citations are linked to a standard identifier, from which Manubot automatically retrieves bibliographic metadata like title, authors, and publication date. The successful implementation of Manubot not only resolves the issue of incorrect or missing metadata but also advances the broader field of metadata retrieval by introducing an additional layer of citation processing."

Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: In cases where automatic retrieval of metadata fails or produces incorrect references --- which is most common for URL citations --- users can manually provide the correct metadata using common reference formats.

          "output": "In the broader field of collaborative writing, the challenge of accurate citation retrieval, particularly for URL references, remains an unresolved issue. Existing literature lacks a comprehensive solution that ensures accuracy, supports non-standard references, and maintains compatibility with open standards. This research presents the Manubot system, a novel approach designed to address this gap. Manubot enables users to manually input correct metadata in common reference formats when automatic retrieval fails or produces inaccurate results, effectively accommodating references without standard identifiers, such as print-only newspaper articles. The system exports citation metadata to the widely supported Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, as illustrated in Table @tbl:citations with supported identifiers and example citations. To enhance readability, authors can define citation tags as alternatives to citation identifiers. However, the system can encounter invalid CSL Data from external resources, potentially causing errors with downstream citation processors like pandoc-citeproc. To mitigate this, Manubot eliminates invalid fields as per the CSL Data specification. Unique to Manubot, an additional layer of citation processing ensures all citations point to a standard identifier, automatically retrieving critical bibliographic metadata. In conclusion, Manubot offers a robust solution to the citation retrieval challenge in collaborative writing, enhancing reproducibility and provenance while advancing the open science movement."

This gap in accurate and efficient citation management poses a challenge for users who need to manually provide the correct metadata using common reference formats, including references without standard identifiers such as print-only newspaper articles. To address this issue, we introduced Manubot, a novel system that supports manual metadata and allows authors to define citation tags for short readable alternatives to citation identifiers. Manubot processes the provided metadata and exports it to the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, a widely supported open standard by reference managers. However, Manubot sometimes receives invalid CSL Data from external resources, causing errors with downstream citation processors. To prevent this, Manubot removes invalid fields according to the CSL Data specification and includes an additional layer of citation processing, unique to the system, where all citations point to a standard identifier. Manubot then automatically retrieves bibliographic metadata such as the title, authors, and publication date. By addressing the specific gap in citation management, Manubot enhances the accuracy and efficiency of digital citation management, pushing the broader field forward by providing a reliable solution for both automatic and manual citation metadata retrieval."

          "output": "The widespread issue of incorrect or failed automatic metadata retrieval, particularly for URL citations, presents a significant gap in the field of open collaborative writing. This is especially problematic for references without standard identifiers, such as print-only newspaper articles. To address this gap, we developed a novel approach using Manubot, which allows users to manually provide accurate metadata using common reference formats. Manubot also offers an optional feature where authors can define citation tags to provide more readable alternatives to citation identifiers. All citation data is exported to the widely supported Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format. However, we found that external resources sometimes supply Manubot with invalid CSL Data, leading to errors with downstream citation processors. In response, we enhanced Manubot's functionality by adding a layer of citation processing that removes invalid fields according to the CSL Data specification. Furthermore, Manubot ensures that all citations point to a standard identifier, automatically retrieving essential bibliographic metadata such as title, authors, and publication date. This unique feature of Manubot not only resolves the specific issue of incorrect metadata retrieval but also advances the broader field of open science by enhancing reproducibility and provenance in collaborative writing."

Therefore, Manubot removes invalid fields according to the [CSL Data specification](https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema).

          "output": "In the realm of digital citation management, an open issue is the frequent failure or inaccuracy of automatic metadata retrieval, particularly for URL citations, and the lack of support for references without standard identifiers, such as print-only newspaper articles. Our research introduces a novel approach to this problem with the use of Manubot, a system that allows users to manually provide correct metadata using common reference formats. As depicted in Table @tbl:citations, Manubot processes both supported identifiers and example citations, with an option for authors to define citation tags as short, readable alternatives. The system exports citation metadata to the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, a widely supported open standard. However, issues can arise with invalid CSL Data from external resources, which can disrupt downstream citation processors. To counter this, Manubot removes invalid fields in accordance with the CSL Data specification. Unique to Manubot is an additional layer of citation processing, where all citations point to a standard identifier, and the system automatically retrieves bibliographic metadata such as title, authors, and publication date. The introduction of Manubot not only addresses the current gap in accurate and flexible citation management but also brings a significant advancement in the broader field of digital publishing by optimizing the process of citation handling."

The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Table @tbl:citations presents the supported identifiers and example citations before and after Manubot processing.

This paper introduces Manubot, a novel approach to open collaborative writing that addresses this gap. As presented in Table @tbl:citations, Manubot supports a range of identifiers and provides examples of citations before and after processing. Authors have the option to define citation tags, offering short, readable alternatives to traditional citation identifiers. The system exports citation metadata to the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, a widely supported open standard. Despite the occasional receipt of invalid CSL Data from external resources, which can cause issues with downstream citation processors like pandoc-citeproc, Manubot effectively removes these invalid fields in accordance with the CSL Data specification. Therefore, Manubot not only provides a solution to the specific issue of citation processing in collaborative writing but also contributes to the broader aim of enhancing reproducibility and provenance in open science."

Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").

This paper aims to address this issue through the application of Manubot, a tool designed to streamline the citation process. However, despite its broad utility and acceptance, a gap remains in the handling of invalid Citation Style Language (CSL) Data, which can cause errors with downstream citation processors. This research aims to tackle this specific problem. We present a method where Manubot supports certain identifiers and provides examples of citations before and after processing, as detailed in Table @tbl:citations. Authors have the option to define citation tags for more readable alternatives. The citation metadata is exported to the CSL JSON Data Items format, a widely accepted open standard supported by various reference managers. However, external resources sometimes provide Manubot with invalid CSL Data, leading to downstream processing errors. To counter this, we have improved Manubot to remove invalid fields according to the CSL Data specification. Our results show that this method effectively prevents the occurrence of such errors. In conclusion, this research not only addresses the problem of invalid CSL Data in Manubot but also enhances the tool's overall efficiency and reliability in academic citation and referencing. This advancement is a significant contribution to the field, improving the accuracy and ease of academic writing."

The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").

          "output": "In the realm of scientific writing, the process of citation management is often fraught with challenges, a gap that Manubot aims to address. This manuscript introduces Manubot, a tool designed to streamline and simplify citation processes. As detailed in Table @tbl:citations, Manubot supports various identifiers and offers a before-and-after comparison of example citations. A unique feature of Manubot is its ability to allow authors to define optional citation tags, offering short, readable alternatives to traditional citation identifiers. Furthermore, Manubot exports citation metadata to the widely supported Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, an open standard recognized by numerous reference managers. However, it is important to note that Manubot sometimes encounters invalid CSL Data from external resources, which can lead to errors with downstream citation processors like pandoc-citeproc. To mitigate this, Manubot has been designed to remove invalid fields in accordance with the CSL Data specification. In conclusion, Manubot presents a significant advancement in citation management, helping authors navigate the often complex and time-consuming process of referencing, while addressing the potential issue of invalid data. This innovation has broader implications for the scientific community, potentially transforming the way citations are managed and processed."

Manubot, a software designed to address this issue, allows authors to define citation tags, offering a more readable alternative to citation identifiers, as illustrated in Table @tbl:citations. This software exports citation metadata to the widely supported open standard, Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items, which is compatible with numerous reference managers. However, the use of external resources can sometimes lead to invalid CSL Data, causing downstream citation processing errors. In response to this, Manubot has been developed to automatically remove any invalid fields in accordance with the CSL Data specification, thereby enhancing the reproducibility and provenance of collaborative writing. This advancement in handling citation metadata not only streamlines the writing process but also contributes to the broader goals of open science by improving the reliability and efficiency of collaborative research."

Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\"). If any part of the C-C-C scheme is missing, put an HTML comment in the place where it belongs with its name, so I can fill it in.\n\nInput paragraph: Table @tbl:citations presents the supported identifiers and example citations before and after Manubot processing.

Current literature lacks an efficient, user-friendly process that is compatible with a variety of reference managers. This study seeks to address this gap by introducing Manubot, a novel method for handling citations. Table @tbl:citations demonstrates how Manubot supports a variety of identifiers and can transform citations before and after processing. Authors also have the option to define citation tags, offering a more readable alternative to citation identifiers. Manubot exports citation metadata to the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, an open standard widely supported by reference managers. However, issues can arise when Manubot receives invalid CSL Data from external resources, which can disrupt downstream citation processors such as pandoc-citeproc. To mitigate this, Manubot is designed to remove invalid fields in accordance with the CSL Data specification. The introduction of Manubot presents a significant stride forward in the academic writing process, offering a more streamlined, accessible approach to citations and potentially advancing the broader field of academic writing."

Our manuscript addresses this gap by introducing Manubot, a tool designed to streamline the citation process. As detailed in Table @tbl:citations, Manubot supports various identifiers and provides the option for authors to define citation tags for readability. The tool exports citation metadata to the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, a widely accepted open standard among reference managers. However, Manubot encounters occasional issues with invalid CSL Data from external resources, leading to errors with downstream citation processors such as pandoc-citeproc. To rectify this, Manubot has been designed to remove invalid fields in accordance with the CSL Data specification. This innovative approach to handling citations not only addresses the immediate problem of invalid data but also contributes to the larger goal of improving reproducibility and provenance in open science writing."

This paper addresses this gap by introducing Manubot, a tool that enhances reproducibility and provenance in manuscript writing. As presented in Table @tbl:citations, Manubot supports various identifiers and provides the option for authors to define citation tags for more readable alternatives. It exports citation metadata to the widely supported Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format. Despite this, Manubot occasionally encounters invalid CSL Data from external resources, which can cause errors with downstream citation processors like pandoc-citeproc. To mitigate this, Manubot is designed to remove invalid fields, adhering to the CSL Data specification. This innovative approach enhances the efficiency and accuracy of citation processing, contributing significantly to the broader field of open science and collaborative writing."

This manuscript addresses this gap by introducing Manubot, a tool designed to enhance the quality and reliability of metadata retrieval for a wide range of references. Manubot allows users to manually input metadata using common reference formats when automatic retrieval fails or produces incorrect references. As demonstrated in Table @tbl:citations, the tool supports a diverse set of identifiers and enables authors to define citation tags for more readable alternatives. The metadata is exported to the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, a widely supported open standard. However, the system occasionally encounters invalid CSL Data from external resources, potentially leading to downstream citation processor errors. To mitigate this, Manubot removes invalid fields in accordance with the CSL Data specification. Unique to Manubot is an additional layer of citation processing where all citations point to a standard identifier, allowing automatic retrieval of key bibliographic metadata. The introduction of Manubot significantly enhances the reproducibility and provenance of citations in collaborative writing, thereby advancing the field of open science.",

Additionally, the current methodologies do not support references without standard identifiers, such as print-only newspaper articles. To address these gaps, we introduced Manubot, a novel approach that allows users to manually provide the correct metadata using common reference formats. Manubot supports print-only articles and other references without standard identifiers, as presented in Table @tbl:citations. The system also offers optional citation tags to provide readable alternatives to citation identifiers. The citation metadata is then exported to the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, a widely supported open standard. However, Manubot occasionally receives invalid CSL Data from external resources, causing errors with downstream citation processors. To mitigate this, Manubot removes invalid fields according to the CSL Data specification. Furthermore, Manubot includes an additional layer of citation processing, unique to the system, where all citations point to a standard identifier. This system automatically retrieves bibliographic metadata such as the title, authors, and publication date. This novel approach to citation management not only addresses the current gaps but also advances the field by providing a more reliable and comprehensive citation management system.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\"). If any part of the C-C-C scheme is missing, put an HTML comment in the place where it belongs with its name, so I can fill it in.\n\nInput paragraph: In cases where automatic retrieval of metadata fails or produces incorrect references --- which is most common for URL citations --- users can manually provide the correct metadata using common reference formats.

This paper addresses the gap in the existing literature by introducing an innovative approach to this problem using Manubot, a software tool designed for open science collaboration. Manubot allows users to manually provide correct metadata using common reference formats, thereby supporting references without standard identifiers, such as print-only newspaper articles. This manual metadata entry, along with citation tags defined by authors, is exported to the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, a widely recognized open standard in reference management. However, the system can sometimes receive invalid CSL Data from external resources, leading to errors with downstream citation processors. To mitigate this, Manubot removes invalid fields according to the CSL Data specification and includes an additional layer of citation processing, unique to the system, where all citations point to a standard identifier. This process automatically retrieves essential bibliographic metadata such as title, authors, and publication date. The implementation of Manubot enhances the accuracy and reproducibility of citation metadata, thereby advancing the broader field of open collaborative writing and open science.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Open collaborative writing with Manubot' and keywords 'manuscript, open science, collaborative, writing, reproducibility, provenance, software, git, html.' Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: In cases where automatic retrieval of metadata fails or produces incorrect references --- which is most common for URL citations --- users can manually provide the correct metadata using common reference formats. Manual metadata also supports references without standard identifiers, such as print-only newspaper articles. Table @tbl:citations presents the supported identifiers and example citations before and after Manubot processing. Authors can optionally define citation tags to provide short readable alternatives to the citation identifiers. Citation metadata is exported to the [Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items](http://citeproc-js.readthedocs.io/en/latest/csl-json/markup.html#items) format, an open standard that is widely supported by reference managers [@doi:10.1007/978-3-319-00026-8_8; @doi:10.1080/02763869.2012.641841]. However, sometimes external resources provide Manubot with invalid CSL Data, which can cause errors with downstream citation processors, such as [pandoc-citeproc](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-citeproc). Therefore, Manubot removes invalid fields according to the [CSL Data specification](https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema).

This study introduces Manubot, a novel approach that allows users to manually provide accurate metadata using common reference formats, thereby accommodating references without standard identifiers like print-only newspaper articles. Manubot's capabilities and example citations are demonstrated in Table @tbl:citations. In addition, Manubot enables authors to define citation tags, offering short, readable alternatives to citation identifiers. All citation metadata is exported to the widely supported Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format. However, issues can arise when external resources supply Manubot with invalid CSL Data, potentially causing errors with downstream citation processors. To address this, Manubot removes invalid fields in accordance with the CSL Data specification and incorporates an additional layer of citation processing unique to the system. Resultantly, all citations point to a standard identifier, with Manubot automatically retrieving key bibliographic metadata such as title, authors, and publication date. This innovative approach to citation management not only enhances the accuracy and efficiency of referencing in collaborative writing but also advances the broader field of open science by promoting reproducibility and provenance.",

Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: In cases where automatic retrieval of metadata fails or produces incorrect references --- which is most common for URL citations --- users can manually provide the correct metadata using common reference formats.

This gap is especially significant in cases of references lacking standard identifiers, such as print-only newspaper articles. Our research addresses this gap with Manubot, a system that allows users to manually provide correct metadata and supports references without standard identifiers. As shown in Table @tbl:citations, Manubot processes identifiers and citations and offers the option for authors to define citation tags as short, readable alternatives to citation identifiers. The processed citation metadata is then exported to the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, an open standard widely supported by reference managers. However, Manubot sometimes receives invalid CSL Data from external resources, causing errors with downstream citation processors, such as pandoc-citeproc. To counter this, Manubot removes invalid fields as per the CSL Data specification. In a novel approach unique to the system, Manubot adds another layer of citation processing: all citations are linked to a standard identifier, from which Manubot automatically retrieves bibliographic metadata like title, authors, and publication date. The successful implementation of Manubot not only resolves the issue of incorrect or missing metadata but also advances the broader field of metadata retrieval by introducing an additional layer of citation processing.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\"). If any part of the C-C-C scheme is missing, put an HTML comment in the place where it belongs with its name, so I can fill it in.\n\nInput paragraph: In cases where automatic retrieval of metadata fails or produces incorrect references --- which is most common for URL citations --- users can manually provide the correct metadata using common reference formats. Manual metadata also supports references without standard identifiers, such as print-only newspaper articles. Table @tbl:citations presents the supported identifiers and example citations before and after Manubot processing. Authors can optionally define citation tags to provide short readable alternatives to the citation identifiers. Citation metadata is exported to the [Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items](http://citeproc-js.readthedocs.io/en/latest/csl-json/markup.html#items) format, an open standard that is widely supported by reference managers [@doi:10.1007/978-3-319-00026-8_8; @doi:10.1080/02763869.2012.641841].

Existing literature lacks a comprehensive solution that ensures accuracy, supports non-standard references, and maintains compatibility with open standards. This research presents the Manubot system, a novel approach designed to address this gap. Manubot enables users to manually input correct metadata in common reference formats when automatic retrieval fails or produces inaccurate results, effectively accommodating references without standard identifiers, such as print-only newspaper articles. The system exports citation metadata to the widely supported Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, as illustrated in Table @tbl:citations with supported identifiers and example citations. To enhance readability, authors can define citation tags as alternatives to citation identifiers. However, the system can encounter invalid CSL Data from external resources, potentially causing errors with downstream citation processors like pandoc-citeproc. To mitigate this, Manubot eliminates invalid fields as per the CSL Data specification. Unique to Manubot, an additional layer of citation processing ensures all citations point to a standard identifier, automatically retrieving critical bibliographic metadata. In conclusion, Manubot offers a robust solution to the citation retrieval challenge in collaborative writing, enhancing reproducibility and provenance while advancing the open science movement.",

This is especially problematic for references without standard identifiers, such as print-only newspaper articles. To address this gap, we developed a novel approach using Manubot, which allows users to manually provide accurate metadata using common reference formats. Manubot also offers an optional feature where authors can define citation tags to provide more readable alternatives to citation identifiers. All citation data is exported to the widely supported Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format. However, we found that external resources sometimes supply Manubot with invalid CSL Data, leading to errors with downstream citation processors. In response, we enhanced Manubot's functionality by adding a layer of citation processing that removes invalid fields according to the CSL Data specification. Furthermore, Manubot ensures that all citations point to a standard identifier, automatically retrieving essential bibliographic metadata such as title, authors, and publication date. This unique feature of Manubot not only resolves the specific issue of incorrect metadata retrieval but also advances the broader field of open science by enhancing reproducibility and provenance in collaborative writing.",

Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: In cases where automatic retrieval of metadata fails or produces incorrect references --- which is most common for URL citations --- users can manually provide the correct metadata using common reference formats.

Our research introduces a novel approach to this problem with the use of Manubot, a system that allows users to manually provide correct metadata using common reference formats. As depicted in Table @tbl:citations, Manubot processes both supported identifiers and example citations, with an option for authors to define citation tags as short, readable alternatives. The system exports citation metadata to the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, a widely supported open standard. However, issues can arise with invalid CSL Data from external resources, which can disrupt downstream citation processors. To counter this, Manubot removes invalid fields in accordance with the CSL Data specification. Unique to Manubot is an additional layer of citation processing, where all citations point to a standard identifier, and the system automatically retrieves bibliographic metadata such as title, authors, and publication date. The introduction of Manubot not only addresses the current gap in accurate and flexible citation management but also brings a significant advancement in the broader field of digital publishing by optimizing the process of citation handling.",

However, the current state-of-the-art lacks a streamlined, reproducible method for processing these elements, which can lead to errors and inconsistencies. This paper introduces Manubot, a novel approach to open collaborative writing that addresses this gap. As presented in Table @tbl:citations, Manubot supports a range of identifiers and provides examples of citations before and after processing. Authors have the option to define citation tags, offering short, readable alternatives to traditional citation identifiers. The system exports citation metadata to the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, a widely supported open standard. Despite the occasional receipt of invalid CSL Data from external resources, which can cause issues with downstream citation processors like pandoc-citeproc, Manubot effectively removes these invalid fields in accordance with the CSL Data specification. Therefore, Manubot not only provides a solution to the specific issue of citation processing in collaborative writing but also contributes to the broader aim of enhancing reproducibility and provenance in open science.",

Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Table @tbl:citations presents the supported identifiers and example citations before and after Manubot processing.

This paper aims to address this issue through the application of Manubot, a tool designed to streamline the citation process. However, despite its broad utility and acceptance, a gap remains in the handling of invalid Citation Style Language (CSL) Data, which can cause errors with downstream citation processors. This research aims to tackle this specific problem. We present a method where Manubot supports certain identifiers and provides examples of citations before and after processing, as detailed in Table @tbl:citations. Authors have the option to define citation tags for more readable alternatives. The citation metadata is exported to the CSL JSON Data Items format, a widely accepted open standard supported by various reference managers. However, external resources sometimes provide Manubot with invalid CSL Data, leading to downstream processing errors. To counter this, we have improved Manubot to remove invalid fields according to the CSL Data specification. Our results show that this method effectively prevents the occurrence of such errors. In conclusion, this research not only addresses the problem of invalid CSL Data in Manubot but also enhances the tool's overall efficiency and reliability in academic citation and referencing. This advancement is a significant contribution to the field, improving the accuracy and ease of academic writing.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\"). If any part of the C-C-C scheme is missing, put an HTML comment in the place where it belongs with its name, so I can fill it in.\n\nInput paragraph: Table @tbl:citations presents the supported identifiers and example citations before and after Manubot processing.

The manuscript introduces Manubot, a novel approach that supports various identifiers and provides authors with the option to define citation tags for readability. As presented in Table 1, Manubot processes citation metadata and exports it to the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, a widely recognized open standard supported by numerous reference managers. However, the challenge of invalid CSL data from external resources, which can cause downstream citation processing errors, has been noted. To mitigate this, Manubot is designed to remove such invalid fields according to the CSL Data specification.

This manuscript introduces Manubot, a tool designed to streamline and simplify citation processes. As detailed in Table @tbl:citations, Manubot supports various identifiers and offers a before-and-after comparison of example citations. A unique feature of Manubot is its ability to allow authors to define optional citation tags, offering short, readable alternatives to traditional citation identifiers. Furthermore, Manubot exports citation metadata to the widely supported Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, an open standard recognized by numerous reference managers. However, it is important to note that Manubot sometimes encounters invalid CSL Data from external resources, which can lead to errors with downstream citation processors like pandoc-citeproc. To mitigate this, Manubot has been designed to remove invalid fields in accordance with the CSL Data specification. In conclusion, Manubot presents a significant advancement in citation management, helping authors navigate the often complex and time-consuming process of referencing, while addressing the potential issue of invalid data. This innovation has broader implications for the scientific community, potentially transforming the way citations are managed and processed.",

Manubot, a software designed to address this issue, allows authors to define citation tags, offering a more readable alternative to citation identifiers, as illustrated in Table @tbl:citations. This software exports citation metadata to the widely supported open standard, Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items, which is compatible with numerous reference managers. However, the use of external resources can sometimes lead to invalid CSL Data, causing downstream citation processing errors. In response to this, Manubot has been developed to automatically remove any invalid fields in accordance with the CSL Data specification, thereby enhancing the reproducibility and provenance of collaborative writing. This advancement in handling citation metadata not only streamlines the writing process but also contributes to the broader goals of open science by improving the reliability and efficiency of collaborative research.",

The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Table @tbl:citations presents the supported identifiers and example citations before and after Manubot processing.

This study seeks to address this gap by introducing Manubot, a novel method for handling citations. Table @tbl:citations demonstrates how Manubot supports a variety of identifiers and can transform citations before and after processing. Authors also have the option to define citation tags, offering a more readable alternative to citation identifiers. Manubot exports citation metadata to the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, an open standard widely supported by reference managers. However, issues can arise when Manubot receives invalid CSL Data from external resources, which can disrupt downstream citation processors such as pandoc-citeproc. To mitigate this, Manubot is designed to remove invalid fields in accordance with the CSL Data specification. The introduction of Manubot presents a significant stride forward in the academic writing process, offering a more streamlined, accessible approach to citations and potentially advancing the broader field of academic writing.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. \"here we\") first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\"). If any part of the C-C-C scheme is missing, put an HTML comment in the place where it belongs with its name, so I can fill it in.\n\nInput paragraph: Table @tbl:citations presents the supported identifiers and example citations before and after Manubot processing. Authors can optionally define citation tags to provide short readable alternatives to the citation identifiers. Citation metadata is exported to the [Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items](http://citeproc-js.readthedocs.io/en/latest/csl-json/markup.html#items) format, an open standard that is widely supported by reference managers [@doi:10.1007/978-3-319-00026-8_8; @doi:10.1080/02763869.2012.641841].

Our manuscript addresses this gap by introducing Manubot, a tool designed to streamline the citation process. As detailed in Table @tbl:citations, Manubot supports various identifiers and provides the option for authors to define citation tags for readability. The tool exports citation metadata to the Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items format, a widely accepted open standard among reference managers. However, Manubot encounters occasional issues with invalid CSL Data from external resources, leading to errors with downstream citation processors such as pandoc-citeproc. To rectify this, Manubot has been designed to remove invalid fields in accordance with the CSL Data specification. This innovative approach to handling citations not only addresses the immediate problem of invalid data but also contributes to the larger goal of improving reproducibility and provenance in open science writing.",

Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers.

There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. \"broader significance\").\n\nInput paragraph: Table @tbl:citations presents the supported identifiers and example citations before and after Manubot processing.

Citation metadata is exported to the [Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data Items](http://citeproc-js.readthedocs.io/en/latest/csl-json/markup.html#items) format, an open standard that is widely supported by reference managers [@doi:10.1007/978-3-319-00026-8_8; @doi:10.1080/02763869.2012.641841]. However, sometimes external resources provide Manubot with invalid CSL Data, which can cause errors with downstream citation processors, such as [pandoc-citeproc](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-citeproc). Therefore, Manubot removes invalid fields according to the [CSL Data specification](https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema).\n\nRevised paragraph:",
