          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Open collaborative
          writing with Manubot' and keywords 'manuscript, open science,
          collaborative, writing, reproducibility, provenance, software, git,
          html.' Revise the following methods of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: In cases where automatic retrieval of metadata fails
          or produces incorrect references --- which is most common for URL
          citations --- users can manually provide the correct metadata using
          common reference formats. Manual metadata also supports references
          without standard identifiers, such as print-only newspaper articles.
          Table @tbl:citations presents the supported identifiers and example
          citations before and after Manubot processing. Authors can optionally
          define citation tags to provide short readable alternatives to the
          citation identifiers. Citation metadata is exported to the [Citation

          Manubot includes an additional layer of citation processing, currently

          as the title, authors, and publication date.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Open collaborative
          writing with Manubot' and keywords 'manuscript, open science,
          collaborative, writing, reproducibility, provenance, software, git,
          html.' Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has
          a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The
          revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as
          follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap
          the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by
          introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is
          situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open
          question that the research answers. A successful context section
          distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
          state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
          literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
          connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The
          content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel method or
          approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive
          summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results
          to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context
          portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that
          highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g.
          "broader significance").

        context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
        portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
        first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
        which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
        narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers.
        A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions
        from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the
        current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.
        the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The
        content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel method or
        approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive
        summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to
        answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.
        There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how
        this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. "broader
        significance").


        Input paragraph: In cases where automatic retrieval of metadata fails or
        produces incorrect references --- which is most common for URL citations
        --- users can manually provide the correct metadata using common
        reference formats. Manual metadata also supports references without
        standard identifiers, such as print-only newspaper articles. Table
        @tbl:citations presents the supported identifiers and example citations
        before and after Manubot processing. Authors can optionally define
        citation tags to provide short readable alternatives to the citation
        identifiers. Citation metadata is exported to the [Citation Style
        Language (CSL) JSON Data

        However, sometimes external resources provide Manubot with invalid CSL
        Data, which can cause errors with downstream citation processors, such
        as
        [pandoc-citeproc](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-citeproc).
        Therefore, Manubot removes invalid fields according to the [CSL Data
        specification](https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema).
        Manubot includes an additional layer of citation processing, currently
        unique to the system. All citations point to a standard identifier, for
        which Manubot automatically retrieves bibliographic metadata such as the
        title, authors, and publication date.

        manuscript.


        Input paragraph: In cases where automatic retrieval of metadata fails or
        produces incorrect references --- which is most common for URL citations
        --- users can manually provide the correct metadata using common
        reference formats. Manual metadata also supports references without
        standard identifiers, such as print-only newspaper articles. Table
        @tbl:citations presents the supported identifiers and example citations
        before and after Manubot processing. Authors can optionally define
        citation tags to provide short readable alternatives to the citation
        identifiers. Citation metadata is exported to the [Citation Style
        Language (CSL) JSON Data
        Items](http://citeproc-js.readthedocs.io/en/latest/csl-json/markup.html#items)

        However, sometimes external resources provide Manubot with invalid CSL
        Data, which can cause errors with downstream citation processors, such
        as
        [pandoc-citeproc](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-citeproc).
        Therefore, Manubot removes invalid fields according to the [CSL Data
        specification](https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema).
        Manubot includes an additional layer of citation processing, currently
        unique to the system. All citations point to a standard identifier, for
        which Manubot automatically retrieves bibliographic metadata such as the
        title, authors, and publication date.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Open collaborative
          writing with Manubot' and keywords 'manuscript, open science,
          collaborative, writing, reproducibility, provenance, software, git,
          html.' Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has
          a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The
          revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as
          follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap
          the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by
          introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is
          situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open
          question that the research answers. A successful context section
          distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
          state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
          literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
          connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The
          content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel method or
          approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive
          summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results
          to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context
          portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that
          highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g.
          "broader significance").

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following methods of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance"). If any part of
          the C-C-C scheme is missing, put an HTML comment in the place where it
          belongs with its name, so I can fill it in.


          Input paragraph: In cases where automatic retrieval of metadata fails
          or produces incorrect references --- which is most common for URL
          citations --- users can manually provide the correct metadata using
          common reference formats. Manual metadata also supports references
          without standard identifiers, such as print-only newspaper articles.
          Table @tbl:citations presents the supported identifiers and example
          citations before and after Manubot processing. Authors can optionally
          define citation tags to provide short readable alternatives to the
          citation identifiers. Citation metadata is exported to the [Citation
          Style Language (CSL) JSON Data
          Items](http://citeproc-js.readthedocs.io/en/latest/csl-json/markup.html#items)

          resources provide Manubot with invalid CSL Data, which can cause
          errors with downstream citation processors, such as
          [pandoc-citeproc](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-citeproc).
          Therefore, Manubot removes invalid fields according to the [CSL Data
          specification](https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema).
          Manubot includes an additional layer of citation processing, currently
          unique to the system. All citations point to a standard identifier,
          for which Manubot automatically retrieves bibliographic metadata such
          as the title, authors, and publication date.

          a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The
          revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as
          follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap
          the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by
          introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is
          situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open
          question that the research answers. A successful context section
          distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
          state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
          literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
          connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The
          content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel method or
          approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive
          summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results
          to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context
          portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that
          highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g.
          "broader significance").

        in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
        narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers.
        A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions
        from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the
        current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.
        the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The
        content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel method or
        approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive
        summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to
        answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.
        There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how
        this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. "broader
        significance"). If any part of the C-C-C scheme is missing, put an HTML
        comment in the place where it belongs with its name, so I can fill it
        in.


        Input paragraph: In cases where automatic retrieval of metadata fails or
        produces incorrect references --- which is most common for URL citations
        --- users can manually provide the correct metadata using common
        reference formats. Manual metadata also supports references without
        standard identifiers, such as print-only newspaper articles. Table
        @tbl:citations presents the supported identifiers and example citations
        before and after Manubot processing. Authors can optionally define
        citation tags to provide short readable alternatives to the citation
        identifiers. Citation metadata is exported to the [Citation Style

        Data, which can cause errors with downstream citation processors, such

          Input paragraph: In cases where automatic retrieval of metadata fails
          or produces incorrect references --- which is most common for URL
          citations --- users can manually provide the correct metadata using
          common reference formats. Manual metadata also supports references
          without standard identifiers, such as print-only newspaper articles.
          Table @tbl:citations presents the supported identifiers and example
          citations before and after Manubot processing. Authors can optionally
          define citation tags to provide short readable alternatives to the
          citation identifiers. Citation metadata is exported to the [Citation
          Style Language (CSL) JSON Data

        copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript.
        Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear
        sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should
        follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
        context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill.
        The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field
        in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
        narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers.
        A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions
        from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the
        current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.
        the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The
        content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel method or
        approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive
        summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to
        answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.
        There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how
        this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. "broader
        significance"). If any part of the C-C-C scheme is missing, put an HTML
        comment in the place where it belongs with its name, so I can fill it
        in.


        Input paragraph: In cases where automatic retrieval of metadata fails or
        produces incorrect references --- which is most common for URL citations
        --- users can manually provide the correct metadata using common
        reference formats. Manual metadata also supports references without
        standard identifiers, such as print-only newspaper articles. Table
        @tbl:citations presents the supported identifiers and example citations
        before and after Manubot processing. Authors can optionally define
        citation tags to provide short readable alternatives to the citation
        identifiers. Citation metadata is exported to the [Citation Style
        Language (CSL) JSON Data
        Items](http://citeproc-js.readthedocs.io/en/latest/csl-json/markup.html#items)

        However, sometimes external resources provide Manubot with invalid CSL
        Data, which can cause errors with downstream citation processors, such
        as
        [pandoc-citeproc](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-citeproc).
        Therefore, Manubot removes invalid fields according to the [CSL Data
        specification](https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema).
        Manubot includes an additional layer of citation processing, currently
        unique to the system. All citations point to a standard identifier, for
        which Manubot automatically retrieves bibliographic metadata such as the
        title, authors, and publication date.

        answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.

          writing with Manubot' and keywords 'manuscript, open science,

          a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The
          revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as
          follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap
          the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by
          introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is
          situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open
          question that the research answers. A successful context section
          distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
          state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
          literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
          connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The
          content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel method or
          approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive
          summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results
          to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context
          portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that
          highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g.
          "broader significance").

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following methods of
          this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in
          a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance"). If any part of
          the C-C-C scheme is missing, put an HTML comment in the place where it
          belongs with its name, so I can fill it in.


          Input paragraph: Table @tbl:citations presents the supported
          identifiers and example citations before and after Manubot processing.
          Authors can optionally define citation tags to provide short readable
          alternatives to the citation identifiers. Citation metadata is
          exported to the [Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data

          the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by
          introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is
          situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open
          question that the research answers. A successful context section
          distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
          state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
          literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
          connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The
          content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel method or
          approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive
          summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results
          to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context
          portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that
          highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g.
          "broader significance").


          Input paragraph: Table @tbl:citations presents the supported
          identifiers and example citations before and after Manubot processing.
          Authors can optionally define citation tags to provide short readable
          alternatives to the citation identifiers. Citation metadata is
          exported to the [Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data

          a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The
          revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as
          follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap
          the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by
          introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is
          situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open
          question that the research answers. A successful context section
          distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
          state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
          literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
          connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The
          content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel method or
          approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive
          summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results
          to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context
          portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that
          highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g.
          "broader significance").

          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance"). If any part of
          the C-C-C scheme is missing, put an HTML comment in the place where it
          belongs with its name, so I can fill it in.


          Input paragraph: Table @tbl:citations presents the supported
          identifiers and example citations before and after Manubot processing.
          Authors can optionally define citation tags to provide short readable
          alternatives to the citation identifiers. Citation metadata is
          exported to the [Citation Style Language (CSL) JSON Data

          errors with downstream citation processors, such as

          Input paragraph: Table @tbl:citations presents the supported
          identifiers and example citations before and after Manubot processing.
          Authors can optionally define citation tags to provide short readable
          alternatives to the citation identifiers. Citation metadata is

          a clear sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The
          revision should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as
          follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what gap
          the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by
          introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research is
          situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open
          question that the research answers. A successful context section
          distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
          state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
          literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
          connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The
          content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel method or
          approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive
          summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results
          to answer the question that was posed at the end of the context
          portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that
          highlights how this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g.
          "broader significance").

        Revise the following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear
        sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision should
        follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
        context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill.
        The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field
        in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
        narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answers.
        A successful context section distinguishes the research’s contributions
        from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the
        current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e.
        the connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2) The
        content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel method or
        approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an executive
        summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to
        answer the question that was posed at the end of the context portion.
        There may be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how
        this conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. "broader
        significance"). If any part of the C-C-C scheme is missing, put an HTML
        comment in the place where it belongs with its name, so I can fill it
        in.

              Manubot includes an additional layer of citation processing,
              currently unique to the system. All citations point to a standard
              identifier, for which Manubot automatically retrieves
              bibliographic metadata such as the title, authors, and publication

              open question that the research answers. A successful context
              section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the
              current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the
              current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters
              (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader
              context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes
              the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then
              presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
              portion interprets the results to answer the question that was
              posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second
              part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion
              moves the broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in

              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The

              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance"). If any part of the
              C-C-C scheme is missing, put an HTML comment in the place where it
              belongs with its name, so I can fill it in.


              Input paragraph: In cases where automatic retrieval of metadata
              fails or produces incorrect references --- which is most common
              for URL citations --- users can manually provide the correct
              metadata using common reference formats. Manual metadata also
              supports references without standard identifiers, such as
              print-only newspaper articles. Table @tbl:citations presents the
              supported identifiers and example citations before and after
              Manubot processing. Authors can optionally define citation tags to
              provide short readable alternatives to the citation identifiers.
              Citation metadata is exported to the [Citation Style Language
              (CSL) JSON Data
              Items](http://citeproc-js.readthedocs.io/en/latest/csl-json/markup.html#items)
              format, an open standard that is widely supported by reference
              managers [@doi:10.1007/978-3-319-00026-8_8;
              @doi:10.1080/02763869.2012.641841]. However, sometimes external
              resources provide Manubot with invalid CSL Data, which can cause
              errors with downstream citation processors, such as
              [pandoc-citeproc](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-citeproc).
              Therefore, Manubot removes invalid fields according to the [CSL
              Data
              specification](https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema).
              Manubot includes an additional layer of citation processing,
              currently unique to the system. All citations point to a standard
              identifier, for which Manubot automatically retrieves
              bibliographic metadata such as the title, authors, and publication
              date.

              and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap
              and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we")
              first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill
              the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The
              conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question
              that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a
              second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this

              following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear
              sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision
              should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as
              follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what
              gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by
              introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research
              is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the
              open question that the research answers. A successful context
              section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the
              current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the
              current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters
              (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader
              context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes
              the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then
              presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
              portion interprets the results to answer the question that was
              posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second
              part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion
              moves the broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              reproducibility, provenance, software, git, html.' Revise the
              following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear
              sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision
              should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as
              follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what
              gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by
              introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research
              is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the
              open question that the research answers. A successful context
              section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the
              current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the
              current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters
              (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader
              context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes
              the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then
              presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
              portion interprets the results to answer the question that was
              posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second
              part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion
              moves the broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").


              Input paragraph: In cases where automatic retrieval of metadata
              fails or produces incorrect references --- which is most common
              for URL citations --- users can manually provide the correct
              metadata using common reference formats. Manual metadata also
              supports references without standard identifiers, such as
              print-only newspaper articles. Table @tbl:citations presents the
              supported identifiers and example citations before and after
              Manubot processing. Authors can optionally define citation tags to
              provide short readable alternatives to the citation identifiers.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following methods
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance"). If any part of the
              C-C-C scheme is missing, put an HTML comment in the place where it
              belongs with its name, so I can fill it in.

              paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion
              (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to
              the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence
              orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the
              manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed
              until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A
              successful context section distinguishes the research’s
              contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating
              what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap)
              and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap
              and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we")
              first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill
              the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The
              conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question
              that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a
              second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this
              conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. "broader
              significance"). If any part of the C-C-C scheme is missing, put an
              HTML comment in the place where it belongs with its name, so I can

              open question that the research answers. A successful context
              section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the
              current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the
              current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters
              (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader
              context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes
              the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then
              presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
              portion interprets the results to answer the question that was
              posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second
              part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion
              moves the broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              collaborative, writing, reproducibility, provenance, software,
              git, html.' Revise the following methods of this manuscript so
              that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript. Revise the following methods
              of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence structure and
              fits in a single paragraph. The revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader

              Input paragraph: In cases where automatic retrieval of metadata
              fails or produces incorrect references --- which is most common
              for URL citations --- users can manually provide the correct
              metadata using common reference formats. Manual metadata also
              supports references without standard identifiers, such as
              print-only newspaper articles. Table @tbl:citations presents the
              supported identifiers and example citations before and after
              Manubot processing. Authors can optionally define citation tags to
              provide short readable alternatives to the citation identifiers.

              following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear
              sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision
              should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as
              follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what
              gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by
              introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research
              is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the
              open question that the research answers. A successful context
              section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the
              current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the
              current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters
              (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader
              context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes
              the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then
              presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
              portion interprets the results to answer the question that was
              posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second
              part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion
              moves the broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what
              gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by
              introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research
              is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the
              open question that the research answers. A successful context
              section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the
              current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the
              current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters
              (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader
              context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes
              the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then
              presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
              portion interprets the results to answer the question that was
              posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second
              part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion
              moves the broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear
              sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision
              should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as
              follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what
              gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by
              introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research
              is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the
              open question that the research answers. A successful context
              section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the
              current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the
              current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters
              (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader
              context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes
              the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then
              presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
              portion interprets the results to answer the question that was
              posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second
              part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion
              moves the broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              following methods of this manuscript so that it has a clear
              sentence structure and fits in a single paragraph. The revision
              should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as
              follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what
              gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by
              introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research
              is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the
              open question that the research answers. A successful context
              section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the
              current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the
              current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters
              (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader
              context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes
              the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then
              presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
              portion interprets the results to answer the question that was
              posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second
              part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion
              moves the broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance"). If any part of the
              C-C-C scheme is missing, put an HTML comment in the place where it
              belongs with its name, so I can fill it in.

              and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we")
              first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill
              the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The

              gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by
              introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research
              is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the
              open question that the research answers. A successful context
              section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the
              current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the
              current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters
              (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader
              context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes
              the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then
              presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
              portion interprets the results to answer the question that was
              posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second
              part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion
              moves the broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              collaborative, writing, reproducibility, provenance, software,
              git, html.' Revise the following methods of this manuscript so
              that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single
              paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion
              (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to
              the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence
              orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the
              manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed
              until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A
              successful context section distinguishes the research’s
              contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating
              what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap)
              and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap
              and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we")
              first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill
              the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The
              conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question
              that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a
              second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this

              should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as
              follows: 1) The context portion communicates to the reader what
              gap the paper will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by
              introducing the broader field in which the manuscript's research
              is situated. Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the
              open question that the research answers. A successful context
              section distinguishes the research’s contributions from the
              current state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the
              current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters
              (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the broader
              context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes
              the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then
              presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
              portion interprets the results to answer the question that was
              posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a second
              part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion
              moves the broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Open collaborative
              writing with Manubot' and keywords 'manuscript, open science,
              collaborative, writing, reproducibility, provenance, software,
              git, html.' Revise the following methods of this manuscript so
              that it has a clear sentence structure and fits in a single
              paragraph. The revision should follow a context-content-conclusion
              (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context portion communicates to
              the reader what gap the paper will fill. The first sentence
              orients the reader by introducing the broader field in which the
              manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is narrowed
              until it lands on the open question that the research answers. A
              successful context section distinguishes the research’s
              contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating
              what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap)
              and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap
              and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we")
              first describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill
              the gap, then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The
              conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the question
              that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may be a
              second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this
              conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. "broader
              significance").
