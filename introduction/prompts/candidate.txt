You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear in formats like "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.
