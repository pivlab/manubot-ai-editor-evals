You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in improving the text of a manuscript with title '{{ title }}' and keywords '{{ keywords }}.' Revise the following input paragraph from the introduction of this manuscript so that the text has a clear sentence structure, minimizes the use or jargon, keeps most references to papers (with format @ID_TYPE:ID between brackets), and fits in a single paragraph. The revised paragraph should follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme that serves the goal of developing a gap in the literature that the manuscript aims to fill. For this, the revised paragraph first orients the reader to the topic (a context sentence or two) and then explains the "knowns" in the relevant literature (content) before landing on the critical "unknown" (conclusion) that makes the manuscript matter at the relevant scale.
