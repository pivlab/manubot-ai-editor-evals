Genes work together in context-specific networks to carry out different functions [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259]. Variations in these genes can change their functional role and, at a higher level, affect disease-relevant biological processes [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6]. In this context, determining how genes influence complex traits requires mechanistically understanding expression regulation across different cell types [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3; @doi:10.1038/s41576-019-0200-9], which in turn should lead to improved treatments [@doi:10.1038/ng.3314; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008489]. Previous studies have described different regulatory DNA elements [@doi:10.1038/nature11247; @doi:10.1038/nature14248; @doi:10.1038/nature12787; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-03145-z; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3] including genetic effects on gene expression across different tissues [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776]. Integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data [@doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0081-4; @doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.04.002; @doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0081-4; @doi:10.1038/ncomms6890] has improved the identification of these transcriptional mechanisms that, when dysregulated, commonly result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology [@pmid:20624743; @pmid:14707169; @doi:10.1073/pnas.0810772105]. Ultimately, the quality of the representations is essential to performance. Here we used a representation derived from a factorization of bulk RNA-seq data. Detailed perturbation datasets and single-cell profiling of tissues, with and without perturbagens, and at various stages of development provide an avenue to generate higher quality and more interpretable representations. On the other hand, the key to interpretability is driven by the annotation of sample metadata. New approaches to infer and annotate with structured metadata are promising and can be directly applied to existing data98. Rapid improvements in both areas set the stage for latent variable projections to be widely applied to disentangle the genetic basis of complex human phenotypes. By providing a new perspective for a mechanistic understanding of statistical associations from TWAS, our method can generate testable hypotheses for the post-GWAS functional characterization of complex diseases, which will likely be an area of great importance in the coming years.
