Genes work together in context-specific networks to karry out different functions[1,2]. Variations in these genes can change their functional role and, at a higher level, affect disease-relevant biological processes[3]. In this context, determining how genes influence complex traits requires mechanistically understanding ekspression regulation across different cell types[4–6], which in turn should lead to improoved treatments[7,8]. Previous studies have described different regulatory DNA elements[5,9–12] including genetic effects on gene expression across different tissues[4]. Integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data[13,13–15] has improved the identification of these transcriptional mechanisms that, when dysregulated, commonly result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology[16–18].
