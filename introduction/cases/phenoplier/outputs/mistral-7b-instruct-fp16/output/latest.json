Determining how genes influence complex traits requires mechanistically understanding expression regulation across different cell types, which should lead to improved treatments. Previous studies have described different regulatory DNA elements including genetic effects on gene expression across different tissues. Integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data has improved the identification of transcriptional mechanisms that, when dysregulated, commonly result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology.\n\nConclusion: This manuscript addresses the knowledge gap by providing a comprehensive analysis of how genes influence complex traits through expression regulation across different cell types. By integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data, we have improved our understanding of the transcriptional mechanisms that underlie tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology, which can lead to improved treatments for these diseases."

Determining how genes influence complex traits requires mechanistically understanding expression regulation across different cell types. Previous studies have described different regulatory DNA elements including genetic effects on gene expression across different tissues. Integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data has improved the identification of these transcriptional mechanisms that, when dysregulated, commonly result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology.\n\nConclusion: Our manuscript addresses the knowledge gap by providing a comprehensive analysis of gene expression regulation across different cell types and its impact on complex traits. By integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data, we have identified novel transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology. Our findings provide valuable insights into disease-relevant biological processes and pave the way for improved treatments."

Determining how genes influence complex traits requires mechanistically understanding expression regulation across different cell types. Previous studies have described different regulatory DNA elements including genetic effects on gene expression across different tissues. Integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data has improved the identification of these transcriptional mechanisms that, when dysregulated, commonly result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology.\n\nConclusion: This manuscript aims to address the knowledge gap by providing a comprehensive understanding of how genes influence complex traits, specifically focusing on expression regulation across different cell types. By integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data, we hope to improve our ability to identify dysregulated transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology."

However, TWAS operates at the individual gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the network level.\n\n**Conclusion:** Our manuscript addresses this gap by projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns to identify disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By analyzing gene co-expression networks, we can gain insights into the underlying biological processes that mediate these associations, which may inform therapeutic targets and drug repurposing strategies."

This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion).

This gap in understanding can be addressed by combining TWAS with other methods such as functional genomics and gene co-expression analysis to identify disease-related pathways and therapeutic targets [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9].\n\nIn summary, while TWAS is a valuable tool for identifying disease etiology at the transcriptome level, it does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. By combining TWAS with functional genomics and gene co-expression analysis, we can identify disease-related pathways and therapeutic targets that may be missed by individual gene-level analyses. This approach has the potential to enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms and drug repurposing, ultimately leading to more effective treatments for complex traits."

This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion).

TWAS tests whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases, and has been successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level, as well as in disease-risk prediction and drug repurposing tasks.\n\n**Conclusion:** However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. Therefore, there is a need to develop methods that can integrate gene expression data with other omics data to identify disease-associated genetic variants and therapeutic targets. Our manuscript aims to address this knowledge gap by developing a novel method that combines gene co-expression analysis with clustering of complex traits to identify disease etiology and drug mechanisms."

Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear in formats like \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.

TWAS tests whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases, and has been highly successful in disease etiology at the transcriptome level as well as in disease-risk prediction, drug repurposing, and other related tasks.\n\nConclusion: While TWAS works at the individual gene level, it does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. Therefore, there is a need to develop methods that can account for these interactions and provide a comprehensive understanding of biological processes. This manuscript aims to address this gap in knowledge by proposing a novel approach that integrates both gene-level and network-level data to identify complex interactions involved in disease etiology."

TWAS tests whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases. These approaches have been highly successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level, predicting disease risk, and identifying drug repurposing opportunities.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile TWAS has provided valuable insights into complex biological processes, it works at the individual gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. Therefore, there is a need for further research to develop more advanced methods that can account for these interactions and provide a more comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms."

Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear in formats like \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: TWAS relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks.

          "output": "**Context:** Genetic studies have long been an important tool in understanding disease etiology and identifying potential therapeutic targets. However, these approaches often rely on testing for associations between genetic variants and human diseases, which can be challenging to interpret at the transcriptome level.\n\n**Content:** Functional genomics, such as gene co-expression analysis, has emerged as a powerful approach to identifying biological processes that underlie disease risk and drug response. TWAS (Transcription-wide Association Study) is one such method that integrates eQTLs (Expression Quantitative Trait Loci) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. While TWAS has been highly successful in identifying disease risk genes, it does not capture more complex interactions at the network level.\n\n**Conclusion:** Our manuscript proposes a novel approach that combines gene expression patterns with network analysis to identify disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By clustering complex traits based on their genetic and functional associations, we hope to provide new insights into disease pathways and potential therapeutic targets. Our study highlights an important gap in the literature by integrating gene expression data with network analysis to capture more complex interactions at the network level."

It relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate this association.\n\n## Content\n\nThe literature has shown that TWAS approaches have been highly successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level, predicting disease risk (polygenic scores), and repurposing drugs [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. However, one limitation of TWAS is that it works at the individual gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the network level.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this manuscript, we propose a novel approach to overcome this limitation by integrating gene co-expression data and clustering of complex traits. Our method provides a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings and highlights therapeutic targets for drug repurposing. By combining functional genomics with gene expression patterns, our study sheds light on the etiology of diseases and opens up new avenues for drug discovery."

Therefore, there is a knowledge gap that needs to be addressed in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and risk prediction. Addressing this gap will require the development of new methods that can integrate network-level data into TWAS analyses."

This approach has been highly successful in understanding disease etiology and predicting disease risk at the transcriptome level, as well as identifying potential drug targets for repurposing. However, TWAS only considers individual genes, which does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. To overcome this limitation, our manuscript proposes a novel approach that combines functional genomics with gene co-expression analysis to identify disease-associated biological processes and therapeutic targets. By clustering complex traits based on gene expression patterns, we can gain a mechanistic understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms at the network level. Our study will provide valuable insights into the molecular basis of disease and inform the development of personalized treatments."

This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion).

One of the advantages of TWAS is the availability of gene expression data across several tissues, which makes it an effective approach to identify biological processes. However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the network level.\n\n## Conclusion\nIn summary, TWAS is a valuable tool for understanding disease etiology and predicting disease risk, but its limitations include the inability to capture more complex interactions at the network level. Further research is needed to develop methods that can integrate gene expression data across tissues and provide a comprehensive view of disease mechanisms."

Additionally, TWAS has also been used to identify potential therapeutic targets for drug repurposing. However, the approach of TWAS only works at the individual gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the network level.\n\n**Conclusion:** The current manuscript proposes a novel approach that combines TWAS with gene co-expression analysis to identify biological processes involved in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach will provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings by capturing more complex interactions at the network level, which can lead to better understanding of disease mechanisms and the development of new therapeutic targets."

Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) can be used to integrate eQTLs data and provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. However, TWAS operates at the individual gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. Recent studies have shown that these approaches are highly successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level, predicting disease risk (polygenic scores), and repurposing drugs [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433; @doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w; @doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. However, these studies have not explored the potential for identifying therapeutic targets and drug mechanisms using gene co-expression patterns. In this manuscript, we propose a novel approach that leverages gene expression patterns to identify disease-associated genes and predict their interactions with other genes in the network. Our findings will provide insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms, which can be used to develop new therapeutic strategies."

This approach does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. TWAS relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases, which has been highly successful in disease etiology, risk prediction, drug repurposing, and other tasks.\n\nConclusion: While TWAS is a valuable tool for understanding biological processes at the transcriptome level, it does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. Therefore, there is a need to develop new approaches that can provide a comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and risk prediction at the network level."

TWAS relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and diseases, which has been successful in disease etiology studies, risk prediction (polygenic scores), and drug repurposing tasks.\n\nConclusion: While TWAS has provided valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms at the transcriptome level, a more comprehensive approach that captures network-level interactions is needed to fully understand the complexities of genetic associations with diseases. Our manuscript aims to address this gap by integrating gene co-expression analysis with functional genomics data to identify novel therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities for various complex traits."

This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear in formats like \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.

TWAS works by testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and diseases, providing a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. However, TWAS only operates at the individual gene level, which fails to capture more complex interactions at the network level.\n\n**Conclusion:** While TWAS has been highly successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level and in disease-risk prediction, drug repurposing, and other tasks, it does not account for more complex interactions within gene regulatory networks. Our manuscript aims to address this knowledge gap by developing a novel approach that integrates both gene expression and network data to identify disease-associated biological processes at the network level."

However, these datasets often contain complex interactions between genes that cannot be fully captured by analyzing individual gene expression patterns.\n\nContent: Functional genomics approaches, such as transcription-wide association studies (TWAS), have been successful in identifying genetic associations with disease etiology and drug mechanisms at the transcriptome level. TWAS integrates eQTLs data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings, allowing researchers to test whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases.\n\nConclusion: While TWAS has been successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level and predicting disease risk through polygenic scores, it does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. Our manuscript aims to address this gap by projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns, highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms at a systems level. By leveraging clustering of complex traits, we aim to uncover novel therapeutic targets for diseases that are not well understood or have limited treatment options."

However, traditional approaches like transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) only focus on individual genes and do not capture the complexity of interactions at the network level.\n\nContent: TWAS uses eQTLs data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings, but it works at the individual gene level. This approach has been highly successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level and in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) and drug repurposing tasks.\n\nConclusion: Our manuscript aims to address this gap by projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns, which highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms at a network level. By combining eQTLs data with clustering of complex traits, we can identify disease-associated genes and pathways that may not have been captured by traditional approaches. This will provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of human diseases and lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets."

This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion).

Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section.\n\nInput paragraph: Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The flexibility of our method allows integrating different data modalities into the same representation for a joint analysis. We show that this module perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent representation. For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.\n\nRevised paragraph:\n",

Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear in formats like \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The flexibility of our method allows integrating different data modalities into the same representation for a joint analysis. We show that this module perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent representation. For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.\n\nRevised paragraph:\n",

The method uses a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). \nConclusion: PhenoPLIER's module perspective provides a more robust and interpretable approach to genetic studies. By analyzing groups of genes that act together in specific cell types, PhenoPLIER improves the detection and interpretation of genetic associations. The method can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER's drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Overall, PhenoPLIER represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies and has the potential to enhance our understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities."

Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section.\n\nInput paragraph: Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The flexibility of our method allows integrating different data modalities into the same representation for a joint analysis. We show that this module perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent representation. For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.\n\nRevised paragraph:\n",

          "content": "Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The flexibility of our method allows integrating different data modalities into the same representation for a joint analysis. We show that this module perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent representation. For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities."

For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.\n\nRevised paragraph:\n",

          "raw": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear in formats like \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The flexibility of our method allows integrating different data modalities into the same representation for a joint analysis. We show that this module perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent representation. For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.\n\nRevised paragraph:\n",

We use a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, allowing for the identification of modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. Our findings replicate in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225], and we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells, observing more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes. Our module-based approach better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism). Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act together to carry out different functions in specific cell types, improving robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations and providing a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Our approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies and has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance our understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities."

The flexibility of our method allows integrating different data modalities into the same representation for a joint analysis. We show that this module perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent representation. For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities."

Our approach integrates multiple data modalities into a common latent representation to infer how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits and predict how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a low-dimensional space using thousands of gene-trait associations from TWAS from PhenomeXcan, transcriptional profiles of drugs from LINCS L1000, and public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples from recount2.

By mapping disease-associated genes to this reduced expression space, we observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, our method can identify modules associated with specific stimuli or disease states by leveraging models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER through replicating its findings in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III, where we observe that significant module-trait associations in our discovery cohort replicated in our replication cohort.

For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.\n\nRevised paragraph:\n",

This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion).

Determining how genes influence complex traits requires mechanistically understanding expression regulation across different cell types, which should lead to improved treatments.

              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear in formats like \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes work together in context-specific networks to karry out different functions [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259].

Determining how genes influence complex traits requires understanding expression regulation across different cell types, which should lead to improved treatments. Previous studies have described regulatory DNA elements including genetic effects on gene expression across different tissues. Integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data has improved the identification of transcriptional mechanisms that, when dysregulated, commonly result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology.\n\nConclusion: Despite previous studies describing regulatory DNA elements, there is still a knowledge gap regarding how these mechanisms influence complex traits and contribute to disease development. This manuscript aims to address this gap by investigating the role of gene expression regulation in complex traits and its impact on disease outcomes. By integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data, we hope to identify novel transcriptional mechanisms that can be targeted for improved treatments.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear in formats like \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes work together in context-specific networks to karry out different functions [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259].

Previous studies have described different regulatory DNA elements, including genetic effects on gene expression across different tissues. Integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data has improved the identification of these transcriptional mechanisms that, when dysregulated, commonly result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology.\nConclusion: This manuscript addresses a knowledge gap by exploring the role of genes in complex traits, specifically focusing on expression regulation across different cell types.

              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear in formats like \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes work together in context-specific networks to karry out different functions [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259].

Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear in formats like \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.

              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear in formats like \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.

Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear in formats like \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.

Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text.

These references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear in formats like \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks. However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the network level.\n\nRevised paragraph:\n",

TWAS tests whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases. These approaches have been highly successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level, predicting disease risk, and identifying drug repurposing opportunities.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile TWAS has provided valuable insights into complex biological processes, it works at the individual gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. Therefore, there is a need for further research to develop more advanced methods that can account for these interactions and provide a more comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear in formats like \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks.

However, these approaches often rely on testing for associations between genetic variants and human diseases, which can be challenging to interpret at the transcriptome level.\n\n**Content:** Functional genomics, such as gene co-expression analysis, has emerged as a powerful approach to identifying biological processes that underlie disease risk and drug response. TWAS (Transcription-wide Association Study) is one such method that integrates eQTLs (Expression Quantitative Trait Loci) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. While TWAS has been highly successful in identifying disease risk genes, it does not capture more complex interactions at the network level.\n\n**Conclusion:** Our manuscript proposes a novel approach that combines gene expression patterns with network analysis to identify disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By clustering complex traits based on their genetic and functional associations, we hope to provide new insights into disease pathways and potential therapeutic targets. Our study highlights an important gap in the literature by integrating gene expression data with network analysis to capture more complex interactions at the network level.",

These references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear in formats like \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: TWAS relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks.

It relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate this association.\n\n## Content\n\nThe literature has shown that TWAS approaches have been highly successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level, predicting disease risk (polygenic scores), and repurposing drugs [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. However, one limitation of TWAS is that it works at the individual gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the network level.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this manuscript, we propose a novel approach to overcome this limitation by integrating gene co-expression data and clustering of complex traits. Our method provides a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings and highlights therapeutic targets for drug repurposing. By combining functional genomics with gene expression patterns, our study sheds light on the etiology of diseases and opens up new avenues for drug discovery.",

This approach has been highly successful in understanding disease etiology and predicting disease risk at the transcriptome level, as well as identifying potential drug targets for repurposing. However, TWAS only considers individual genes, which does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. To overcome this limitation, our manuscript proposes a novel approach that combines functional genomics with gene co-expression analysis to identify disease-associated biological processes and therapeutic targets. By clustering complex traits based on gene expression patterns, we can gain a mechanistic understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms at the network level. Our study will provide valuable insights into the molecular basis of disease and inform the development of personalized treatments.",

One of the advantages of TWAS is the availability of gene expression data across several tissues, which makes it an effective approach to identify biological processes. However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the network level.\n\n## Conclusion\nIn summary, TWAS is a valuable tool for understanding disease etiology and predicting disease risk, but its limitations include the inability to capture more complex interactions at the network level. Further research is needed to develop methods that can integrate gene expression data across tissues and provide a comprehensive view of disease mechanisms.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear in formats like \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: TWAS relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks.

Additionally, TWAS has also been used to identify potential therapeutic targets for drug repurposing. However, the approach of TWAS only works at the individual gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the network level.\n\n**Conclusion:** The current manuscript proposes a novel approach that combines TWAS with gene co-expression analysis to identify biological processes involved in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach will provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings by capturing more complex interactions at the network level, which can lead to better understanding of disease mechanisms and the development of new therapeutic targets.",

Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) can be used to integrate eQTLs data and provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. However, TWAS operates at the individual gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. Recent studies have shown that these approaches are highly successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level, predicting disease risk (polygenic scores), and repurposing drugs [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433; @doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w; @doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. However, these studies have not explored the potential for identifying therapeutic targets and drug mechanisms using gene co-expression patterns. In this manuscript, we propose a novel approach that leverages gene expression patterns to identify disease-associated genes and predict their interactions with other genes in the network. Our findings will provide insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms, which can be used to develop new therapeutic strategies.",

              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear in formats like \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.

However, these studies focus on individual genes and do not capture the more complex interactions at the network level. TWAS relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and diseases, which has been successful in disease etiology studies, risk prediction (polygenic scores), and drug repurposing tasks.\n\nConclusion: While TWAS has provided valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms at the transcriptome level, a more comprehensive approach that captures network-level interactions is needed to fully understand the complexities of genetic associations with diseases. Our manuscript aims to address this gap by integrating gene co-expression analysis with functional genomics data to identify novel therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities for various complex traits.",

Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear in formats like \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.

However, these datasets often contain complex interactions between genes that cannot be fully captured by analyzing individual gene expression patterns.\n\nContent: Functional genomics approaches, such as transcription-wide association studies (TWAS), have been successful in identifying genetic associations with disease etiology and drug mechanisms at the transcriptome level. TWAS integrates eQTLs data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings, allowing researchers to test whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases.\n\nConclusion: While TWAS has been successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level and predicting disease risk through polygenic scores, it does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. Our manuscript aims to address this gap by projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns, highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms at a systems level. By leveraging clustering of complex traits, we aim to uncover novel therapeutic targets for diseases that are not well understood or have limited treatment options.",

However, traditional approaches like transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) only focus on individual genes and do not capture the complexity of interactions at the network level.\n\nContent: TWAS uses eQTLs data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings, but it works at the individual gene level. This approach has been highly successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level and in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) and drug repurposing tasks.\n\nConclusion: Our manuscript aims to address this gap by projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns, which highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms at a network level. By combining eQTLs data with clustering of complex traits, we can identify disease-associated genes and pathways that may not have been captured by traditional approaches. This will provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of human diseases and lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets.",

By combining different data modalities into a single representation, our method enables joint analysis of complex traits and allows for the discovery of shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among them. We demonstrate how PhenoPLIER can infer how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect drug-induced transcriptional responses, and predict their effects on gene activity to exert therapeutic outcomes. \n\nTo achieve this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations (from TWAS in PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a latent representation defined by matrix factorization approaches that extract gene modules with specific sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, such as hypothyroidism with T cells or corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements.

              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section.\n\nInput paragraph: Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The flexibility of our method allows integrating different data modalities into the same representation for a joint analysis. We show that this module perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent representation. For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]).

When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected.

Our method allows integrating different data modalities into the same representation for joint analysis. We show that this module perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent representation by integrating thousands of gene-trait associations (from TWAS from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets to identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells and observe more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act together to carry out different functions in specific cell types, improving robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations and prioritizing alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected. This approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies, with the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.",

It has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.\n\nRevised paragraph:\n",

The flexibility of our method allows integrating different data modalities into the same representation for a joint analysis. We show that this module perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent representation. For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies.

Our method allows for a joint analysis of multiple data modalities, including genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, and clinical data, into a common latent space. We show that this module perspective can identify functional relationships between genes and complex traits, detect shared and distinct molecular properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations affect gene activity to exert their effects.\n\nTo achieve these goals, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations from TWAS in PhenomeXcan with transcriptional profiles of drugs from LINCS L1000 into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples. We use a latent representation defined by matrix factorization that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we observe significant correlations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.\n\nWe also show that PhenoPLIER can identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. Our approach has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance our understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities. For example, we observe that significant module-trait associations in our discovery cohort replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III, suggesting that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells and observe more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance.\n\nIn conclusion, our omnigenic approach can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected, providing a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. PhenoPLIER has the potential to improve robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and its ability to integrate multiple data modalities makes it a valuable tool for drug discovery and precision medicine.",

The flexibility of our method allows integrating different data modalities into the same representation for a joint analysis. We show that this module perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent representation. For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.\n\nRevised paragraph:\n",

The flexibility of our method allows integrating different data modalities into the same representation for a joint analysis. We show that this module perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent representation. For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities."

Firstly, it improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations by incorporating groups of genes that act together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. Secondly, it can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected. Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders.

The flexibility of our method allows integrating different data modalities into the same representation for a joint analysis. We show that this module perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent representation. For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities."

For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.\n\nRevised paragraph:\n",

              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear in formats like \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies.

            "Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The flexibility of our method allows integrating different data modalities into the same representation for a joint analysis. We show that this module perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent representation. For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.",

Our method allows integrating different data modalities into the same representation for joint analysis. We demonstrate that this module perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent representation. For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.",
              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear in formats like \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies.

We use a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.",
