          Gene networks work in context-specific ways to carry out different
          functions, and variations in these genes can alter their functional
          roles and affect disease-relevant biological processes. To understand
          how genes influence complex traits, we must mechanistically understand
          expression regulation across different cell types. Previous studies
          have described various regulatory DNA elements, including genetic
          effects on gene expression across different tissues. Integrating
          functional genomics data and GWAS data has improved the identification
          of these transcriptional mechanisms, which are commonly dysregulated
          in tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology.

          functional role and, at a higher level, affect disease-relevant

          Content: To understand how genes influence complex traits, it is
          necessary to mechanistically understand expression regulation across
          different cell types. Previous studies have described different
          regulatory DNA elements including genetic effects on gene expression
          across different tissues. Integrating functional genomics data and
          GWAS data has improved the identification of these transcriptional
          mechanisms that, when dysregulated, commonly result in tissue- and
          cell lineage-specific pathology.


          Conclusion: This manuscript aims to address a knowledge gap by
          projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns and
          identifying disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By analyzing gene
          co-expression networks across different cell types, we hope to uncover
          new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities. Our study
          will contribute to the clustering of complex traits by integrating
          functional genomics data and GWAS data, providing a more comprehensive
          understanding of how genes influence disease-relevant biological
          processes.

          functional genomics data and GWAS data has improved the identification
          of transcriptional mechanisms that, when dysregulated, commonly result
          in tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology.


          Conclusion: This manuscript addresses the knowledge gap by providing a
          comprehensive analysis of how genes influence complex traits through
          expression regulation across different cell types. By integrating
          functional genomics data and GWAS data, we have improved our
          understanding of the transcriptional mechanisms that underlie tissue-
          and cell lineage-specific pathology, which can lead to improved
          treatments for these diseases.

          genes influence complex traits requires understanding expression
          regulation across different cell types, which should lead to improved

          the role of gene expression regulation in complex traits and its
          impact on disease outcomes. By integrating functional genomics data
          and GWAS data, we hope to identify novel transcriptional mechanisms
          that can be targeted for improved treatments.

          Content: Variations in these genes can change their functional role
          and, at a higher level, affect disease-relevant biological processes.
          Determining how genes influence complex traits requires
          mechanistically understanding expression regulation across different
          cell types. Previous studies have described different regulatory DNA
          elements including genetic effects on gene expression across different
          tissues. Integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data has
          improved the identification of these transcriptional mechanisms that,
          when dysregulated, commonly result in tissue- and cell
          lineage-specific pathology.


          Conclusion: Our manuscript addresses the knowledge gap by providing a
          comprehensive analysis of gene expression regulation across different
          cell types and its impact on complex traits. By integrating functional
          genomics data and GWAS data, we have identified novel transcriptional
          mechanisms that contribute to tissue- and cell lineage-specific
          pathology. Our findings provide valuable insights into
          disease-relevant biological processes and pave the way for improved
          treatments.

          **Context:** Genes work together in networks to carry out different
          functions, and variations in these genes can affect disease-relevant
          biological processes.


          **Content:** Understanding how genes influence complex traits requires
          mechanistically understanding expression regulation across different
          cell types. Previous studies have described different regulatory DNA
          elements, including genetic effects on gene expression across
          different tissues. Integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data
          has improved the identification of these transcriptional mechanisms
          that, when dysregulated, commonly result in tissue- and cell
          lineage-specific pathology.


          **Conclusion:** This manuscript aims to project genetic associations
          through gene expression patterns, highlighting disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms. By integrating functional genomics data and GWAS
          data, we will identify these transcriptional mechanisms that, when
          dysregulated, commonly result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific
          pathology. This knowledge gap will lead to improved treatments for
          complex diseases.

          preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal
          changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles
          are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These references

          Content: Variations in these genes can change their functional role
          and, at a higher level, affect disease-relevant biological processes.
          Determining how genes influence complex traits requires
          mechanistically understanding expression regulation across different
          cell types. Previous studies have described different regulatory DNA
          elements including genetic effects on gene expression across different
          tissues. Integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data has
          improved the identification of these transcriptional mechanisms that,
          when dysregulated, commonly result in tissue- and cell
          lineage-specific pathology.


          Conclusion: Our manuscript addresses the knowledge gap by projecting
          genetic associations through gene expression patterns to highlight
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By doing so, we hope to enhance
          our understanding of complex traits and improve treatments for tissue-
          and cell lineage-specific diseases.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section.

          several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;

          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS
          relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms
          mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;

          approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in

          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks. However, TWAS works at the individual
          gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the
          network level.

          complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from
          the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and
          maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown
          formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure.
          This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences
          (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature
          (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge
          gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1)
          preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal
          changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles
          are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These references
          are crucial for academic integrity and may appear in formats like

          **Content:** To identify biological processes from this data, a
          powerful tool is transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which
          combines expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a
          mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS tests whether

          **Conclusion:** Our manuscript addresses this gap by projecting
          genetic associations through gene expression patterns to identify
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By analyzing gene co-expression
          networks, we can gain insights into the underlying biological
          processes that mediate these associations, which may inform
          therapeutic targets and drug repurposing strategies.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear in
          formats like "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;

          entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single,
          cohesive paragraph.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear in
          formats like "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;
          @pmid:31036433]", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the
          entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single,
          cohesive paragraph.

          However, TWAS operates at the individual gene level, which fails to
          capture more intricate interactions at the network level. Therefore,
          there is a knowledge gap that needs to be addressed by exploring the
          use of TWAS in combination with other approaches that can account for
          network effects. This approach could potentially enhance our
          understanding of disease mechanisms and facilitate the discovery of
          new therapeutic targets.

          mechanisms' with keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene

          In summary, while TWAS is a valuable tool for identifying disease
          etiology at the transcriptome level, it does not capture more complex
          interactions at the network level. By combining TWAS with functional
          genomics and gene co-expression analysis, we can identify
          disease-related pathways and therapeutic targets that may be missed by
          individual gene-level analyses. This approach has the potential to
          enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms and drug repurposing,
          ultimately leading to more effective treatments for complex traits.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a manuscript titled 'Projecting genetic associations through
          gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms' with keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene
          co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of
          complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from
          the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and
          maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown
          formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure.
          This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences
          (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature
          (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge
          gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1)
          preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal
          changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles
          are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These references
          are crucial for academic integrity and may appear in formats like
          "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]",
          and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision,
          following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.


          Input paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across
          several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify
          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS
          relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms
          mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases

          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these
          approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in
          disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)
          [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing
          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks. However, TWAS works at the individual
          gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the
          network level.

          **Context:** Gene expression data is now widely available across
          various tissues, providing an opportunity to identify biological
          processes that contribute to human diseases.


          **Content:** An effective approach for this task is transcription-wide
          association studies (TWAS), which integrates eQTLs data to provide a
          mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS tests whether
          perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association
          between genetic variants and human diseases, and has been successful
          in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level, as well
          as in disease-risk prediction and drug repurposing tasks.


          **Conclusion:** However, TWAS works at the individual gene level,
          which does not capture more complex interactions at the network level.
          Therefore, there is a need to develop methods that can integrate gene
          expression data with other omics data to identify disease-associated
          genetic variants and therapeutic targets. Our manuscript aims to
          address this knowledge gap by developing a novel method that combines
          gene co-expression analysis with clustering of complex traits to
          identify disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          Context: Gene expression data is available across various tissues,
          providing a rich source of information for studying biological
          processes.


          Content: The transcription-wide association study (TWAS) is an
          effective approach to identify these processes by integrating
          expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data. TWAS tests whether
          perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association
          between genetic variants and human diseases, and has been highly
          successful in disease etiology at the transcriptome level as well as
          in disease-risk prediction, drug repurposing, and other related tasks.


          Conclusion: While TWAS works at the individual gene level, it does not
          capture more complex interactions at the network level. Therefore,
          there is a need to develop methods that can account for these
          interactions and provide a comprehensive understanding of biological
          processes. This manuscript aims to address this gap in knowledge by
          proposing a novel approach that integrates both gene-level and
          network-level data to identify complex interactions involved in
          disease etiology.

          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify
          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS
          relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms
          mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;

          approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in

          Gene expression data is widely available across different tissues,
          providing a valuable resource for identifying biological processes
          involved in human diseases. Transcription-wide association studies
          (TWAS) leverage this information by integrating expression
          quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic
          interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS tests whether perturbations in

          mechanisms' with keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene
          co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of
          complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from
          the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and
          maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown
          formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure.
          This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences
          (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature
          (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge
          gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1)
          preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal
          changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles
          are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These references
          are crucial for academic integrity and may appear in formats like

          Gene expression data across multiple tissues is widely available, and
          an effective approach to identify biological processes is
          transcription-wide association studies (TWAS). This method integrates
          eQTLs data to provide a mechanistic interpretation of GWAS findings.
          TWAS tests whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate
          the association between genetic variants and human diseases. These
          approaches have been highly successful in understanding disease
          etiology at the transcriptome level, predicting disease risk
          (polygenic scores), and drug repurposing tasks. However, TWAS works at
          the individual gene level and does not capture more complex
          interactions at the network level. Our manuscript aims to fill this
          gap by using gene co-expression analysis to identify disease etiology
          and drug mechanisms through gene expression patterns.

          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These

          ## Context


          The availability of gene expression data across multiple tissues has
          provided a wealth of information for understanding biological
          processes and identifying disease risk factors.


          ## Content


          To effectively analyze this data, researchers have developed
          transcription-wide association studies (TWAS), which integrate
          expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a
          mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS tests whether
          perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association
          between genetic variants and human diseases. These approaches have
          been highly successful in understanding disease etiology at the
          transcriptome level, predicting disease risk, and identifying drug
          repurposing opportunities.


          ## Conclusion


          While TWAS has provided valuable insights into complex biological
          processes, it works at the individual gene level, which does not
          capture more complex interactions at the network level. Therefore,
          there is a need for further research to develop more advanced methods
          that can account for these interactions and provide a more
          comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms.

          Context: Transcriptomic analyses of genetic variants and human
          diseases have been instrumental in understanding disease etiology at
          the transcriptome level.

          Content: Functional genomics approaches such as transcription-wide
          association studies (TWAS) have been highly successful in identifying
          disease risk factors, predicting drug response, and repurposing drugs
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. However,
          these approaches only focus on individual genes and do not capture
          more complex interactions at the network level.

          Conclusion: Our manuscript addresses this gap by using gene
          co-expression analysis to identify disease mechanisms that involve
          multiple genes. By integrating functional genomics data with gene
          expression data across several tissues, we can provide a mechanistic
          interpretation for GWAS findings and identify therapeutic targets that
          are more likely to be effective in treating complex diseases.

          **Context:** Genetic studies have long been an important tool in
          understanding disease etiology and identifying potential therapeutic
          targets. However, these approaches often rely on testing for
          associations between genetic variants and human diseases, which can be
          challenging to interpret at the transcriptome level.


          **Content:** Functional genomics, such as gene co-expression analysis,
          has emerged as a powerful approach to identifying biological processes
          that underlie disease risk and drug response. TWAS (Transcription-wide
          Association Study) is one such method that integrates eQTLs
          (Expression Quantitative Trait Loci) data to provide a mechanistic
          interpretation for GWAS findings. While TWAS has been highly
          successful in identifying disease risk genes, it does not capture more
          complex interactions at the network level.


          **Conclusion:** Our manuscript proposes a novel approach that combines
          gene expression patterns with network analysis to identify disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms. By clustering complex traits based on
          their genetic and functional associations, we hope to provide new
          insights into disease pathways and potential therapeutic targets. Our
          study highlights an important gap in the literature by integrating
          gene expression data with network analysis to capture more complex
          interactions at the network level.

          TWAS is a scientific approach that focuses on identifying
          perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms that mediate the
          association between genetic variants and human diseases. This method
          has been highly successful in understanding disease etiology at the
          transcriptome level, predicting disease risk, and repurposing drugs
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. However, the
          focus on individual genes does not capture more complex interactions
          at the network level. To address this gap, TWAS integrates expression
          quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic
          interpretation for GWAS findings. This method has shown promise in
          identifying biological processes across several tissues

          In summary, TWAS is a valuable tool for identifying perturbations in
          gene regulatory mechanisms that mediate the association between
          genetic variants and human diseases. While this method has been highly
          successful in understanding disease etiology, it does not capture more

          TWAS provides a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings and has
          shown promise in identifying biological processes across several
          tissues. Further research is needed to fully understand the potential
          of TWAS and its limitations.

          ## Context


          TWAS is a powerful method used in genetic studies to investigate the
          relationship between genetic variants and human diseases. It relies on
          testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate
          this association.


          ## Content


          The literature has shown that TWAS approaches have been highly
          successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome
          level, predicting disease risk (polygenic scores), and repurposing
          drugs [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w;
          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. However, one limitation of TWAS is
          that it works at the individual gene level, which does not capture
          more complex interactions at the network level.


          ## Conclusion


          In this manuscript, we propose a novel approach to overcome this
          limitation by integrating gene co-expression data and clustering of
          complex traits. Our method provides a mechanistic interpretation for
          GWAS findings and highlights therapeutic targets for drug repurposing.
          By combining functional genomics with gene expression patterns, our
          study sheds light on the etiology of diseases and opens up new avenues
          for drug discovery.

          risk prediction. Addressing this gap will require the development of
          new methods that can integrate network-level data into TWAS analyses.

          TWAS is a powerful tool that relies on testing whether perturbations
          in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic
          variants and human diseases. This approach has been highly successful
          in understanding disease etiology and predicting disease risk at the
          transcriptome level, as well as identifying potential drug targets for
          repurposing. However, TWAS only considers individual genes, which does
          not capture more complex interactions at the network level. To
          overcome this limitation, our manuscript proposes a novel approach
          that combines functional genomics with gene co-expression analysis to
          identify disease-associated biological processes and therapeutic
          targets. By clustering complex traits based on gene expression
          patterns, we can gain a mechanistic understanding of disease etiology
          and drug mechanisms at the network level. Our study will provide
          valuable insights into the molecular basis of disease and inform the
          development of personalized treatments.

          ## Context

          TWAS is a scientific approach that aims to understand the association
          between genetic variants and human diseases by testing whether
          perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate this relationship.


          ## Content

          The literature suggests that TWAS has been highly successful in
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level, as well as in
          disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) and drug repurposing tasks.
          One of the advantages of TWAS is the availability of gene expression
          data across several tissues, which makes it an effective approach to
          identify biological processes. However, TWAS works at the individual
          gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the
          network level.


          ## Conclusion

          In summary, TWAS is a valuable tool for understanding disease etiology
          and predicting disease risk, but its limitations include the inability
          to capture more complex interactions at the network level. Further
          research is needed to develop methods that can integrate gene
          expression data across tissues and provide a comprehensive view of
          disease mechanisms.

          **Context:** The study of genetic associations and their role in human
          diseases has been a topic of interest for many years.


          **Content:** Functional genomics techniques such as transcriptome-wide
          association studies (TWAS) have been highly successful in
          understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level and
          predicting disease risk through polygenic scores. Additionally, TWAS
          has also been used to identify potential therapeutic targets for drug
          repurposing. However, the approach of TWAS only works at the
          individual gene level, which does not capture more complex
          interactions at the network level.


          **Conclusion:** The current manuscript proposes a novel approach that
          combines TWAS with gene co-expression analysis to identify biological
          processes involved in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This
          approach will provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings
          by capturing more complex interactions at the network level, which can
          lead to better understanding of disease mechanisms and the development
          of new therapeutic targets.

          The Transcriptomics Workbench for Associating Sequences (TWAS) is a
          powerful tool in the field of genetics and disease research. It relies
          on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate
          the association between genetic variants and human diseases. This
          approach has been highly successful in understanding disease etiology
          at the transcriptome level, as well as in disease-risk prediction
          (polygenic scores) and drug repurposing tasks. The availability of

          Context: Gene expression data has become increasingly available across
          various tissues, providing a valuable resource for understanding
          biological processes at the transcriptome level.


          Content: However, traditional approaches such as transcription-wide
          association studies (TWAS) only provide a mechanistic interpretation
          of genetic variants and their association with diseases at the
          individual gene level. This approach does not capture more complex
          interactions at the network level. TWAS relies on testing whether
          perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association
          between genetic variants and human diseases, which has been highly
          successful in disease etiology, risk prediction, drug repurposing, and
          other tasks.


          Conclusion: While TWAS is a valuable tool for understanding biological
          processes at the transcriptome level, it does not capture more complex
          interactions at the network level. Therefore, there is a need to
          develop new approaches that can provide a comprehensive understanding
          of disease etiology and risk prediction at the network level.

          Context: Gene expression data has become increasingly available across
          various tissues, providing a wealth of information for studying
          complex biological processes.


          Content: Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) have emerged as
          an effective approach to identify gene expression patterns associated
          with genetic variants and human diseases. However, these studies focus
          on individual genes and do not capture the more complex interactions
          at the network level. TWAS relies on testing whether perturbations in
          gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic
          variants and diseases, which has been successful in disease etiology
          studies, risk prediction (polygenic scores), and drug repurposing
          tasks.


          Conclusion: While TWAS has provided valuable insights into disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms at the transcriptome level, a more
          comprehensive approach that captures network-level interactions is
          needed to fully understand the complexities of genetic associations
          with diseases. Our manuscript aims to address this gap by integrating
          gene co-expression analysis with functional genomics data to identify
          novel therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities for
          various complex traits.

          **Context:** Gene expression data has been widely collected across
          various tissues, providing a wealth of information for studying
          biological processes at the transcriptome level.


          **Content:** Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) have
          emerged as an effective approach to identify gene expression patterns
          associated with human diseases by integrating eQTLs data. TWAS works
          by testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate

          The abundance of gene expression data across various tissues has
          facilitated the identification of biological processes through
          transcription-wide association studies (TWAS). TWAS integrates eQTLs
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings, but it
          operates at the individual gene level, which does not capture more
          intricate interactions at the network level. TWAS tests whether
          perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association

          The availability of gene expression data across multiple tissues
          offers an effective approach to identify biological processes.
          Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) can be used to integrate
          expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data and provide a
          mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings at the individual gene
          level. However, TWAS does not capture more complex interactions at the
          network level. In order to understand disease etiology at the
          transcriptome level, approaches such as testing whether perturbations
          in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic
          variants and human diseases have been highly successful
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. These
          methods have also been highly successful in disease-risk prediction
          (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w], drug repurposing
          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618], and have been used in various other
          applications.

          Context: Gene expression data are increasingly available across
          various tissues, providing valuable insights into the molecular
          mechanisms underlying human diseases. However, these datasets often
          contain complex interactions between genes that cannot be fully
          captured by analyzing individual gene expression patterns.


          Content: Functional genomics approaches, such as transcription-wide
          association studies (TWAS), have been successful in identifying
          genetic associations with disease etiology and drug mechanisms at the
          transcriptome level. TWAS integrates eQTLs data to provide a
          mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings, allowing researchers to
          test whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the
          association between genetic variants and human diseases.


          Conclusion: While TWAS has been successful in understanding disease
          etiology at the transcriptome level and predicting disease risk
          through polygenic scores, it does not capture more complex
          interactions at the network level. Our manuscript aims to address this
          gap by projecting genetic associations through gene expression
          patterns, highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms at a
          systems level. By leveraging clustering of complex traits, we aim to
          uncover novel therapeutic targets for diseases that are not well
          understood or have limited treatment options.

          However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not

          Context: The availability of gene expression data across various
          tissues provides a valuable resource for identifying biological
          processes related to human diseases. However, traditional approaches
          like transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) only focus on
          individual genes and do not capture the complexity of interactions at
          the network level.


          Content: TWAS uses eQTLs data to provide a mechanistic interpretation
          for GWAS findings, but it works at the individual gene level. This
          approach has been highly successful in understanding disease etiology
          at the transcriptome level and in disease-risk prediction (polygenic
          scores) and drug repurposing tasks.


          Conclusion: Our manuscript aims to address this gap by projecting
          genetic associations through gene expression patterns, which
          highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms at a network level. By
          combining eQTLs data with clustering of complex traits, we can
          identify disease-associated genes and pathways that may not have been
          captured by traditional approaches. This will provide new insights
          into the underlying mechanisms of human diseases and lead to the
          discovery of novel therapeutic targets.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section.


          Input paragraph: Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach
          that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The
          flexibility of our method allows integrating different data modalities
          into the same representation for a joint analysis. We show that this
          module perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes
          influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic
          properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations
          affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps
          gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses
          into a common latent representation. For this, we integrate thousands
          of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan
          [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs
          (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a
          low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens
          of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
          [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a
          latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach
          [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that
          extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
          preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When
          mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells,
          corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological
          assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose
          tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell
          types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large
          and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
          associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states.
          We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan
          (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records
          and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort).
          Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in
          HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules
          than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be
          involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance.
          Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also
          better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing
          tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the
          mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits
          via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction
          suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine
          drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring
          the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
          with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
          with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In
          summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different
          complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act
          together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This
          approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic
          associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and
          potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single
          gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a
          conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the
          potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations
          to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic
          modalities.

          [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that
          extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
          preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When
          mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells,
          corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological
          assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose
          tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell
          types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large
          and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
          associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states.
          We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan
          (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records
          and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort).
          Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in
          HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules
          than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be
          involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance.
          Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also
          better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing
          tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the
          mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits
          via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction
          suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine
          drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring
          the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
          with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
          with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In
          summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different
          complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act
          together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This
          approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic
          associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and
          potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single
          gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a
          conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the
          potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations
          to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic
          modalities.

          In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative approach that
          integrates gene modules into genetic studies. By combining different
          data modalities into a single representation, our method enables joint
          analysis of complex traits and allows for the discovery of shared and
          distinct transcriptomic properties among them. We demonstrate how
          PhenoPLIER can infer how groups of functionally-related genes
          influence complex traits, detect drug-induced transcriptional
          responses, and predict their effects on gene activity to exert
          therapeutic outcomes. 


          To achieve this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations
          (from TWAS in PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and
          transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000
          [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space
          learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of
          RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003;
          @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a latent representation defined by
          matrix factorization approaches that extract gene modules with
          specific sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align
          with prior knowledge (pathways). Our results show that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, such as hypothyroidism with T cells or corneal endothelial
          cells with keratometry measurements. Furthermore, we observe that
          significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery
          cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics
          (eMERGE) network phase III (our replication cohort). 


          Our approach also demonstrates improved drug-disease prediction by
          capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with
          the mechanism of action of drugs. For instance, we observe that niacin
          is associated with cardiovascular traits via an immune mechanism in
          liver cells. Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based
          method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by
          capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with
          the mechanism of action of drugs. 


          Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait
          clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch
          involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric
          disorders. In summary, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that
          act together to carry out different functions in specific cell types,
          which improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic
          associations and prioritizes alternative and potentially more
          promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations
          are not detected. Our approach represents a conceptual shift in the
          interpretation of genetic studies and has the potential to extract
          mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance the
          understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.

          (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a
          low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens
          of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
          [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a
          latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach
          [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that
          extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
          preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When
          mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells,
          corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological
          assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose
          tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell
          types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large
          and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
          associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states.
          We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan
          (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records
          and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort).
          Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in
          HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules
          than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be
          involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance.
          Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also
          better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing
          tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the
          mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits
          via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction
          suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine
          drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring
          the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
          with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
          with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In
          summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different
          complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act
          together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This
          approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic
          associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and
          potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single
          gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a
          conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the
          potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations
          to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic
          modalities.

          Context: Genetic studies have traditionally focused on single genes,
          but recent advances in technology and methodology have enabled a more
          holistic approach to understanding gene function and disease
          mechanisms. 

          Content: PhenoPLIER is an omnigenic method that integrates different
          data modalities into a common latent representation for joint
          analysis. This module perspective allows for the inference of how
          groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits,
          detection of shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among
          traits, and prediction of how pharmacological perturbations affect
          genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait
          associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a
          low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens
          of thousands of RNA-seq samples. The method uses a latent
          representation defined by a matrix factorization approach that
          extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
          preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). 

          Conclusion: PhenoPLIER's module perspective provides a more robust and
          interpretable approach to genetic studies. By analyzing groups of
          genes that act together in specific cell types, PhenoPLIER improves
          the detection and interpretation of genetic associations. The method
          can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate
          targets even when known single gene associations are not detected.
          Furthermore, PhenoPLIER's drug-disease prediction suggests that
          modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease
          relationships than individual genes. Overall, PhenoPLIER represents a
          conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies and has the
          potential to enhance our understanding of complex diseases and their
          therapeutic modalities.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section.


          Input paragraph: Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach

          In this manuscript, we propose PhenoPLIER, an innovative method that
          integrates gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional
          responses into a common latent representation to provide a gene module
          perspective for genetic studies. Our approach is omnigenic and can
          integrate different data modalities into the same representation for
          joint analysis. We demonstrate that PhenoPLIER can infer how groups of
          functionally related genes influence complex traits, detect shared and
          distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict how
          pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert their

          To achieve this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations

          expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells,
          corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological
          assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose
          tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell
          types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large
          and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
          associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states.
          We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan
          (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records
          and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort).
          Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in
          HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules
          than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be
          involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance.
          Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also
          better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing
          tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the
          mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits
          via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction
          suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine
          drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring
          the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
          with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
          with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In
          summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different
          complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act
          together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This
          approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic
          associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and
          potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single
          gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a
          conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the
          potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations
          to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic
          modalities.

          We propose an omnigenic approach called PhenoPLIER that integrates
          gene expression data with other types of molecular and clinical data
          to study genetic associations and drug mechanisms. Our method allows
          for a joint analysis of multiple data modalities, including genomic,
          transcriptomic, epigenomic, and clinical data, into a common latent
          space. We show that this module perspective can identify functional
          relationships between genes and complex traits, detect shared and
          distinct molecular properties among traits, and predict how
          pharmacological perturbations affect gene activity to exert their
          effects.


          To achieve these goals, we integrate thousands of gene-trait
          associations from TWAS in PhenomeXcan with transcriptional profiles of
          drugs from LINCS L1000 into a low-dimensional space learned from
          public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples.
          We use a latent representation defined by matrix factorization that
          extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
          preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When
          mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we
          observe significant correlations between diseases and gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types.


          We also show that PhenoPLIER can identify modules associated with cell
          types under specific stimuli or disease states. Our approach has the
          potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations
          to enhance our understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic
          modalities. For example, we observe that significant module-trait
          associations in our discovery cohort replicated in the Electronic
          Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III, suggesting
          that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease
          relationships than individual genes. Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR
          screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells and observe more
          robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes,
          even when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did
          not reach genome-wide significance.


          In conclusion, our omnigenic approach can prioritize alternative and
          potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single
          gene associations are not detected, providing a conceptual shift in
          the interpretation of genetic studies. PhenoPLIER has the potential to
          improve robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations,
          and its ability to integrate multiple data modalities makes it a
          valuable tool for drug discovery and precision medicine.

          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These

          In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative approach that
          integrates gene modules into genetic studies. Our method allows for
          the analysis of multiple data modalities within a single
          representation. We demonstrate that this module perspective can reveal
          how groups of functionally related genes influence complex traits,
          identify shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits,
          and predict how pharmacological perturbations affect gene activity to
          exert their effects. 


          To achieve this, we map gene-trait associations and drug-induced
          transcriptional responses into a common latent representation. We
          integrate thousands of gene-trait associations from TWAS in
          PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083] and transcriptional profiles
          of drugs from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049] into a
          low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens
          of thousands of RNA-seq samples from recount2
          [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]. We use a
          latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach
          [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that
          extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
          preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). 


          We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, such as hypothyroidism with
          T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements,
          hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with
          adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain
          cell types. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our module-based approach
          can identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli
          or disease states, and replicate significant module-trait associations
          in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase
          III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225].


          We also performed a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2
          cells and observed more robust trait associations with modules than
          with individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in
          lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance. Our
          module-based method also better predicted FDA-approved drug-disease
          links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms
          linked with the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with
          cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved
          drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better
          means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes.


          Finally, we explored the phenotype-module space and revealed stable
          trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex
          branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and
          neuropsychiatric disorders. Our approach represents a conceptual shift
          in the interpretation of genetic studies and has the potential to
          extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance
          our understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic
          modalities.

          Input paragraph: Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach
          that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The
          flexibility of our method allows integrating different data modalities
          into the same representation for a joint analysis. We show that this
          module perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes
          influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic
          properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations
          affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps
          gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses
          into a common latent representation. For this, we integrate thousands
          of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan
          [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs
          (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a
          low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens
          of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
          [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a

          tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell
          types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large
          and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
          associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states.
          We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan
          (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records
          and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72;

          approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic
          associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and

          We present PhenoPLIER, an approach that integrates gene expression
          data with other omnigenomic datasets to identify functional modules
          associated with genetic studies. Our method allows for a joint
          analysis of different data modalities and can infer how groups of
          functionally-related genes influence complex traits. We show that this
          module perspective can detect shared and distinct transcriptomic
          properties among traits, predict how pharmacological perturbations
          affect genes' activity to exert their effects, and map gene-trait
          associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common
          latent representation.


          In our work, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations (from
          PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional
          profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049])
          into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data
          on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
          [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a
          latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach
          [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that
          extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
          preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When
          mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells,
          corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological
          assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose
          tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell
          types. Furthermore, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large
          and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
          associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states.


          Our approach has several advantages over traditional single-gene
          studies. Firstly, it improves robustness in detecting and interpreting
          genetic associations by incorporating groups of genes that act
          together to carry out different functions in specific cell types.
          Secondly, it can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising
          candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not
          detected. Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable
          trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex

          neuropsychiatric disorders. Our work has the potential to extract

          traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations affect genes'
          activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait
          associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common
          latent representation by integrating thousands of gene-trait
          associations (from TWAS in PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083])
          and transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000
          [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space
          learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of
          RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003;
          @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). Our method uses a latent representation
          defined by a matrix factorization approach
          [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that
          extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
          preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). We
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, such as hypothyroidism with T cells,
          corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological
          assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose
          tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell
          types. Our method can also identify modules associated with cell types
          under specific stimuli or disease states, which can improve robustness
          in detecting and interpreting genetic associations. Additionally, we
          perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells and
          observe more robust trait associations with modules than with
          individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in lipid
          metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance. This suggests that
          modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease
          relationships than individual genes. Finally, we explore the
          phenotype-module space and observe stable trait clusters associated
          with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
          with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In
          summary, PhenoPLIER offers a new approach to gene studies that
          considers groups of genes that act together in specific cell types.
          This method improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic
          associations and has the potential to prioritize alternative and
          potentially more promising candidate targets even when known
          single-gene associations are not detected.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section.


          Input paragraph: Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach
          that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The
          flexibility of our method allows integrating different data modalities
          into the same representation for a joint analysis. We show that this
          module perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes
          influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic
          properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations
          affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps
          gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses
          into a common latent representation. For this, we integrate thousands
          of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan
          [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs
          (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a
          low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens
          of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
          [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a
          latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach
          [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that
          extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
          preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When
          mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells,
          corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological
          assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose
          tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell
          types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large
          and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
          associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states.
          We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan
          (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records
          and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort).
          Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in
          HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules
          than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be
          involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance.
          Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also
          better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing
          tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the
          mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits
          via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction
          suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine
          drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring
          the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
          with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
          with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In
          summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different
          complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act
          together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This
          approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic
          associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and
          potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single
          gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a
          conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the
          potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations
          to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic
          modalities.

          Input paragraph: Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach
          that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The
          flexibility of our method allows integrating different data modalities
          into the same representation for a joint analysis. We show that this
          module perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes
          influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic
          properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations
          affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps
          gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses
          into a common latent representation. For this, we integrate thousands
          of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan
          [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs
          (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a
          low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens
          of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
          [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a
          latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach
          [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that
          extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
          preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When
          mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells,
          corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological
          assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose
          tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell
          types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large
          and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
          associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states.
          We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan
          (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records
          and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort).
          Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in
          HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules
          than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be
          involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance.
          Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also
          better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing
          tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the
          mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits
          via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction
          suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine
          drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring
          the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
          with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
          with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In
          summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different
          complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act
          together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This
          approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic
          associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and
          potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single
          gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a
          conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the
          potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations
          to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic
          modalities.

          We introduce PhenoPLIER, an innovative method that combines a gene
          module perspective with omnigenic analysis for genetic studies. Our
          approach integrates multiple data modalities into a common latent
          representation to infer how groups of functionally-related genes
          influence complex traits and predict how pharmacological perturbations
          affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps
          gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses
          into a low-dimensional space using thousands of gene-trait
          associations from TWAS from PhenomeXcan, transcriptional profiles of
          drugs from LINCS L1000, and public gene expression data on tens of
          thousands of RNA-seq samples from recount2. We use a latent
          representation defined by matrix factorization to extract gene modules
          with sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with
          prior knowledge (pathways). By mapping disease-associated genes to
          this reduced expression space, we observe significant associations
          between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          Furthermore, our method can identify modules associated with specific
          stimuli or disease states by leveraging models derived from large and
          heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
          PhenoPLIER through replicating its findings in the Electronic Medical
          Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III, where we observe that
          significant module-trait associations in our discovery cohort
          replicated in our replication cohort. Additionally, we perform a
          CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells and find more
          robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes. Our
          approach prioritizes alternative and potentially more promising
          candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not
          detected, providing a conceptual shift in the interpretation of
          genetic studies. PhenoPLIER has the potential to enhance our
          understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities by
          extracting mechanistic insight from statistical associations.

          Input paragraph: Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach
          that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The
          flexibility of our method allows integrating different data modalities
          into the same representation for a joint analysis. We show that this
          module perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes
          influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic
          properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations
          affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps
          gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses
          into a common latent representation. For this, we integrate thousands
          of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan
          [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs
          (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a
          low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens
          of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
          [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a
          latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach
          [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that
          extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
          preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When
          mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells,
          corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological
          assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose
          tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell
          types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large
          and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
          associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states.
          We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan
          (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records
          and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort).
          Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in
          HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules
          than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be
          involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance.
          Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also
          better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing
          tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the
          mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits
          via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction
          suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine
          drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring
          the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
          with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
          with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In
          summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different
          complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act
          together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This
          approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic
          associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and
          potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single
          gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a
          conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the
          potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations
          to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic
          modalities.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following

          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These

              Gene networks work in context-specific ways to carry out different
              functions, and variations in these genes can alter their
              functional roles and affect disease-relevant biological processes.
              To understand how genes influence complex traits, we must
              mechanistically understand expression regulation across different
              cell types. Previous studies have described various regulatory DNA
              elements, including genetic effects on gene expression across
              different tissues. Integrating functional genomics data and GWAS
              data has improved the identification of these transcriptional
              mechanisms, which are commonly dysregulated in tissue- and cell
              lineage-specific pathology.

              Context: Genes work together in context-specific networks to carry
              out different functions. Variations in these genes can change
              their functional role and, at a higher level, affect
              disease-relevant biological processes.


              Content: To understand how genes influence complex traits, it is
              necessary to mechanistically understand expression regulation
              across different cell types. Previous studies have described
              different regulatory DNA elements including genetic effects on
              gene expression across different tissues. Integrating functional
              genomics data and GWAS data has improved the identification of

              result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology.


              Conclusion: This manuscript aims to address a knowledge gap by
              projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
              and identifying disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By analyzing
              gene co-expression networks across different cell types, we hope
              to uncover new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing
              opportunities. Our study will contribute to the clustering of
              complex traits by integrating functional genomics data and GWAS
              data, providing a more comprehensive understanding of how genes
              influence disease-relevant biological processes.

              Context: Genes work together in context-specific networks to carry

              Content: Variations in these genes can change their functional
              role and affect disease-relevant biological processes. Determining
              how genes influence complex traits requires understanding
              expression regulation across different cell types, which should
              lead to improved treatments. Previous studies have described
              regulatory DNA elements including genetic effects on gene
              expression across different tissues. Integrating functional
              genomics data and GWAS data has improved the identification of
              transcriptional mechanisms that, when dysregulated, commonly
              result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology.


              Conclusion: Despite previous studies describing regulatory DNA
              elements, there is still a knowledge gap regarding how these
              mechanisms influence complex traits and contribute to disease
              development. This manuscript aims to address this gap by
              investigating the role of gene expression regulation in complex
              traits and its impact on disease outcomes. By integrating
              functional genomics data and GWAS data, we hope to identify novel
              transcriptional mechanisms that can be targeted for improved
              treatments.

              Context: Genes work together in context-specific networks to carry
              out different functions.


              Content: Variations in these genes can change their functional
              role and, at a higher level, affect disease-relevant biological
              processes. Determining how genes influence complex traits requires
              mechanistically understanding expression regulation across
              different cell types. Previous studies have described different
              regulatory DNA elements including genetic effects on gene
              expression across different tissues. Integrating functional
              genomics data and GWAS data has improved the identification of
              these transcriptional mechanisms that, when dysregulated, commonly
              result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology.


              Conclusion: Our manuscript addresses the knowledge gap by
              providing a comprehensive analysis of gene expression regulation
              across different cell types and its impact on complex traits. By
              integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data, we have
              identified novel transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to
              tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology. Our findings provide
              valuable insights into disease-relevant biological processes and
              pave the way for improved treatments.

              **Context:** Genes work together in networks to carry out
              different functions, and variations in these genes can affect
              disease-relevant biological processes.


              **Content:** Understanding how genes influence complex traits
              requires mechanistically understanding expression regulation
              across different cell types. Previous studies have described
              different regulatory DNA elements, including genetic effects on
              gene expression across different tissues. Integrating functional
              genomics data and GWAS data has improved the identification of
              these transcriptional mechanisms that, when dysregulated, commonly
              result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology.


              **Conclusion:** This manuscript aims to project genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns, highlighting
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By integrating functional
              genomics data and GWAS data, we will identify these
              transcriptional mechanisms that, when dysregulated, commonly
              result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology. This
              knowledge gap will lead to improved treatments for complex
              diseases.

              Context: Genes work together in context-specific networks to carry
              out different functions, and variations in these genes can change
              their functional role and affect disease-relevant biological
              processes.

              Content: Determining how genes influence complex traits requires
              understanding expression regulation across different cell types.
              Previous studies have described different regulatory DNA elements,
              including genetic effects on gene expression across different
              tissues. Integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data has
              improved the identification of these transcriptional mechanisms
              that, when dysregulated, commonly result in tissue- and cell
              lineage-specific pathology.

              Conclusion: This manuscript addresses a knowledge gap by exploring
              the role of genes in complex traits, specifically focusing on
              expression regulation across different cell types. By integrating
              functional genomics data and GWAS data, we aim to identify
              transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to tissue- and cell
              lineage-specific pathology. Our findings have the potential to
              improve treatments for these diseases.

              Context: Genes work together in context-specific networks to carry
              out different functions.


              Content: Variations in these genes can change their functional
              role and, at a higher level, affect disease-relevant biological
              processes. Determining how genes influence complex traits requires
              mechanistically understanding expression regulation across
              different cell types. Previous studies have described different
              regulatory DNA elements including genetic effects on gene

              Conclusion: Our manuscript addresses the knowledge gap by
              projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
              to highlight disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By doing so, we
              hope to enhance our understanding of complex traits and improve

              The availability of extensive gene expression data across multiple

              effective method for achieving this is through transcription-wide
              association studies (TWAS), which integrate expression
              quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data to provide a mechanistic
              interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS aims to test whether

              **Context:** Gene expression data is widely available in various
              tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;

              **Content:** To identify biological processes from this data, a
              powerful tool is transcription-wide association study (TWAS),
              which combines expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to
              provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS tests

              @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This
              approach has been highly successful in understanding disease
              etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;

              gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at
              the network level.


              **Conclusion:** Our manuscript addresses this gap by projecting
              genetic associations through gene expression patterns to identify
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By analyzing gene
              co-expression networks, we can gain insights into the underlying
              biological processes that mediate these associations, which may
              inform therapeutic targets and drug repurposing strategies.

              However, TWAS operates at the individual gene level, which fails
              to capture more intricate interactions at the network level.
              Therefore, there is a knowledge gap that needs to be addressed by
              exploring the use of TWAS in combination with other approaches
              that can account for network effects. This approach could
              potentially enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms and

              The extensive availability of gene expression data across multiple
              tissues provides a valuable opportunity to identify biological
              processes using transcription-wide association studies (TWAS).
              TWAS integrates quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data to provide a
              mechanistic interpretation for genome-wide association study
              (GWAS) findings. By testing whether perturbations in gene
              regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic
              variants and human diseases, TWAS has been highly successful in
              understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level

              works at the individual gene level and does not capture more

              these approaches have been highly successful in understanding
              disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] and disease-risk
              prediction (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w].
              However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not
              capture more complex interactions at the network level. This gap
              in understanding can be addressed by combining TWAS with other
              methods such as functional genomics and gene co-expression
              analysis to identify disease-related pathways and therapeutic
              targets [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
              @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9].


              In summary, while TWAS is a valuable tool for identifying disease
              etiology at the transcriptome level, it does not capture more
              complex interactions at the network level. By combining TWAS with
              functional genomics and gene co-expression analysis, we can
              identify disease-related pathways and therapeutic targets that may
              be missed by individual gene-level analyses. This approach has the
              potential to enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms and
              drug repurposing, ultimately leading to more effective treatments
              for complex traits.

              Gene expression data is widely available across various tissues
              [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;
              @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. To
              effectively identify these biological processes, a powerful tool
              is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which
              integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to

              gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at
              the network level.


              In summary, TWAS is a powerful tool for identifying biological
              processes from gene expression data. While it has been successful
              in disease etiology, risk prediction, and drug repurposing, its
              limitations lie in its focus on individual genes, which does not
              capture complex interactions at the network level. Future research
              should explore ways to integrate TWAS with other approaches to
              better understand these interactions and their role in disease
              development and treatment.

              Gene expression data is widely available across various tissues,
              making it an effective approach to identify biological processes.
              Transcription-wide association study (TWAS) integrates eQTLs data
              and provides a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings by
              testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms
              mediate the association between genetic variants and human
              diseases. TWAS has been highly successful not only in

              **Context:** Gene expression data is now widely available across
              various tissues, providing an opportunity to identify biological
              processes that contribute to human diseases.


              **Content:** An effective approach for this task is
              transcription-wide association studies (TWAS), which integrates
              eQTLs data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS
              findings. TWAS tests whether perturbations in gene regulatory
              mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and
              human diseases, and has been successful in understanding disease
              etiology at the transcriptome level, as well as in disease-risk
              prediction and drug repurposing tasks.


              **Conclusion:** However, TWAS works at the individual gene level,
              which does not capture more complex interactions at the network
              level. Therefore, there is a need to develop methods that can
              integrate gene expression data with other omics data to identify
              disease-associated genetic variants and therapeutic targets. Our
              manuscript aims to address this knowledge gap by developing a
              novel method that combines gene co-expression analysis with
              clustering of complex traits to identify disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms.

              Context: Gene expression data is available across various tissues,
              providing a rich source of information for studying biological
              processes.


              Content: The transcription-wide association study (TWAS) is an
              effective approach to identify these processes by integrating
              expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data. TWAS tests
              whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the
              association between genetic variants and human diseases, and has

              other related tasks.


              Conclusion: While TWAS works at the individual gene level, it does
              not capture more complex interactions at the network level.
              Therefore, there is a need to develop methods that can account for
              these interactions and provide a comprehensive understanding of
              biological processes. This manuscript aims to address this gap in
              knowledge by proposing a novel approach that integrates both
              gene-level and network-level data to identify complex interactions
              involved in disease etiology.

              ## Context


              The availability of gene expression data across multiple tissues
              has provided a wealth of information for understanding biological
              processes and identifying disease risk factors.


              ## Content


              To effectively analyze this data, researchers have developed
              transcription-wide association studies (TWAS), which integrate
              expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a
              mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS tests whether
              perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the
              association between genetic variants and human diseases. These
              approaches have been highly successful in understanding disease
              etiology at the transcriptome level, predicting disease risk, and
              identifying drug repurposing opportunities.


              ## Conclusion


              While TWAS has provided valuable insights into complex biological
              processes, it works at the individual gene level, which does not
              capture more complex interactions at the network level. Therefore,
              there is a need for further research to develop more advanced
              methods that can account for these interactions and provide a more
              comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms.

              Context: Transcriptomic analyses of genetic variants and human
              diseases have been instrumental in understanding disease etiology
              at the transcriptome level.

              Content: Functional genomics approaches such as transcription-wide
              association studies (TWAS) have been highly successful in
              identifying disease risk factors, predicting drug response, and
              repurposing drugs [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;

              individual genes and do not capture more complex interactions at
              the network level.

              Conclusion: Our manuscript addresses this gap by using gene
              co-expression analysis to identify disease mechanisms that involve
              multiple genes. By integrating functional genomics data with gene
              expression data across several tissues, we can provide a
              mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings and identify
              therapeutic targets that are more likely to be effective in
              treating complex diseases.

              TWAS is a methodology that investigates whether perturbations in
              gene regulatory mechanisms are associated with genetic variants
              and human diseases. This approach has been highly successful in
              understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level, as well
              as in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) and drug
              repurposing tasks. The availability of gene expression data across
              multiple tissues provides an effective means to identify
              biological processes using a transcription-wide association study
              (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci
              (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS
              findings. However, TWAS operates at the individual gene level and

              **Context:** Genetic studies have long been an important tool in
              understanding disease etiology and identifying potential
              therapeutic targets. However, these approaches often rely on
              testing for associations between genetic variants and human
              diseases, which can be challenging to interpret at the
              transcriptome level.


              **Content:** Functional genomics, such as gene co-expression
              analysis, has emerged as a powerful approach to identifying
              biological processes that underlie disease risk and drug response.
              TWAS (Transcription-wide Association Study) is one such method
              that integrates eQTLs (Expression Quantitative Trait Loci) data to
              provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. While TWAS
              has been highly successful in identifying disease risk genes, it
              does not capture more complex interactions at the network level.


              **Conclusion:** Our manuscript proposes a novel approach that
              combines gene expression patterns with network analysis to
              identify disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By clustering
              complex traits based on their genetic and functional associations,
              we hope to provide new insights into disease pathways and
              potential therapeutic targets. Our study highlights an important
              gap in the literature by integrating gene expression data with
              network analysis to capture more complex interactions at the
              network level.

              TWAS is a scientific approach that focuses on identifying
              perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms that mediate the
              association between genetic variants and human diseases. This
              method has been highly successful in understanding disease
              etiology at the transcriptome level, predicting disease risk, and
              repurposing drugs [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;
              @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889;
              @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. However, the focus on individual genes does
              not capture more complex interactions at the network level. To
              address this gap, TWAS integrates expression quantitative trait
              loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS
              findings. This method has shown promise in identifying biological
              processes across several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
              @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
              @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9].


              In summary, TWAS is a valuable tool for identifying perturbations
              in gene regulatory mechanisms that mediate the association between
              genetic variants and human diseases. While this method has been
              highly successful in understanding disease etiology, it does not
              capture more complex interactions at the network level. By
              integrating eQTLs data, TWAS provides a mechanistic interpretation
              for GWAS findings and has shown promise in identifying biological
              processes across several tissues. Further research is needed to
              fully understand the potential of TWAS and its limitations.

              perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms are associated with
              genetic variants and human diseases. This approach has been highly
              successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome
              level, predicting disease risk (polygenic scores), and identifying
              drug repurposing candidates [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;

              @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. The availability of gene expression data
              across various tissues provides an opportunity to identify
              biological processes using transcription-wide association studies
              (TWAS) that integrate expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
              data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings
              [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9].
              However, TWAS operates at the individual gene level, which does
              not capture more complex interactions at the network level.

              ## Context


              TWAS is a powerful method used in genetic studies to investigate
              the relationship between genetic variants and human diseases. It
              relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory
              mechanisms mediate this association.


              ## Content


              The literature has shown that TWAS approaches have been highly
              successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome
              level, predicting disease risk (polygenic scores), and repurposing
              drugs [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
              @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889;

              However, one limitation of TWAS is that it works at the individual
              gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at
              the network level.


              ## Conclusion


              In this manuscript, we propose a novel approach to overcome this
              limitation by integrating gene co-expression data and clustering
              of complex traits. Our method provides a mechanistic
              interpretation for GWAS findings and highlights therapeutic
              targets for drug repurposing. By combining functional genomics
              with gene expression patterns, our study sheds light on the
              etiology of diseases and opens up new avenues for drug discovery.

              regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic
              variants and human diseases.

              Conclusion: While TWAS is an effective approach at the individual
              gene level, it does not capture more complex interactions at the

              be addressed in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of
              disease etiology and risk prediction. Addressing this gap will
              require the development of new methods that can integrate
              network-level data into TWAS analyses.

              TWAS is a powerful tool that relies on testing whether
              perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the
              association between genetic variants and human diseases. This
              approach has been highly successful in understanding disease
              etiology and predicting disease risk at the transcriptome level,
              as well as identifying potential drug targets for repurposing.
              However, TWAS only considers individual genes, which does not
              capture more complex interactions at the network level. To
              overcome this limitation, our manuscript proposes a novel approach
              that combines functional genomics with gene co-expression analysis
              to identify disease-associated biological processes and
              therapeutic targets. By clustering complex traits based on gene
              expression patterns, we can gain a mechanistic understanding of
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms at the network level. Our
              study will provide valuable insights into the molecular basis of
              disease and inform the development of personalized treatments.

              ## Context

              TWAS is a scientific approach that aims to understand the
              association between genetic variants and human diseases by testing
              whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate this
              relationship.


              ## Content

              The literature suggests that TWAS has been highly successful in
              disease etiology at the transcriptome level, as well as in
              disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) and drug repurposing
              tasks. One of the advantages of TWAS is the availability of gene
              expression data across several tissues, which makes it an
              effective approach to identify biological processes. However, TWAS
              works at the individual gene level, which does not capture more
              complex interactions at the network level.


              ## Conclusion

              In summary, TWAS is a valuable tool for understanding disease
              etiology and predicting disease risk, but its limitations include
              the inability to capture more complex interactions at the network
              level. Further research is needed to develop methods that can
              integrate gene expression data across tissues and provide a
              comprehensive view of disease mechanisms.

              **Context:** The study of genetic associations and their role in
              human diseases has been a topic of interest for many years.


              **Content:** Functional genomics techniques such as
              transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been highly
              successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome
              level and predicting disease risk through polygenic scores.
              Additionally, TWAS has also been used to identify potential
              therapeutic targets for drug repurposing. However, the approach of
              TWAS only works at the individual gene level, which does not
              capture more complex interactions at the network level.


              **Conclusion:** The current manuscript proposes a novel approach
              that combines TWAS with gene co-expression analysis to identify
              biological processes involved in disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms. This approach will provide a mechanistic
              interpretation for GWAS findings by capturing more complex
              interactions at the network level, which can lead to better
              understanding of disease mechanisms and the development of new
              therapeutic targets.

              The Transcriptomics Workbench for Associating Sequences (TWAS) is
              a powerful tool in the field of genetics and disease research. It
              relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory
              mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and
              human diseases. This approach has been highly successful in
              understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level, as well
              as in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) and drug
              repurposing tasks. The availability of gene expression data across
              several tissues provides an opportunity to identify biological
              processes using a transcription-wide association study (TWAS),
              which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data
              to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.
              However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not
              capture more complex interactions at the network level.

              The availability of gene expression data across various tissues
              provides a valuable resource for identifying biological processes.
              Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) can be used to
              integrate eQTLs data and provide a mechanistic interpretation for
              GWAS findings. However, TWAS operates at the individual gene
              level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the

              highly successful in understanding disease etiology at the

              these studies have not explored the potential for identifying
              therapeutic targets and drug mechanisms using gene co-expression
              patterns. In this manuscript, we propose a novel approach that
              leverages gene expression patterns to identify disease-associated
              genes and predict their interactions with other genes in the
              network. Our findings will provide insights into disease etiology
              and drug mechanisms, which can be used to develop new therapeutic
              strategies.

              Context: Gene expression data has become increasingly available
              across various tissues, providing a valuable resource for
              understanding biological processes at the transcriptome level.


              Content: However, traditional approaches such as
              transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) only provide a
              mechanistic interpretation of genetic variants and their
              association with diseases at the individual gene level. This
              approach does not capture more complex interactions at the network
              level. TWAS relies on testing whether perturbations in gene
              regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic
              variants and human diseases, which has been highly successful in
              disease etiology, risk prediction, drug repurposing, and other
              tasks.


              Conclusion: While TWAS is a valuable tool for understanding
              biological processes at the transcriptome level, it does not
              capture more complex interactions at the network level. Therefore,
              there is a need to develop new approaches that can provide a
              comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and risk
              prediction at the network level.

              Context: Gene expression data has become increasingly available
              across various tissues, providing a wealth of information for
              studying complex biological processes.


              Content: Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) have
              emerged as an effective approach to identify gene expression
              patterns associated with genetic variants and human diseases.
              However, these studies focus on individual genes and do not
              capture the more complex interactions at the network level. TWAS
              relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory
              mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and
              diseases, which has been successful in disease etiology studies,
              risk prediction (polygenic scores), and drug repurposing tasks.


              Conclusion: While TWAS has provided valuable insights into disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms at the transcriptome level, a more
              comprehensive approach that captures network-level interactions is
              needed to fully understand the complexities of genetic
              associations with diseases. Our manuscript aims to address this
              gap by integrating gene co-expression analysis with functional
              genomics data to identify novel therapeutic targets and drug
              repurposing opportunities for various complex traits.

              **Context:** Gene expression data has been widely collected across
              various tissues, providing a wealth of information for studying
              biological processes at the transcriptome level.


              **Content:** Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) have
              emerged as an effective approach to identify gene expression
              patterns associated with human diseases by integrating eQTLs data.
              TWAS works by testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory
              mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and
              diseases, providing a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS
              findings. However, TWAS only operates at the individual gene
              level, which fails to capture more complex interactions at the
              network level.


              **Conclusion:** While TWAS has been highly successful in
              understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level and in
              disease-risk prediction, drug repurposing, and other tasks, it
              does not account for more complex interactions within gene
              regulatory networks. Our manuscript aims to address this knowledge
              gap by developing a novel approach that integrates both gene
              expression and network data to identify disease-associated
              biological processes at the network level.

              In recent years, advances in functional genomics have provided
              gene expression data across various tissues

              These datasets allow researchers to identify biological processes
              associated with genetic variants, providing insight into disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms. However, existing approaches, such
              as transcription-wide association studies (TWAS), focus on
              individual genes and do not capture more complex interactions at

              The availability of gene expression data across multiple tissues
              offers an effective approach to identify biological processes.
              Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) can be used to

              Context: Gene expression data are increasingly available across
              various tissues, providing valuable insights into the molecular
              mechanisms underlying human diseases. However, these datasets
              often contain complex interactions between genes that cannot be
              fully captured by analyzing individual gene expression patterns.


              Content: Functional genomics approaches, such as
              transcription-wide association studies (TWAS), have been
              successful in identifying genetic associations with disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms at the transcriptome level. TWAS
              integrates eQTLs data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for
              GWAS findings, allowing researchers to test whether perturbations
              in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between
              genetic variants and human diseases.


              Conclusion: While TWAS has been successful in understanding
              disease etiology at the transcriptome level and predicting disease
              risk through polygenic scores, it does not capture more complex
              interactions at the network level. Our manuscript aims to address
              this gap by projecting genetic associations through gene
              expression patterns, highlighting disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms at a systems level. By leveraging clustering of complex
              traits, we aim to uncover novel therapeutic targets for diseases
              that are not well understood or have limited treatment options.

              Context: Gene expression data is available across multiple
              tissues, providing a wealth of information for studying biological
              processes.


              Content: One effective method to analyze this data is through
              transcription-wide association studies (TWAS), which integrate

              does not capture more complex interactions at the network level.


              Conclusion: While TWAS has been highly successful in understanding

              Context: The availability of gene expression data across various
              tissues provides a valuable resource for identifying biological
              processes related to human diseases. However, traditional
              approaches like transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) only
              focus on individual genes and do not capture the complexity of
              interactions at the network level.


              Content: TWAS uses eQTLs data to provide a mechanistic
              interpretation for GWAS findings, but it works at the individual
              gene level. This approach has been highly successful in
              understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level and in
              disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) and drug repurposing
              tasks.


              Conclusion: Our manuscript aims to address this gap by projecting
              genetic associations through gene expression patterns, which
              highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms at a network
              level. By combining eQTLs data with clustering of complex traits,
              we can identify disease-associated genes and pathways that may not
              have been captured by traditional approaches. This will provide
              new insights into the underlying mechanisms of human diseases and
              lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets.

              In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative approach
              that integrates gene modules into genetic studies. By combining
              different data modalities into a single representation, our method
              enables joint analysis of complex traits and allows for the
              discovery of shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among
              them. We demonstrate how PhenoPLIER can infer how groups of
              functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect
              drug-induced transcriptional responses, and predict their effects
              on gene activity to exert therapeutic outcomes. 


              To achieve this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations
              (from TWAS in PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and
              transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000
              [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space
              learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of
              RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003;
              @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a latent representation defined by
              matrix factorization approaches that extract gene modules with
              specific sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align
              with prior knowledge (pathways). Our results show that diseases
              are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, such as hypothyroidism with T cells or
              corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements.
              Furthermore, we observe that significant module-trait associations
              in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic
              Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III (our
              replication cohort). 


              Our approach also demonstrates improved drug-disease prediction by
              capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked
              with the mechanism of action of drugs. For instance, we observe
              that niacin is associated with cardiovascular traits via an immune
              mechanism in liver cells. Compared to a single-gene approach, our
              module-based method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease
              links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms
              linked with the mechanism of action of drugs. 


              Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait
              clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex
              branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and
              neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, PhenoPLIER incorporates
              groups of genes that act together to carry out different functions
              in specific cell types, which improves robustness in detecting and
              interpreting genetic associations and prioritizes alternative and
              potentially more promising candidate targets even when known
              single gene associations are not detected. Our approach represents
              a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies and
              has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical
              associations to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and
              their therapeutic modalities.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining
              the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the
              following paragraph from the Introduction section.


              Input paragraph: Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach
              that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The
              flexibility of our method allows integrating different data
              modalities into the same representation for a joint analysis. We
              show that this module perspective can infer how groups of
              functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared
              and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict
              how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert
              their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and
              drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent
              representation. For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait
              associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan
              [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of
              drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a
              low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on
              tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
              [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use
              a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach
              [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003]
              that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
              preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways).
              When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression
              space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as
              hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with
              keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood
              cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and
              neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types.
              Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and
              heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
              associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease
              states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in
              PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic
              Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III
              [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our
              replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust
              trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even
              when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not
              reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene
              approach, our module-based method also better predicts
              FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific
              pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action
              of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known
              immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests
              that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease
              relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the
              phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
              with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
              with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders.
              In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with
              different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes
              that act together to carry out different functions in specific
              cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and
              interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can
              prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate
              targets even when known single gene associations are not detected.
              The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation
              of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract mechanistic
              insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding

              Context: Genetic studies have traditionally focused on single
              genes, but recent advances in technology and methodology have
              enabled a more holistic approach to understanding gene function
              and disease mechanisms. 

              Content: PhenoPLIER is an omnigenic method that integrates
              different data modalities into a common latent representation for
              joint analysis. This module perspective allows for the inference
              of how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex
              traits, detection of shared and distinct transcriptomic properties
              among traits, and prediction of how pharmacological perturbations
              affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps
              gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses
              into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression
              data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples. The method uses a
              latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach
              that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
              preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). 

              Conclusion: PhenoPLIER's module perspective provides a more robust
              and interpretable approach to genetic studies. By analyzing groups
              of genes that act together in specific cell types, PhenoPLIER
              improves the detection and interpretation of genetic associations.
              The method can prioritize alternative and potentially more
              promising candidate targets even when known single gene
              associations are not detected. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER's
              drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better
              means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes.
              Overall, PhenoPLIER represents a conceptual shift in the
              interpretation of genetic studies and has the potential to enhance
              our understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic
              modalities.

              begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context),
              progresses through what is known from the literature (Content),
              and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap your
              manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1)
              preserve the original information as much as possible, with
              minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to
              scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the
              original text. These references are crucial for academic integrity
              and may appear in formats like "[@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]", and 4) the
              revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following
              the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.


              Input paragraph: Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach
              that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The
              flexibility of our method allows integrating different data
              modalities into the same representation for a joint analysis. We
              show that this module perspective can infer how groups of
              functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared
              and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict
              how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert
              their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and
              drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent
              representation. For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait
              associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan
              [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of
              drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a
              low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on
              tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
              [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use
              a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach
              [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003]
              that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
              preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways).
              When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression
              space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as
              hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with
              keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood
              cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and
              neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types.
              Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and
              heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
              associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease
              states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in
              PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic
              Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III
              [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our
              replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust
              trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even
              when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not
              reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene
              approach, our module-based method also better predicts
              FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific
              pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action
              of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known
              immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests
              that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease
              relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the
              phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
              with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
              with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders.
              In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with
              different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes
              that act together to carry out different functions in specific
              cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and
              interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can
              prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate
              targets even when known single gene associations are not detected.
              The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation
              of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract mechanistic
              insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding
              of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.

              In this manuscript, we propose PhenoPLIER, an innovative method
              that integrates gene-trait associations and drug-induced
              transcriptional responses into a common latent representation to
              provide a gene module perspective for genetic studies. Our
              approach is omnigenic and can integrate different data modalities
              into the same representation for joint analysis. We demonstrate
              that PhenoPLIER can infer how groups of functionally related genes

              Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation in HepG2 cells and observe more robust trait

              We propose an omnigenic approach called PhenoPLIER that integrates
              gene expression data with other types of molecular and clinical
              data to study genetic associations and drug mechanisms. Our method
              allows for a joint analysis of multiple data modalities, including
              genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, and clinical data, into a
              common latent space. We show that this module perspective can
              identify functional relationships between genes and complex
              traits, detect shared and distinct molecular properties among
              traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations affect gene
              activity to exert their effects.


              To achieve these goals, we integrate thousands of gene-trait
              associations from TWAS in PhenomeXcan with transcriptional
              profiles of drugs from LINCS L1000 into a low-dimensional space
              learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of
              RNA-seq samples. We use a latent representation defined by matrix
              factorization that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity
              constraints and preferences for those that align with prior
              knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait associations to this
              reduced expression space, we observe significant correlations
              between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types.


              We also show that PhenoPLIER can identify modules associated with
              cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. Our approach
              has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical
              associations to enhance our understanding of complex diseases and
              their therapeutic modalities. For example, we observe that
              significant module-trait associations in our discovery cohort
              replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE)
              network phase III, suggesting that modules may provide a better
              means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes.
              Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation in HepG2 cells and observe more robust trait
              associations with modules than with individual genes, even when
              single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not
              reach genome-wide significance.


              In conclusion, our omnigenic approach can prioritize alternative
              and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known
              single gene associations are not detected, providing a conceptual
              shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. PhenoPLIER has the
              potential to improve robustness in detecting and interpreting
              genetic associations, and its ability to integrate multiple data
              modalities makes it a valuable tool for drug discovery and
              precision medicine.

              the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance
              clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The
              revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a
              Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure
              begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context),
              progresses through what is known from the literature (Content),
              and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap your

              original text. These references are crucial for academic integrity
              and may appear in formats like "[@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]", and 4) the
              revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following
              the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.


              Input paragraph: Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach
              that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The
              flexibility of our method allows integrating different data
              modalities into the same representation for a joint analysis. We
              show that this module perspective can infer how groups of
              functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared
              and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict
              how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert
              their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and
              drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent
              representation. For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait
              associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan
              [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of
              drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a
              low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on
              tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
              [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use
              a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach
              [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003]
              that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
              preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways).
              When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression
              space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as
              hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with
              keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood
              cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and
              neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types.
              Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and
              heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
              associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease
              states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in
              PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic
              Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III
              [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our
              replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust
              trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even
              when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not
              reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene
              approach, our module-based method also better predicts
              FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific
              pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action
              of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known
              immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests
              that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease
              relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the
              phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
              with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
              with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders.
              In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with
              different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes
              that act together to carry out different functions in specific
              cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and
              interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can
              prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate
              targets even when known single gene associations are not detected.
              The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation
              of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract mechanistic
              insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding
              of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.

            the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular
            traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease
            prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to
            examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally,
            exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters
            associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch
            involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and
            neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, instead of considering
            single genes associated with different complex traits, PhenoPLIER
            incorporates groups of genes that act together to carry out
            different functions in specific cell types. This approach improves
            robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and
            here we show how it can prioritize alternative and potentially more
            promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations
            are not detected. The approach represents a conceptual shift in the
            interpretation of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract
            mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance the
            understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.

              In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative approach that
              integrates gene modules into genetic studies. Our method allows
              for the analysis of multiple data modalities within a single
              representation. We demonstrate that this module perspective can
              reveal how groups of functionally related genes influence complex
              traits, identify shared and distinct transcriptomic properties
              among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations affect
              gene activity to exert their effects. 


              To achieve this, we map gene-trait associations and drug-induced
              transcriptional responses into a common latent representation. We
              integrate thousands of gene-trait associations from TWAS in
              PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083] and transcriptional
              profiles of drugs from LINCS L1000
              [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049] into a low-dimensional space
              learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of
              RNA-seq samples from recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003;
              @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]. We use a latent representation defined by
              a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1;
              @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with
              certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align
              with prior knowledge (pathways). 


              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, such as hypothyroidism
              with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry
              measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types,
              plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders
              with different brain cell types. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
              our module-based approach can identify modules associated with
              cell types under specific stimuli or disease states, and replicate
              significant module-trait associations in the Electronic Medical
              Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III
              [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225].


              We also performed a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in
              HepG2 cells and observed more robust trait associations with
              modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known
              to be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide
              significance. Our module-based method also better predicted
              FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific
              pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action
              of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known
              immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests
              that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease
              relationships than individual genes.


              Finally, we explored the phenotype-module space and revealed
              stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including
              a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune,
              and neuropsychiatric disorders. Our approach represents a
              conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies and has
              the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical
              associations to enhance our understanding of complex diseases and
              their therapeutic modalities.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining
              the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the
              following paragraph from the Introduction section.


              Input paragraph: Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach
              that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The
              flexibility of our method allows integrating different data
              modalities into the same representation for a joint analysis. We
              show that this module perspective can infer how groups of
              functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared
              and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict
              how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert
              their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and
              drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent
              representation. For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait
              associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan
              [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of
              drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a
              low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on
              tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
              [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use
              a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach
              [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003]
              that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
              preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways).
              When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression
              space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as
              hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with
              keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood
              cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and
              neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types.
              Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and
              heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
              associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease
              states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in
              PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic
              Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III
              [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our
              replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust
              trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even
              when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not
              reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene
              approach, our module-based method also better predicts
              FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific
              pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action
              of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known
              immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests
              that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease
              relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the
              phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
              with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
              with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders.
              In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with
              different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes
              that act together to carry out different functions in specific

              We present PhenoPLIER, an approach that integrates gene expression
              data with other omnigenomic datasets to identify functional
              modules associated with genetic studies. Our method allows for a
              joint analysis of different data modalities and can infer how
              groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits. We

              certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align
              with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait
              associations to this reduced expression space, we observe that

              identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli
              or disease states.


              Our approach has several advantages over traditional single-gene
              studies. Firstly, it improves robustness in detecting and

              Our work has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from
              statistical associations to enhance the understanding of complex
              diseases and their therapeutic modalities.

              We propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach that offers a gene
              module perspective for genetic studies. The flexibility of our
              method allows us to combine different data modalities into the
              same representation for joint analysis. We demonstrate that this
              module perspective can identify how groups of functionally-related
              genes influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct
              transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict how
              pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert
              their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and
              drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent
              representation by integrating thousands of gene-trait associations
              (from TWAS in PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and
              transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000
              [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space
              learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of
              RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003;
              @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). Our method uses a latent representation
              defined by a matrix factorization approach
              [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003]
              that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
              preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways).
              We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene
              modules expressed in relevant cell types, such as hypothyroidism
              with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry
              measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types,
              plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders
              with different brain cell types. Our method can also identify
              modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or
              disease states, which can improve robustness in detecting and
              interpreting genetic associations. Additionally, we perform a
              CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells and
              observe more robust trait associations with modules than with
              individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in
              lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance. This
              suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine
              drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, we
              explore the phenotype-module space and observe stable trait
              clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex
              branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and
              neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers a new
              approach to gene studies that considers groups of genes that act
              together in specific cell types. This method improves robustness
              in detecting and interpreting genetic associations and has the
              potential to prioritize alternative and potentially more promising
              candidate targets even when known single-gene associations are not
              detected.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining
              the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the
              following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance
              clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The
              revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a
              Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure
              begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context),
              progresses through what is known from the literature (Content),
              and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap your
              manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1)
              preserve the original information as much as possible, with
              minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to
              scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the
              original text. These references are crucial for academic integrity
              and may appear in formats like "[@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]", and 4) the
              revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following
              the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.

              associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan
              [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of
              drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a
              low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on
              tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
              [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use
              a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach
              [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003]
              that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
              preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways).
              When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression
              space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as
              hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with

              cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and
              neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types.
              Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and
              heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
              associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease
              states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in
              PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic
              Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III
              [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our
              replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust
              trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even
              when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not
              reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene
              approach, our module-based method also better predicts
              FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific
              pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action
              of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known
              immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests
              that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease
              relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the
              phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
              with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
              with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders.
              In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with
              different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes
              that act together to carry out different functions in specific
              cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and
              interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can
              prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate
              targets even when known single gene associations are not detected.
              The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation
              of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract mechanistic
              insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding
              of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.

              representation. For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait
              associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan
              [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of
              drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a
              low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on
              tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
              [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use
              a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach

              that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
              preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways).
              When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression
              space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as

              associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease
              states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in
              PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic
              Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III
              [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our
              replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust
              trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even
              when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not
              reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene
              approach, our module-based method also better predicts
              FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific
              pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action
              of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known
              immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests
              that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease
              relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the
              phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
              with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
              with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders.
              In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with
              different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes
              that act together to carry out different functions in specific
              cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and
              interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can
              prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate
              targets even when known single gene associations are not detected.
              The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation
              of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract mechanistic
              insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding
              of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.

              We propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach that provides a gene
              module perspective for genetic studies. Our method integrates
              different data modalities into the same representation for joint
              analysis, allowing us to infer how groups of functionally-related
              genes influence complex traits and predict how pharmacological
              perturbations affect genes' activity.


              In this study, we map gene-trait associations and drug-induced
              transcriptional responses into a common latent representation
              using public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq
              samples from different cell types and diseases. We use a matrix
              factorization approach to extract gene modules with certain
              sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with
              prior knowledge (pathways).


              Our results show that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, such as
              hypothyroidism with T cells and neuropsychiatric disorders with
              different brain cell types. We also identify modules associated
              with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states, which
              can provide insights into tissue-specific pathophysiological
              mechanisms linked with drug mechanisms.


              Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation in HepG2 cells and observe more robust trait
              associations with modules than with individual genes. This
              improved drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide
              a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than
              individual genes.


              In summary, our approach incorporates groups of
              functionally-related genes that act together in specific cell
              types to carry out different functions. This approach improves
              robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations and
              has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical
              associations to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and
              their therapeutic modalities.

              flexibility of our method allows integrating different data
              modalities into the same representation for a joint analysis. We
              show that this module perspective can infer how groups of
              functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared
              and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict
              how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert
              their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and
              drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent
              representation. For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait
              associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan
              [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of
              drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a
              low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on
              tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
              [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use
              a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach
              [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003]
              that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
              preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways).
              When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression
              space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as
              hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with
              keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood
              cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and
              neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types.
              Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and
              heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules

              replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust

              We introduce PhenoPLIER, an innovative method that combines a gene

              Our approach integrates multiple data modalities into a common

              genes influence complex traits and predict how pharmacological

              thousands of gene-trait associations from TWAS from PhenomeXcan,

              recount2. We use a latent representation defined by matrix
              factorization to extract gene modules with sparsity constraints
              and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge
              (pathways). By mapping disease-associated genes to this reduced
              expression space, we observe significant associations between
              diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              Furthermore, our method can identify modules associated with
              specific stimuli or disease states by leveraging models derived
              from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets. We demonstrate the
              effectiveness of PhenoPLIER through replicating its findings in
              the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase
              III, where we observe that significant module-trait associations
              in our discovery cohort replicated in our replication cohort.
              Additionally, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
              regulation in HepG2 cells and find more robust trait associations
              with modules than with individual genes. Our approach prioritizes
              alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even
              when known single gene associations are not detected, providing a

              PhenoPLIER has the potential to enhance our understanding of

              mechanistic insight from statistical associations.

            perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes
            influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic
            properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological
            perturbations affect genes' activity to exert their effects.
            PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced
            transcriptional responses into a common latent representation. For
            this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations (using TWAS
            from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional
            profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000
            [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space
            learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of
            RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003;
            @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a latent representation defined by a
            matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1;
            @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with
            certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align
            with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait
            associations to this reduced expression space, we observe that
            diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
            relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal
            endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological
            assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose
            tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell
            types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large
            and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
            associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states.
            We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan
            (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records
            and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72;
            @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort).
            Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation
            in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with
            modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to
            be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide
            significance. Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based
            method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by
            capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with
            the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular
            traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease
            prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to
            examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally,
            exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters
            associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch
            involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and
            neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, instead of considering
            single genes associated with different complex traits, PhenoPLIER
            incorporates groups of genes that act together to carry out
            different functions in specific cell types. This approach improves
            robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and
            here we show how it can prioritize alternative and potentially more
            promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations
            are not detected. The approach represents a conceptual shift in the
            interpretation of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract
            mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance the
            understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.

              In this manuscript, we present PhenoPLIER, an omnigenomic approach
              that provides a gene module perspective for genetic studies. Our
              method integrates different data modalities into the same
              representation for joint analysis, allowing us to infer how groups
              of functionally-related genes influence complex traits and predict
              how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity. We map
              gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses
              into a common latent representation by integrating thousands of
              gene-trait associations from TWAS from PhenomeXcan

              recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838].
              We use a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization
              approach that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity
              constraints and preferences for those that align with prior
              knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait associations to this
              reduced expression space, we observe that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types. Our method can identify modules associated with cell
              types under specific stimuli or disease states, providing a better
              means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes.
              We show how PhenoPLIER prioritizes alternative and potentially
              more promising candidate targets even when known single gene
              associations are not detected. This approach represents a

              that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
              preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways).
              When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression
              space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as
              hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with

              cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and
              neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types.
              Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and
              heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
              associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease

              PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic
              Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III

              replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust
              trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even
              when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not
              reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene
              approach, our module-based method also better predicts
              FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific
              pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action
              of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known
              immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests
              that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease
              relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the
              phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
              with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
              with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders.
              In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with
              different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes
              that act together to carry out different functions in specific

              targets even when known single gene associations are not detected.
              The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation

              We propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach that provides a gene
              module perspective for genetic studies. Our method allows
              integrating different data modalities into the same representation
              for joint analysis. We demonstrate that this module perspective
              can infer how groups of functionally-related genes influence
              complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic
              properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological
              perturbations affect genes' activity to exert their effects.
              PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced
              transcriptional responses into a common latent representation. For
              this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations (using
              TWAS from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and
              transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000
              [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space
              learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of
              RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003;
              @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a latent representation defined by
              a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1;
              @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with
              certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align
              with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait
              associations to this reduced expression space, we observe that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells,
              corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements,
              hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids
              with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different
              brain cell types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models
              derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also
              identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli
              or disease states. We observe that significant module-trait
              associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in
              the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase
              III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225]
              (our replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen
              to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust
              trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even
              when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not
              reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene
              approach, our module-based method also better predicts
              FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific
              pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action
              of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known
              immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests
              that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease
              relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the
              phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
              with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
              with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders.
              In summary, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act
              together to carry out different functions in specific cell types.
              This approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting
              genetic associations, and here we show how it can prioritize
              alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even
              when known single gene associations are not detected. The approach
              represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic
              studies. It has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from
              statistical associations to enhance the understanding of complex
              diseases and their therapeutic modalities.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining
              the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the
              following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance
              clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The
              revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a
              Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure
              begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context),
              progresses through what is known from the literature (Content),
              and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap your
              manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1)
              preserve the original information as much as possible, with
              minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to
              scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the
              original text. These references are crucial for academic integrity
              and may appear in formats like "[@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]", and 4) the
              revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following
              the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.


              Input paragraph: Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach
              that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The
              flexibility of our method allows integrating different data
              modalities into the same representation for a joint analysis. We
              show that this module perspective can infer how groups of
              functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared
              and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict
              how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert
              their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and
              drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent
              representation. For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait
              associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan
              [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of
              drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a
              low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on
              tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
              [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use
              a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach
              [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003]
              that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
              preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways).
              When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression
              space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as
              hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with
              keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood
              cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and
              neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types.
              Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and
              heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
              associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease
              states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in
              PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic
              Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III
              [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our
              replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust
              trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even
              when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not
              reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene
              approach, our module-based method also better predicts
              FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific
              pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action
              of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known

              that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease

              with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
              with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders.
              In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with
              different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes
              that act together to carry out different functions in specific
              cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and
