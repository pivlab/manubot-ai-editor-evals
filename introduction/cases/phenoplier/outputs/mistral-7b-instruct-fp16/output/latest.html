Gene networks work in context-specific ways to carry out different functions, and variations in these genes can alter their functional roles and affect disease-relevant biological processes. To understand how genes influence complex traits, we must mechanistically understand expression regulation across different cell types. Previous studies have described various regulatory DNA elements, including genetic effects on gene expression across different tissues. Integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data has improved the identification of these transcriptional mechanisms, which are commonly dysregulated in tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology.

Context: Genes work together in context-specific networks to carry out different functions.

Content: Variations in these genes can change their functional role and, at a higher level, affect disease-relevant biological processes. Determining how genes influence complex traits requires mechanistically understanding expression regulation across different cell types. Previous studies have described different regulatory DNA elements including genetic effects on gene expression across different tissues. Integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data has improved the identification of these transcriptional mechanisms that, when dysregulated, commonly result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology.

Conclusion: Our manuscript addresses the knowledge gap by projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns to highlight disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. This gap in understanding can be addressed by combining TWAS with other methods such as functional genomics and gene co-expression analysis to identify disease-related pathways and therapeutic targets [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9].

In summary, while TWAS is a valuable tool for identifying disease etiology at the transcriptome level, it does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. By combining TWAS with functional genomics and gene co-expression analysis, we can identify disease-related pathways and therapeutic targets that may be missed by individual gene-level analyses. This approach has the potential to enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms and drug repurposing, ultimately leading to more effective treatments for complex traits.

Given the availability of gene expression data across several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], a useful method for identifying biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS tests whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these approaches have been highly successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] and disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w]. However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. This gap in understanding can be addressed by combining TWAS with other methods such as functional genomics and gene co-expression analysis to identify disease-related pathways and therapeutic targets [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9].

In summary, while TWAS is a valuable tool for identifying disease etiology at the transcriptome level, it does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. By combining TWAS with functional genomics and gene co-expression analysis, we can identify disease-related pathways and therapeutic targets that may be missed by individual gene-level analyses. This approach has the potential to enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms and drug repurposing, ultimately leading to more effective treatments for complex traits.

However, TWAS operates at the individual gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the network level.

In summary, TWAS is a powerful tool for identifying biological processes from gene expression data. While it has been successful in disease etiology, risk prediction, and drug repurposing, its limitations lie in its focus on individual genes, which does not capture complex interactions at the network level. Future research should explore ways to integrate TWAS with other approaches to better understand these interactions and their role in disease development and treatment.

Context: Gene expression data is available across various tissues, providing a rich source of information for studying biological processes.

Content: The transcription-wide association study (TWAS) is an effective approach to identify these processes by integrating expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data. TWAS tests whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases, and has been highly successful in disease etiology at the transcriptome level as well as in disease-risk prediction, drug repurposing, and other related tasks.

Conclusion: While TWAS works at the individual gene level, it does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. Therefore, there is a need to develop methods that can account for these interactions and provide a comprehensive understanding of biological processes. This manuscript aims to address this gap in knowledge by proposing a novel approach that integrates both gene-level and network-level data to identify complex interactions involved in disease etiology.

Context: Gene expression data is available across various tissues, providing a rich source of information for studying biological processes.

Content: The transcription-wide association study (TWAS) is an effective approach to identify these processes by integrating expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data. TWAS tests whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases, and has been highly successful in disease etiology at the transcriptome level as well as in disease-risk prediction, drug repurposing, and other related tasks.

Conclusion: While TWAS works at the individual gene level, it does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. Therefore, there is a need to develop methods that can account for these interactions and provide a comprehensive understanding of biological processes. This manuscript aims to address this gap in knowledge by proposing a novel approach that integrates both gene-level and network-level data to identify complex interactions involved in disease etiology.

## Context

The availability of gene expression data across multiple tissues has provided a wealth of information for understanding biological processes and identifying disease risk factors.

## Content

To effectively analyze this data, researchers have developed transcription-wide association studies (TWAS), which integrate expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS tests whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases. These approaches have been highly successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level, predicting disease risk, and identifying drug repurposing opportunities.

## Conclusion

While TWAS has provided valuable insights into complex biological processes, it works at the individual gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. Therefore, there is a need for further research to develop more advanced methods that can account for these interactions and provide a more comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms.

## Context

The availability of gene expression data across multiple tissues has provided a wealth of information for understanding biological processes and identifying disease risk factors.

## Content

To effectively analyze this data, researchers have developed transcription-wide association studies (TWAS), which integrate expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS tests whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases. These approaches have been highly successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level, predicting disease risk, and identifying drug repurposing opportunities.

## Conclusion

While TWAS has provided valuable insights into complex biological processes, it works at the individual gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. Therefore, there is a need for further research to develop more advanced methods that can account for these interactions and provide a more comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms.

Context: Transcriptomic analyses of genetic variants and human diseases have been instrumental in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level.
Content: Functional genomics approaches such as transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) have been highly successful in identifying disease risk factors, predicting drug response, and repurposing drugs [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367].

Conclusion: Our manuscript addresses this gap by using gene co-expression analysis to identify disease mechanisms that involve multiple genes.

**Context:** Genetic studies have long been an important tool in understanding disease etiology and identifying potential therapeutic targets. However, these approaches often rely on testing for associations between genetic variants and human diseases, which can be challenging to interpret at the transcriptome level.

**Content:** Functional genomics, such as gene co-expression analysis, has emerged as a powerful approach to identifying biological processes that underlie disease risk and drug response. TWAS (Transcription-wide Association Study) is one such method that integrates eQTLs (Expression Quantitative Trait Loci) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. While TWAS has been highly successful in identifying disease risk genes, it does not capture more complex interactions at the network level.

**Conclusion:** Our manuscript proposes a novel approach that combines gene expression patterns with network analysis to identify disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By clustering complex traits based on their genetic and functional associations, we hope to provide new insights into disease pathways and potential therapeutic targets. Our study highlights an important gap in the literature by integrating gene expression data with network analysis to capture more complex interactions at the network level.

TWAS is a scientific approach that focuses on identifying perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms that mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases. This method has been highly successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level, predicting disease risk, and repurposing drugs [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. However, the focus on individual genes does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. To address this gap, TWAS integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. This method has shown promise in identifying biological processes across several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9].

In summary, TWAS is a valuable tool for identifying perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms that mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases. While this method has been highly successful in understanding disease etiology, it does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. By integrating eQTLs data, TWAS provides a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings and has shown promise in identifying biological processes across several tissues.

TWAS is a scientific approach that focuses on identifying perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms that mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases. This method has been highly successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level, predicting disease risk, and repurposing drugs [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. However, the focus on individual genes does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. To address this gap, TWAS integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. This method has shown promise in identifying biological processes across several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9].

In summary, TWAS is a valuable tool for identifying perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms that mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases. While this method has been highly successful in understanding disease etiology, it does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. By integrating eQTLs data, TWAS provides a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings and has shown promise in identifying biological processes across several tissues. Further research is needed to fully understand the potential of TWAS and its limitations.

## Context

TWAS is a powerful method used in genetic studies to investigate the relationship between genetic variants and human diseases. It relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate this association.

## Content

The literature has shown that TWAS approaches have been highly successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level, predicting disease risk (polygenic scores), and repurposing drugs [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. However, one limitation of TWAS is that it works at the individual gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the network level.

## Conclusion

In this manuscript, we propose a novel approach to overcome this limitation by integrating gene co-expression data and clustering of complex traits. Our method provides a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings and highlights therapeutic targets for drug repurposing. By combining functional genomics with gene expression patterns, our study sheds light on the etiology of diseases and opens up new avenues for drug discovery.

Conclusion: While TWAS is an effective approach at the individual gene level, it does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. Therefore, there is a knowledge gap that needs to be addressed in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and risk prediction. Addressing this gap will require the development of new methods that can integrate network-level data into TWAS analyses.

TWAS is a scientific approach that aims to understand the association between genetic variants and human diseases by testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate this relationship.

## Content
The literature suggests that TWAS has been highly successful in disease etiology at the transcriptome level, as well as in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) and drug repurposing tasks. One of the advantages of TWAS is the availability of gene expression data across several tissues, which makes it an effective approach to identify biological processes. However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the network level.

## Conclusion
In summary, TWAS is a valuable tool for understanding disease etiology and predicting disease risk, but its limitations include the inability to capture more complex interactions at the network level. Further research is needed to develop methods that can integrate gene expression data across tissues and provide a comprehensive view of disease mechanisms.

**Context:** The study of genetic associations and their role in human diseases has been a topic of interest for many years.

**Content:** Functional genomics techniques such as transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been highly successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level and predicting disease risk through polygenic scores. Additionally, TWAS has also been used to identify potential therapeutic targets for drug repurposing. However, the approach of TWAS only works at the individual gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the network level.

**Conclusion:** The current manuscript proposes a novel approach that combines TWAS with gene co-expression analysis to identify biological processes involved in disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach will provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings by capturing more complex interactions at the network level, which can lead to better understanding of disease mechanisms and the development of new therapeutic targets.

Context: Gene expression data has become increasingly available across various tissues, providing a valuable resource for understanding biological processes at the transcriptome level.

Content: However, traditional approaches such as transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) only provide a mechanistic interpretation of genetic variants and their association with diseases at the individual gene level. This approach does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. TWAS relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases, which has been highly successful in disease etiology, risk prediction, drug repurposing, and other tasks.

Conclusion: While TWAS is a valuable tool for understanding biological processes at the transcriptome level, it does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. Therefore, there is a need to develop new approaches that can provide a comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and risk prediction at the network level.

Context: Gene expression data has become increasingly available across various tissues, providing a wealth of information for studying complex biological processes.

Content: Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) have emerged as an effective approach to identify gene expression patterns associated with genetic variants and human diseases. However, these studies focus on individual genes and do not capture the more complex interactions at the network level. TWAS relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and diseases, which has been successful in disease etiology studies, risk prediction (polygenic scores), and drug repurposing tasks.

Conclusion: While TWAS has provided valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms at the transcriptome level, a more comprehensive approach that captures network-level interactions is needed to fully understand the complexities of genetic associations with diseases. Our manuscript aims to address this gap by integrating gene co-expression analysis with functional genomics data to identify novel therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities for various complex traits.

Conclusion: While TWAS has provided valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms at the transcriptome level, a more comprehensive approach that captures network-level interactions is needed to fully understand the complexities of genetic associations with diseases. Our manuscript aims to address this gap by integrating gene co-expression analysis with functional genomics data to identify novel therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities for various complex traits.

**Context:** Gene expression data has been widely collected across various tissues, providing a wealth of information for studying biological processes at the transcriptome level.

**Content:** Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) have emerged as an effective approach to identify gene expression patterns associated with human diseases by integrating eQTLs data. TWAS works by testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and diseases, providing a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. However, TWAS only operates at the individual gene level, which fails to capture more complex interactions at the network level.

**Conclusion:** While TWAS has been highly successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level and in disease-risk prediction, drug repurposing, and other tasks, it does not account for more complex interactions within gene regulatory networks. Our manuscript aims to address this knowledge gap by developing a novel approach that integrates both gene expression and network data to identify disease-associated biological processes at the network level.

Context: Gene expression data are increasingly available across various tissues, providing valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying human diseases. However, these datasets often contain complex interactions between genes that cannot be fully captured by analyzing individual gene expression patterns.

Content: Functional genomics approaches, such as transcription-wide association studies (TWAS), have been successful in identifying genetic associations with disease etiology and drug mechanisms at the transcriptome level. TWAS integrates eQTLs data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings, allowing researchers to test whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases.

Conclusion: While TWAS has been successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level and predicting disease risk through polygenic scores, it does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. Our manuscript aims to address this gap by projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns, highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms at a systems level. By leveraging clustering of complex traits, we aim to uncover novel therapeutic targets for diseases that are not well understood or have limited treatment options.

Context: The availability of gene expression data across various tissues provides a valuable resource for identifying biological processes related to human diseases. However, traditional approaches like transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) only focus on individual genes and do not capture the complexity of interactions at the network level.

Content: TWAS uses eQTLs data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings, but it works at the individual gene level. This approach has been highly successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level and in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) and drug repurposing tasks.

Conclusion: Our manuscript aims to address this gap by projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns, which highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms at a network level. By combining eQTLs data with clustering of complex traits, we can identify disease-associated genes and pathways that may not have been captured by traditional approaches. This will provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of human diseases and lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets.

PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent representation. For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]).

When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort).

We observe more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance.

This improved drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected.

Context: Genetic studies have traditionally focused on single genes, but recent advances in technology and methodology have enabled a more holistic approach to understanding gene function and disease mechanisms. 
Content: PhenoPLIER is an omnigenic method that integrates different data modalities into a common latent representation for joint analysis. This module perspective allows for the inference of how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detection of shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and prediction of how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples. The method uses a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). 
Conclusion: PhenoPLIER's module perspective provides a more robust and interpretable approach to genetic studies. By analyzing groups of genes that act together in specific cell types, PhenoPLIER improves the detection and interpretation of genetic associations. The method can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER's drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Overall, PhenoPLIER represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies and has the potential to enhance our understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.

When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort).

We observe more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act together to carry out different functions in specific cell types.

We propose an omnigenic approach called PhenoPLIER that integrates gene expression data with other types of molecular and clinical data to study genetic associations and drug mechanisms. Our method allows for a joint analysis of multiple data modalities, including genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, and clinical data, into a common latent space. We show that this module perspective can identify functional relationships between genes and complex traits, detect shared and distinct molecular properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations affect gene activity to exert their effects.

To achieve these goals, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations from TWAS in PhenomeXcan with transcriptional profiles of drugs from LINCS L1000 into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples. We use a latent representation defined by matrix factorization that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we observe significant correlations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.

We also show that PhenoPLIER can identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. Our approach has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance our understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities. For example, we observe that significant module-trait associations in our discovery cohort replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III, suggesting that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells and observe more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance.

In conclusion, our omnigenic approach can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected, providing a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. PhenoPLIER has the potential to improve robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and its ability to integrate multiple data modalities makes it a valuable tool for drug discovery and precision medicine.

In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative approach that integrates gene modules into genetic studies. Our method allows for the analysis of multiple data modalities within a single representation. We demonstrate that this module perspective can reveal how groups of functionally related genes influence complex traits, identify shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations affect gene activity to exert their effects. 

To achieve this, we map gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent representation. We integrate thousands of gene-trait associations from TWAS in PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083] and transcriptional profiles of drugs from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049] into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples from recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]. We use a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). 

We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our module-based approach can identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states, and replicate significant module-trait associations in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225].

We also performed a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells and observed more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance. Our module-based method also better predicted FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes.

Finally, we explored the phenotype-module space and revealed stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Our approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies and has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance our understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.

In this study, we present PhenoPLIER, an innovative approach that integrates gene modules into genetic studies. Our method allows for the analysis of multiple data modalities within a single representation. We demonstrate that this module perspective can reveal how groups of functionally related genes influence complex traits, identify shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations affect gene activity to exert their effects. 

To achieve this, we map gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent representation. We integrate thousands of gene-trait associations from TWAS in PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083] and transcriptional profiles of drugs from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049] into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples from recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838].

We present PhenoPLIER, an approach that integrates gene expression data with other omnigenomic datasets to identify functional modules associated with genetic studies. Our method allows for a joint analysis of different data modalities and can infer how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits. We show that this module perspective can detect shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, predict how pharmacological perturbations affect genes&#39; activity to exert their effects, and map gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent representation.

In our work, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations (from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. Furthermore, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states.

Our approach has several advantages over traditional single-gene studies. Firstly, it improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations by incorporating groups of genes that act together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. Secondly, it can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected. Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Our work has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.

Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells and observe more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes. This improved drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes.

In summary, our approach incorporates groups of functionally-related genes that act together in specific cell types to carry out different functions. This approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations and has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.

We introduce PhenoPLIER, an innovative method that combines a gene module perspective with omnigenic analysis for genetic studies. Our approach integrates multiple data modalities into a common latent representation to infer how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits and predict how pharmacological perturbations affect genes&#39; activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a low-dimensional space using thousands of gene-trait associations from TWAS from PhenomeXcan, transcriptional profiles of drugs from LINCS L1000, and public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples from recount2. We use a latent representation defined by matrix factorization to extract gene modules with sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). By mapping disease-associated genes to this reduced expression space, we observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore, our method can identify modules associated with specific stimuli or disease states by leveraging models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PhenoPLIER through replicating its findings in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III, where we observe that significant module-trait associations in our discovery cohort replicated in our replication cohort. Additionally, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells and find more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes. Our approach prioritizes alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected, providing a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. PhenoPLIER has the potential to enhance our understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities by extracting mechanistic insight from statistical associations.
