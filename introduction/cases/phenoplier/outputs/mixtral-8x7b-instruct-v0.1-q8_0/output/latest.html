Context: Genes operate in intricate networks, executing various functions in a context-specific manner [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259]. Alterations in these genes can modify their functional roles and impact disease-relevant biological processes [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6].

Context: Genes function in a coordinated manner within context-specific networks to execute various cellular processes [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259]. Variations in these genes can lead to changes in their functional roles, ultimately impacting disease-relevant biological mechanisms [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6]. A comprehensive understanding of how genes influence complex traits relies on elucidating the regulation of gene expression across different cell types, which can subsequently inform the development of improved treatments [@doi:10.1038/ng.3314; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008489].

Content: Previous research has identified various regulatory DNA elements, including genetic effects on gene expression across different tissues [@doi:10.1038/nature11247; @doi:10.1038/nature14248; @doi:10.1038/nature12787; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-03145-z; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776].

Conclusion: Despite these advances, a knowledge gap remains regarding the comprehensive understanding of gene regulatory networks and their roles in complex trait determination. Our manuscript aims to address this gap by investigating the intricate relationship between genes and their regulation across various cell types, shedding light on novel aspects of disease-relevant biological processes that can inform the development of targeted treatments.

Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues has paved the way for innovative approaches to identify biological processes associated with diseases. 

Content: A prominent method in this regard is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which amalgamates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic interpretation of GWAS findings [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. TWAS functions by examining whether disturbances in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367].

Conclusion: Despite the success of TWAS at the individual gene level, it fails to capture more intricate interactions at the network level. Our manuscript addresses this knowledge gap by employing a systems biology approach that considers gene co-expression and clustering of complex traits, thereby refining the projection of genetic associations through gene expression patterns and shedding light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

TWAS functions by examining whether disturbances in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This approach has not only enhanced our understanding of disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also proven beneficial in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing tasks [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].

Conclusion: Despite the success of TWAS at the individual gene level, it fails to capture more intricate interactions at the network level. Our manuscript addresses this knowledge gap by employing a systems biology approach that considers gene co-expression and clustering of complex traits, thereby refining the projection of genetic associations through gene expression patterns and shedding light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues has paved the way for novel methods to identify biological processes associated with diseases. 

Content: A prominent approach is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic understanding of GWAS findings by testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between genetic variants and human diseases. TWAS has been successful not only in elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome level but also in predicting disease risk (polygenic scores) and drug repurposing tasks. However, this method focuses on individual gene-level analysis, thereby overlooking more intricate interactions at the network level.

Conclusion: Despite TWAS&#39;s success in identifying gene-level associations, there is a need to explore complex interactions at the network level to enhance our understanding of disease etiology and improve risk prediction and drug repurposing strategies. Our manuscript addresses this knowledge gap by proposing a novel approach that integrates TWAS with network analysis techniques.

Content: A prominent method in this regard is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which amalgamates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic interpretation of GWAS findings by testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between genetic variants and diseases [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. TWAS has proven successful in elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome level, predicting disease risk, and repurposing drugs [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433; @doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w; @doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. However, TWAS operates at the individual gene level, thereby overlooking more intricate interactions at the network level.

Conclusion: Our study aims to address this knowledge gap by projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns, thereby highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms while considering complex interactions at the network level. This approach will facilitate a deeper understanding of the clustering of complex traits and therapeutic targets in the context of functional genomics.

Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues has paved the way for novel approaches to identify biological processes underlying human diseases. One such method, the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), has garnered significant attention due to its ability to offer mechanistic insights into GWAS findings by integrating expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data.

Conclusion: Despite the success of TWAS in identifying individual gene contributions to disease, it does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. Bridging this knowledge gap requires the development and implementation of methods that can model these intricate relationships, thereby advancing our understanding of disease pathophysiology and informing novel therapeutic strategies.

Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues has paved the way for novel approaches to identify biological processes underlying human diseases. 

Content: A prominent method in this regard is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which amalgamates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic interpretation of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) findings [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9].

Conclusion: Despite TWAS&#39;s individual gene-level focus, which has proven beneficial in several aspects, it fails to capture more intricate network-level interactions.

In summary, TWAS has proven to be a valuable tool in understanding disease etiology, predicting disease risk, and repurposing drugs through the examination of gene regulatory mechanisms. The availability of gene expression data across multiple tissues has further enhanced the utility of TWAS. Nevertheless, the current focus on individual genes leaves a gap in comprehending more complex network-level interactions, which our manuscript aims to address by projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns and highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

The abundance of gene expression data across various tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9] has led to the development of TWAS, which combines expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic understanding of GWAS findings. Despite its utility, TWAS operates at the individual gene level, thereby overlooking more intricate interactions at the network level. This knowledge gap underscores the need for methods that can capture complex genetic interactions in human diseases, which is a key focus of our manuscript.

Conclusion: Bridging this knowledge gap, our manuscript introduces a novel approach that projects genetic associations through gene expression patterns to uncover complex disease etiology and drug mechanisms, specifically addressing the limitations of TWAS by considering gene co-expression and clustering of complex traits within functional genomics. This advancement is expected to significantly impact therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing endeavors.

Conclusion: Bridging this knowledge gap, our manuscript introduces a novel approach that projects genetic associations through gene expression patterns to uncover complex disease etiology and drug mechanisms, specifically addressing the limitations of TWAS by considering gene co-expression and clustering of complex traits within functional genomics. This advancement is expected to significantly impact therapeutic target identification and drug repurposing endeavors.

Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states.

We introduce PhenoPLIER, a comprehensive method that offers an omnigenic view for genetic studies by considering gene modules. Our approach integrates various data modalities into a unified representation, facilitating joint analysis. We demonstrate that this module-based perspective can infer how groups of functionally related genes influence complex traits, identify shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict the impact of pharmacological perturbations on gene activity.

PhenoPLIER represents gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses in a shared latent space. To achieve this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations from TWAS in PhenomeXcan and transcriptional profiles of drugs from LINCS L1000 into a low-dimensional space, which is learned from publicly available gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples in recount2. We use a matrix factorization approach to define the latent representation, focusing on extracting gene modules with sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (e.g., pathways).

When mapping gene-trait associations into this reduced expression space, we observe significant connections between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Examples include hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER can identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states.

We validate our approach by comparing significant module-trait associations in the discovery cohort (PhenomeXcan) with those in the replication cohort (Electronic Medical Records and Genomics network phase III). Our results indicate that modules provide a more robust means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes.

Additionally, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We find that modules have stronger trait associations than individual genes, even when single genes involved in lipid metabolism do not reach genome-wide significance. Our module-based method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms related to the mechanism of action of drugs.

Exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes acting together in specific cell types, enhancing robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations. This approach offers the potential to extract mechanistic insights from statistical associations, ultimately improving our understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.

**Context:** Genetic studies have traditionally focused on individual genes, but recent advancements in functional genomics suggest that a more comprehensive view of gene networks could provide valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms. 

**Content:** We introduce PhenoPLIER, an &#39;omnigenic&#39; method that integrates different data modalities into a joint analysis by representing them in a shared latent space. This approach allows us to infer how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict the effects of pharmacological perturbations on gene activity. By mapping gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into this common latent representation, we observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. For instance, hypothyroidism is associated with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. Our method can also identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. We validate our findings by replicating significant module-trait associations in the eMERGE network phase III from our discovery cohort, PhenomeXcan. Furthermore, a CRISPR screen in HepG2 cells reveals more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, suggesting that modules may offer a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes.

**Conclusion:** By incorporating groups of genes acting together in specific cell types, PhenoPLIER improves the robustness of detecting and interpreting genetic associations. This novel approach provides a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies, enabling the extraction of mechanistic insights from statistical associations to enhance our understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.

Furthermore, PhenoPLIER can identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states, revealing robust trait associations with modules compared to individual genes.

**Conclusion:** Our module-based method better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs. This improved drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. By incorporating groups of genes that act together in specific cell types, PhenoPLIER improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, potentially extracting mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.

**Context:** Genetic studies often focus on individual genes, yet complex traits frequently involve interactions among multiple genes. To address this, we introduce PhenoPLIER, an &quot;omnigenic&quot; approach that considers groups of functionally-related genes. 

**Content:** PhenoPLIER integrates different data types into a shared representation for joint analysis, enabling the inference of how gene modules influence complex traits and predicting pharmacological effects on gene activity. It maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent space using thousands of gene-trait associations from TWAS (PhenomeXcan) and transcriptional profiles of drugs from LINCS L1000, all integrated into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data. When applied to various diseases and traits, PhenoPLIER reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. It also identifies modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states, and replicates significant module-trait associations in an independent cohort (eMERGE). A CRISPR screen shows that modules better predict drug-disease links than individual genes by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms.

**Conclusion:** PhenoPLIER&#39;s module-based method provides a more robust and interpretable approach to genetic associations compared to single-gene methods. By incorporating groups of genes acting together in specific cell types, it can prioritize alternative candidate targets, even when known single gene associations are not detected. This shift in interpretation has the potential to extract mechanistic insights from statistical associations, ultimately enhancing our understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.

We demonstrate that the module perspective can elucidate how groups of functionally-related genes impact complex traits, reveal shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict the effects of pharmacological perturbations on gene activity.

We employ a latent representation based on matrix factorization [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those aligning with prior knowledge (e.g., pathways).

We observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, such as hypothyroidism with T cells, keratometry measurements with corneal endothelial cells, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, adipose tissue with plasma lipids, and neuropsychiatric disorders with various brain cell types. Moreover, PhenoPLIER can identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states.

Our findings indicate that significant module-trait associations in the discovery cohort (PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225]) replicate in the replication cohort (Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III). A CRISPR screen for lipid regulation in HepG2 cells reveals more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even when single genes involved in lipid metabolism do not reach genome-wide significance.

Our module-based method outperforms single-gene approaches in predicting FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms related to drug mechanisms of action (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism). This enhanced drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may serve as a better tool for examining drug-disease relationships than individual genes.

Exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. By considering groups of genes acting together in specific cell types, PhenoPLIER enhances robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations. Our approach also highlights alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets when known single gene associations are not detected, offering a paradigm shift for interpreting genetic studies and potential insights into complex disease mechanisms and therapeutic modalities.

**Context:** Genetic studies have traditionally focused on individual genes, often overlooking the complexity of biological systems. However, recent advances in functional genomics and gene co-expression provide a new perspective for understanding genetic associations with complex traits and diseases. 

**Content:** In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, an &#39;omnigenic&#39; approach that offers a gene module viewpoint to genetic studies. By flexibly integrating various data modalities into a joint analysis, PhenoPLIER can infer how groups of functionally-related genes collectively influence complex traits, identify shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict the impact of pharmacological perturbations on gene activity. We achieve this by mapping gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent representation, learned from thousands of gene-trait associations and transcriptional profiles of drugs integrated into a low-dimensional space. Our method aligns gene modules with prior knowledge such as pathways and can identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. We validate our approach using large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, observing significant module-trait associations in both discovery and replication cohorts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PhenoPLIER provides a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs.

**Conclusion:** By incorporating groups of genes acting together in specific cell types, PhenoPLIER enhances robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations. This novel approach offers an opportunity to extract mechanistic insights from statistical associations, thereby advancing our understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities. In the era of precision medicine, this shift in the interpretation of genetic studies has the potential to uncover alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets for drug development and repurposing, especially when known single gene associations are not detected.

To address this limitation, we introduce PhenoPLIER, an &quot;omnigenic&quot; approach that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies.

**Content:** PhenoPLIER integrates different data modalities into a joint analysis by mapping gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent representation. This method leverages thousands of gene-trait associations from TWAS in PhenomeXcan, transcriptional profiles of drugs from LINCS L1000, and public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples from recount2. By using a matrix factorization approach with sparsity constraints and preferences for pathway-aligned gene modules, PhenoPLIER associates diseases with relevant cell types and identifies modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. Our findings reveal significant module-trait associations in both the discovery (PhenomeXcan) and replication (eMERGE network phase III) cohorts. In a CRISPR screen, PhenoPLIER demonstrated more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes in lipid regulation in HepG2 cells, leading to improved drug-disease prediction.

**Conclusion:** By considering groups of genes acting together in specific cell types, PhenoPLIER enhances the interpretation and robustness of genetic associations, revealing stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues. This module-based method offers a conceptual shift in interpreting genetic studies, enabling the extraction of mechanistic insights from statistical associations to enhance our understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.

This method leverages thousands of gene-trait associations from TWAS in PhenomeXcan, transcriptional profiles of drugs from LINCS L1000, and public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples from recount2. By using a matrix factorization approach with sparsity constraints and preferences for pathway-aligned gene modules, PhenoPLIER associates diseases with relevant cell types and identifies modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. Our findings reveal significant module-trait associations in both the discovery (PhenomeXcan) and replication (eMERGE network phase III) cohorts. In a CRISPR screen, PhenoPLIER demonstrated more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes in lipid regulation in HepG2 cells, leading to improved drug-disease prediction.

**Conclusion:** By considering groups of genes acting together in specific cell types, PhenoPLIER enhances the interpretation and robustness of genetic associations, revealing stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues. This module-based method offers a conceptual shift in interpreting genetic studies, enabling the extraction of mechanistic insights from statistical associations to enhance our understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.
