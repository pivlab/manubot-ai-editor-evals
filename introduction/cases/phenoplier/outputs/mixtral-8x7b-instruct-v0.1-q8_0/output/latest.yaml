          In the complex world of genetics, genes do not operate in isolation
          but rather collaborate within context-specific networks to carry out
          various cellular functions [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259].
          Minor alterations in these genes can significantly impact their
          functional roles, ultimately affecting disease-relevant biological
          processes [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6]. A deeper understanding of
          the mechanisms underlying gene expression regulation across different
          cell types is therefore essential for elucidating how genes influence
          complex traits, which could potentially lead to improved treatments
          [@doi:10.1038/ng.3314; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008489].


          Previous studies have identified various regulatory DNA elements,
          including genetic effects on gene expression across different tissues
          [@doi:10.1038/nature11247; @doi:10.1038/nature14248;

          @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3]. Integrating functional genomics data
          and GWAS data has enhanced the identification of transcriptional
          mechanisms, which, when dysregulated, often result in tissue- and cell
          lineage-specific pathology [@pmid:20624743; @pmid:14707169;
          @doi:10.1073/pnas.0810772105]. However, a knowledge gap remains
          regarding the precise role of gene co-expression patterns in disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms [@doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0081-4;
          @doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.04.002; @doi:10.1038/ncomms6890]. This
          manuscript aims to address this gap by projecting genetic associations
          through gene expression patterns, thereby highlighting disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms.

          Context: Genes function in a complex network, and variations in these
          genes can impact disease-relevant biological processes. Understanding
          how genes influence these processes is crucial for developing
          effective treatments. 


          Content: Previous studies have identified different regulatory DNA
          elements and described genetic effects on gene expression across
          various tissues [@doi:10.1038/nature11247; @doi:10.1038/nature14248;
          @doi:10.1038/nature12787; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-03145-z;
          @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776].
          Integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data has improved the
          identification of transcriptional mechanisms that, when dysregulated,
          commonly result in tissue-specific pathology

          @doi:10.1038/ncomms6890].


          Conclusion: However, there is a gap in knowledge regarding the
          mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
          different cell types and its impact on complex traits. This manuscript
          aims to address this gap by investigating how genes influence these
          processes, which could lead to improved treatments [@pmid:19104045;

          Context: Genes function in a complex network, interacting with each
          other to carry out various cellular processes. Variations in these
          genes can have significant implications for disease-relevant
          biological functions. 


          Content: Previous studies have reported different regulatory DNA
          elements and genetic effects on gene expression across various tissues

          Conclusion: Despite these advances, there is still a need to better
          understand the molecular mechanisms underlying gene expression
          regulation in specific cell types and how they contribute to complex
          traits and diseases. This knowledge gap underscores the importance of
          the current study, which aims to elucidate the role of genetic
          variation in shaping gene expression regulation across different cell
          types and its implications for disease pathogenesis.

          Previous research has identified various regulatory DNA elements,

          these mechanisms often leads to tissue- and cell lineage-specific
          pathology [@pmid:20624743; @pmid:14707169;
          @doi:10.1073/pnas.0810772105]. The manuscript at hand aims to
          contribute to this body of knowledge by projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns, thereby highlighting
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms. This approach falls under the
          umbrella terms 'functional genomics' and 'gene co-expression,' and it
          holds promise for identifying therapeutic targets and facilitating
          drug repurposing, particularly for complex traits with clustered
          inheritance patterns.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the
          format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;

          text of a scientific manuscript titled 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' with keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should
          adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion
          (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one
          or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the
          format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript titled 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' with keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity,

          Context: Genes function in a complex network, interacting with each
          other to carry out various biological processes. These genetic
          interactions can be influenced by variations in the genes themselves,
          which may subsequently affect disease-relevant activities.
          Understanding how genes contribute to these processes, particularly in
          the context of complex traits, is essential for improving treatments
          and diagnostics.

          Conclusion: Despite these advances, there remains a need to elucidate
          the specific mechanisms by which genetic variations affect gene
          expression regulation and downstream disease-relevant processes in
          complex traits. This manuscript aims to address this knowledge gap by
          providing novel insights into the relationship between genetic
          variations, gene expression regulation, and their impact on complex
          traits, ultimately paving the way for improved diagnostics and
          treatments.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section.


          Input paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across
          several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify
          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS
          relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms
          mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these
          approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in
          disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)
          [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing
          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks. However, TWAS works at the individual
          gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the
          network level.

          The increasing accessibility of gene expression data across various
          tissues provides a valuable resource for exploring biological
          processes [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;
          @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. In
          this context, transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) have
          emerged as an effective approach for identifying these processes. TWAS
          integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a
          mechanistic interpretation of GWAS findings by testing whether
          perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association

          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This method
          has been highly successful in understanding disease etiology at the
          transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;
          @pmid:31036433] and has also proven beneficial in disease-risk
          prediction (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and
          drug repurposing tasks [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. Nevertheless, TWAS
          primarily operates at the individual gene level, which may overlook
          more intricate interactions at the network level.

          Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues has
          paved the way for novel approaches to identify biological processes
          and understand disease etiology. 


          Content: A prominent method in this regard is the transcription-wide
          association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative
          trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic interpretation of GWAS
          findings [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;
          @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. TWAS
          functions by testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory
          mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human
          diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This
          approach has not only enhanced our understanding of disease etiology
          at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also proven

          Conclusion: Despite the success of TWAS at the individual gene level,
          there remains a need to explore more complex interactions at the
          network level, as current approaches may not fully capture these
          intricate relationships. Bridging this knowledge gap is essential for
          further advancements in genetic studies and functional genomics,
          particularly in relation to gene co-expression, therapeutic targets,
          drug repurposing, and the clustering of complex traits.

          Input paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across
          several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify
          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS
          relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms
          mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these
          approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in
          disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)
          [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing
          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks. However, TWAS works at the individual
          gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the
          network level.

          Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues has
          paved the way for novel analytical methods to identify biological
          processes underlying human diseases. 


          Content: A prominent approach among these is the Transcription-Wide
          Association Study (TWAS), which amalgamates expression Quantitative
          Trait Loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic interpretation of
          Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) findings by testing whether
          perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association
          between genetic variants and diseases. TWAS has proven successful not
          only in elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome level but
          also in predicting disease risk via polygenic scores and facilitating
          drug repurposing tasks. However, TWAS operates primarily at the
          individual gene level, thereby overlooking more intricate interactions
          at the network level.


          Conclusion: Despite its accomplishments, TWAS's focus on individual
          genes leaves a knowledge gap concerning complex interactions at the
          network level. The current manuscript aims to address this gap by
          presenting an innovative method that captures these interactions and
          improves our understanding of disease etiology.

          underlying human diseases. 


          Content: A prominent method in this domain is the transcription-wide
          association study (TWAS) (@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9). By integrating expression
          quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data, TWAS offers a mechanistic
          interpretation for genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings,
          testing whether gene regulatory mechanism perturbations mediate the
          link between genetic variants and diseases
          (@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367). Such
          approaches have significantly advanced our understanding of disease
          etiology at the transcriptome level and contributed to disease-risk
          prediction (polygenic scores) (@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w) and
          drug repurposing tasks (@doi:10.1038/nn.4618).


          Conclusion: Despite these successes, TWAS focuses on individual gene
          level associations, thereby overlooking more intricate interactions at
          the network level. This knowledge gap necessitates the exploration of
          methods that can capture complex gene co-expression patterns and
          unravel higher-order functional genomics insights, which in turn could
          reveal novel therapeutic targets and facilitate clustering of complex
          traits for precision medicine applications.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the
          format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;

          Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues has
          enabled the development of novel approaches to identify biological
          processes associated with diseases. 


          Content: A prominent method among these is the transcription-wide
          association study (TWAS) approach, which amalgamates expression
          quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic
          interpretation for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) findings

          functions by examining whether perturbations in gene regulatory
          mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human
          diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This
          approach has achieved remarkable success in understanding disease
          etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] and has also been

          level. The present manuscript aims to address this knowledge gap by
          projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns,

          @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. A
          promising approach to achieve this is through the use of
          transcription-wide association studies (TWAS), which integrates
          expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a
          mechanistic interpretation for genome-wide association study (GWAS)
          findings. TWAS functions by testing whether perturbations in gene
          regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants
          and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;

          @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This method has been highly successful in
          understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level
          [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433], as

          [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing tasks
          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. However, TWAS operates at the individual gene
          level, thereby overlooking more complex interactions at the network
          level.

          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9] has paved the way for identifying
          biological processes implicated in human diseases.


          Content: A prominent approach, transcription-wide association studies
          (TWAS), combines expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data with
          genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to elucidate the mechanistic
          interpretation of GWAS findings [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;
          @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889;
          @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. TWAS examines the role of gene regulatory
          mechanisms in mediating the relationship between genetic variants and
          diseases, with successful applications in understanding disease
          etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433], disease-risk
          prediction (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w], and
          drug repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].


          Conclusion: Despite the success of TWAS in identifying individual gene
          associations with diseases, this method does not account for more
          intricate network interactions at the system level. Consequently,
          there is a need to develop and apply methods that can capture these
          complexities to further enhance our understanding of disease etiology
          and therapeutic targets through functional genomics approaches,
          including gene co-expression and clustering of complex traits.

          The increasing accessibility of gene expression data across various
          tissues presents an opportunity to identify biological processes
          effectively [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;

          promising approach to achieve this is the transcription-wide
          association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative
          trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation of
          GWAS findings. TWAS functions by testing whether perturbations in gene
          regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants
          and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;

          several applications, including understanding disease etiology at the
          transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;

          level, thereby overlooking more intricate interactions at the network
          level.

          Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues has
          paved the way for novel approaches to identify biological processes
          underlying human diseases. 


          Content: A prominent method in this regard is the transcription-wide
          association study (TWAS) [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;

          studies (GWAS) to offer a mechanistic understanding of GWAS findings.
          It operates by testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory

          In summary, while TWAS has proven to be a successful tool in
          identifying disease-associated genetic variants and interpreting GWAS
          findings, its focus on individual genes means that more intricate
          interactions at the network level remain unexplored. Addressing this

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section.

          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.
          However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not
          capture more complex interactions at the network level.

          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], TWAS offers a valuable tool for
          identifying disease-associated biological processes by integrating

          In summary, while TWAS has proven to be a powerful method for
          identifying disease-associated genetic variants and their downstream
          effects on gene expression, its reliance on individual gene analysis
          may limit its ability to capture complex interactions at the network
          level. This knowledge gap highlights the need for further research
          into more sophisticated analytical methods that can account for such
          interactions, thereby enhancing our understanding of the genetic basis
          of human diseases.

          an effective method to identify these biological processes is the

          However, TWAS operates at the individual gene level, which may
          overlook more intricate interactions at the network level.


          In this manuscript, we aim to address this knowledge gap by proposing
          a novel approach that projects genetic associations through gene
          expression patterns, highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms
          at the network level. This method leverages the power of TWAS and
          eQTLs data while incorporating gene co-expression networks, enabling
          the identification of complex interactions among genes implicated in
          diseases and drug responses. By clustering complex traits and
          analyzing their genetic underpinnings within these networks, we can
          uncover novel therapeutic targets and facilitate drug repurposing
          efforts.

          Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) are a class of genetic

          Addressing this knowledge gap, the present study proposes a novel

          patterns, thereby highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms at

          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.

          a novel approach that projects genetic associations through gene
          expression patterns, highlighting disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms. By considering the complex interplay of genes within
          networks, our method aims to provide a more comprehensive
          understanding of the relationship between genetic variants and human
          diseases, ultimately contributing to the advancement of functional
          genomics research and therapeutic target identification for drug
          repurposing.

          Content: A prominent approach among these is the transcription-wide
          association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative
          trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic understanding of GWAS
          findings at the individual gene level. TWAS has been instrumental in
          elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome level
          [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] and
          has proven beneficial for disease-risk prediction, as demonstrated by
          polygenic scores [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w], as well as drug
          repurposing tasks [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. However, TWAS focuses on
          individual gene-level analysis and does not account for more intricate
          interactions at the network level.


          Conclusion: Bridging this knowledge gap, our manuscript introduces a
          novel method that projects genetic associations through gene
          expression patterns, capturing complex interactions at the network
          level. By clustering complex traits [@pmid:33931583;

          only enhances the understanding of disease etiology but also provides
          valuable insights for identifying therapeutic targets and drug
          repurposing opportunities.

          Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues has
          paved the way for novel analytical methods to identify biological
          processes associated with genetic variants. 


          Content: A prominent approach, transcription-wide association studies
          (TWAS), integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to
          offer a mechanistic understanding of GWAS findings by testing
          perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms at the individual gene
          level [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;
          @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. This
          method has proven successful in explaining disease etiology at the
          transcriptome level and has contributed to disease-risk prediction
          (polygenic scores) and drug repurposing [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433;
          @doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w; @doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. However, TWAS
          primarily focuses on individual gene-level interactions and may
          overlook more complex network-level relationships.


          Conclusion: Bridging this knowledge gap requires the development of
          methods that capture intricate interactions at the network level while
          maintaining the ability to provide a mechanistic interpretation for
          GWAS findings, thereby enhancing our understanding of disease etiology
          and facilitating advancements in disease-risk prediction and drug
          repurposing.

          Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues has
          paved the way for identifying biological processes implicated in
          disease etiology. A popular method to achieve this is through
          transcription-wide association studies (TWAS), which integrates
          expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic
          understanding of GWAS findings.


          Content: TWAS functions at the individual gene level, thereby
          overlooking more intricate interactions at the network level. This
          approach tests whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms
          mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases,
          with noteworthy achievements in comprehending disease etiology at the
          transcriptome level. Moreover, TWAS has contributed to disease-risk
          prediction (polygenic scores) and drug repurposing tasks. However, its
          reliance on individual gene-based analysis may overlook essential
          information embedded in gene co-expression patterns.


          Conclusion: Bridging this knowledge gap, our study introduces a novel
          approach that projects genetic associations through gene expression
          patterns, thereby highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms at
          the network level. By clustering complex traits and considering gene
          co-expression, we aim to reveal previously undetected therapeutic
          targets and facilitate drug repurposing efforts.

          Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues has

          processes associated with genetic variants. 


          Content: A prominent approach is the transcription-wide association
          study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci
          (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic understanding of GWAS findings at
          the individual gene level [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. TWAS examines the role of
          perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms as mediators between
          genetic variants and human diseases
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This method
          has been successful in elucidating disease etiology at the
          transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;

          (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug
          repurposing tasks [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].


          Conclusion: Despite TWAS's success in capturing gene-level
          interactions, there remains a need to address more complex
          network-level interactions that may contribute to our understanding of
          the genetic architecture underlying human diseases. This manuscript
          aims to address this knowledge gap by proposing and validating an
          extension to the existing TWAS framework.

          Content: A popular approach to leverage this resource is the
          transcription-wide association study (TWAS)
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], which
          integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide

          Conclusion: Bridging this knowledge gap, our study introduces a novel
          approach that projects genetic associations through gene expression
          patterns to highlight disease etiology and drug mechanisms, focusing
          on the clustering of complex traits within gene co-expression

          facilitating drug repurposing efforts in a more integrated manner.

          Content: A prominent method, transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to
          offer a mechanistic understanding of GWAS findings by testing whether
          perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association
          between genetic variants and diseases [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;

          @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. TWAS has been successful in understanding
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level and has contributed to
          disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) and drug repurposing tasks
          [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433;

          primarily operates at the individual gene level, overlooking more
          complex interactions at the network level.


          Conclusion: Despite its accomplishments, there is a need to extend
          TWAS methodologies to capture intricate interactions at the network
          level, thereby providing a more comprehensive understanding of
          disease-associated biological processes and human diseases' genetic
          underpinnings.

          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)

          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific

          Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues has
          paved the way for novel approaches to identify biological processes
          underlying human diseases. 


          Content: One such method, the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to
          offer a mechanistic interpretation of GWAS findings by testing whether
          perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association
          between genetic variants and diseases [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;
          @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889;
          @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. TWAS has been instrumental in understanding
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level and has made significant
          contributions to disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)
          [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing tasks
          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. However, TWAS operates at the individual gene
          level, which may overlook more intricate interactions at the network
          level.


          Conclusion: Bridging this knowledge gap requires addressing complex
          interactions among genes and their regulatory mechanisms, which could
          offer a more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and
          improved risk prediction, drug repurposing, or therapeutic strategies.

          Context: The advent of gene expression data across numerous tissues
          has paved the way for novel methods to identify biological processes
          associated with human diseases. 


          Content: A prominent approach, transcription-wide association studies
          (TWAS), amalgamates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data
          with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) findings to offer a
          mechanistic interpretation at the individual gene level
          [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;
          @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. This
          method has achieved remarkable success in understanding disease
          etiology at the transcriptome level, predicting disease risk through
          polygenic scores [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w], and repurposing
          drugs [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. However, TWAS primarily focuses on
          individual gene-level associations, neglecting more intricate
          interactions at the network level.


          Conclusion: This manuscript aims to address the knowledge gap by
          proposing a method that projects genetic associations onto gene
          expression patterns, thereby highlighting disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms through the clustering of complex traits [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]. By considering gene
          co-expression and network-level interactions, the proposed approach
          intends to enhance our understanding of genetic associations with
          human diseases and contribute to therapeutic target identification as
          well as drug repurposing efforts.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the
          format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;

          Input paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across
          several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify
          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.
          However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not
          capture more complex interactions at the network level. TWAS relies on
          testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate
          the association between genetic variants and human diseases
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;

          approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;

          disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)
          [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing

          Content: A prominent approach is the transcription-wide association
          study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci

          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. TWAS has been successful in
          understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level and has
          contributed to disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)

          analysis, which may overlook more intricate interactions at the
          network level.


          Conclusion: Despite its success, there is a need to expand the
          analytical scope of TWAS beyond the individual gene level to encompass
          complex interactions at the network level

          this knowledge gap will provide a more comprehensive understanding of

              In the complex world of genetics, genes do not operate in
              isolation but rather collaborate within context-specific networks
              to carry out various cellular functions [@pmid:19104045;
              @doi:10.1038/ng.3259]. Minor alterations in these genes can
              significantly impact their functional roles, ultimately affecting
              disease-relevant biological processes
              [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6]. A deeper understanding of the
              mechanisms underlying gene expression regulation across different
              cell types is therefore essential for elucidating how genes
              influence complex traits, which could potentially lead to improved
              treatments [@doi:10.1038/ng.3314;
              @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008489].


              Previous studies have identified various regulatory DNA elements,
              including genetic effects on gene expression across different

              In the complex world of genetics, genes do not function
              independently but rather collaborate in context-specific networks
              to carry out various cellular functions [@pmid:19104045;
              @doi:10.1038/ng.3259]. Minor alterations in these genetic
              sequences can significantly impact their functional roles,
              ultimately influencing disease-relevant biological processes
              [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6]. A crucial aspect of
              understanding how genes contribute to complex traits lies in
              mechanistically elucidating gene expression regulation across
              different cell types [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
              @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3; @doi:10.1038/s41576-019-0200-9].
              Indeed, such knowledge has the potential to enhance treatment
              options [@doi:10.1038/ng.3314; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008489].


              Previous studies have identified various regulatory DNA elements,
              including genetic effects on gene expression across diverse
              tissues [@doi:10.1038/nature11247; @doi:10.1038/nature14248;
              @doi:10.1038/nature12787; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-03145-z;
              @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3]. Integrating functional genomics
              data and GWAS data has facilitated the identification of
              transcriptional mechanisms, which, when dysregulated, frequently
              result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology

              biological functions. 


              Content: Previous studies have reported different regulatory DNA
              elements and genetic effects on gene expression across various

              Integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data has improved
              the identification of transcriptional mechanisms that, when
              dysregulated, commonly result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific

              Conclusion: Despite these advances, there is still a need to
              better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying gene
              expression regulation in specific cell types and how they
              contribute to complex traits and diseases. This knowledge gap
              underscores the importance of the current study, which aims to
              elucidate the role of genetic variation in shaping gene expression
              regulation across different cell types and its implications for
              disease pathogenesis.

              In the complex world of genetics, genes do not function in
              isolation but rather collaborate within context-specific networks
              to execute various cellular activities [@pmid:19104045;
              @doi:10.1038/ng.3259]. Alterations in these genetic elements can

              biological processes [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6]. A crucial
              aspect of understanding how genes influence complex traits lies in

              a mechanistic grasp of gene expression regulation across different
              cell types.


              Content: Previous studies have identified various regulatory DNA
              elements and genetic effects on gene expression across tissues
              [@doi:10.1038/nature11247; @doi:10.1038/nature14248;

              Integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data has enhanced
              the identification of transcriptional mechanisms, which, when
              dysregulated, often lead to tissue- and cell lineage-specific

              Context: Genes function in a complex network, interacting with
              each other to carry out various cellular processes. Variations in
              these genes can have significant consequences on disease-relevant
              biological functions. 


              Content: Previous studies have identified different regulatory DNA
              elements and genetic effects on gene expression across diverse
              tissues [@doi:10.1038/nature11247; @doi:10.1038/nature14248;

              @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776].
              Integration of functional genomics data and GWAS data has improved
              the identification of transcriptional mechanisms, which, when
              dysregulated, often lead to tissue-specific pathology
              [@doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0081-4; @doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.04.002;

              Understanding how genes influence complex traits requires a
              mechanistic grasp of gene expression regulation across different
              cell types [@doi:10.1038/ng.3259; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;

              Conclusion: Despite these advances, a critical knowledge gap
              remains in determining how genes influence complex traits through
              gene expression regulation across different cell types. Addressing
              this question will provide valuable insights necessary for
              improving treatments and understanding the molecular mechanisms
              underlying tissue-specific pathology.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining
              the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the
              following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance
              clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The
              revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a
              Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure
              begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context),
              progresses through what is known from the literature (Content),
              and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap the
              manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1)
              preserve the original information as much as possible, with
              minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to
              scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the
              original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
              and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as
              "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;
              @pmid:31036433]", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate
              the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a
              single, cohesive paragraph.

              Context: Genes function in a complex network, interacting with
              each other to carry out various biological processes. These
              genetic interactions can be influenced by variations in the genes
              themselves, which may subsequently affect disease-relevant
              activities. Understanding how genes contribute to these processes,
              particularly in the context of complex traits, is essential for
              improving treatments and diagnostics.


              Content: Previous studies have identified different regulatory DNA
              elements that play a role in gene expression across various
              tissues [@doi:10.1038/nature11247; @doi:10.1038/nature14248;
              @doi:10.1038/nature12787; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-03145-z;
              @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776].
              Integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data has enhanced
              the identification of transcriptional mechanisms, which, when
              dysregulated, commonly result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific
              pathology [@doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0081-4;
              @doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.04.002; @doi:10.1038/ncomms6890].
              Mechanistic understanding of gene expression regulation across
              different cell types is crucial for determining how genes
              influence complex traits [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
              @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3; @doi:10.1038/s41576-019-0200-9].


              Conclusion: Despite these advances, there remains a need to
              elucidate the specific mechanisms by which genetic variations
              affect gene expression regulation and downstream disease-relevant
              processes in complex traits. This manuscript aims to address this
              knowledge gap by providing novel insights into the relationship
              between genetic variations, gene expression regulation, and their
              impact on complex traits, ultimately paving the way for improved
              diagnostics and treatments.

              The increasing accessibility of gene expression data across
              various tissues provides a valuable resource for exploring
              biological processes [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;

              transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) have emerged as an
              effective approach for identifying these processes. TWAS
              integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to
              offer a mechanistic interpretation of GWAS findings by testing
              whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the

              [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing tasks
              [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. Nevertheless, TWAS primarily operates at
              the individual gene level, which may overlook more intricate

              TWAS functions by testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory
              mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and
              human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;

              [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]

              tasks [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].


              Conclusion: Despite the success of TWAS at the individual gene
              level, there remains a need to explore more complex interactions
              at the network level, as current approaches may not fully capture
              these intricate relationships. Bridging this knowledge gap is
              essential for further advancements in genetic studies and
              functional genomics, particularly in relation to gene
              co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, and the
              clustering of complex traits.

              Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues
              has paved the way for novel analytical methods to identify
              biological processes underlying human diseases. 


              Content: A prominent approach among these is the
              Transcription-Wide Association Study (TWAS), which amalgamates
              expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTLs) data to offer a
              mechanistic interpretation of Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS)
              findings by testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory
              mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and
              diseases. TWAS has proven successful not only in elucidating
              disease etiology at the transcriptome level but also in predicting
              disease risk via polygenic scores and facilitating drug
              repurposing tasks. However, TWAS operates primarily at the
              individual gene level, thereby overlooking more intricate
              interactions at the network level.


              Conclusion: Despite its accomplishments, TWAS's focus on
              individual genes leaves a knowledge gap concerning complex
              interactions at the network level. The current manuscript aims to
              address this gap by presenting an innovative method that captures
              these interactions and improves our understanding of disease
              etiology.

              Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues
              has paved the way for novel approaches to identify biological
              processes underlying human diseases. 


              Content: A prominent method in this domain is the
              transcription-wide association study (TWAS)
              (@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;
              @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9). By
              integrating expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data, TWAS
              offers a mechanistic interpretation for genome-wide association
              study (GWAS) findings, testing whether gene regulatory mechanism
              perturbations mediate the link between genetic variants and
              diseases (@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
              @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367). Such
              approaches have significantly advanced our understanding of
              disease etiology at the transcriptome level and contributed to
              disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)
              (@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w) and drug repurposing tasks
              (@doi:10.1038/nn.4618).


              Conclusion: Despite these successes, TWAS focuses on individual
              gene level associations, thereby overlooking more intricate
              interactions at the network level. This knowledge gap necessitates
              the exploration of methods that can capture complex gene
              co-expression patterns and unravel higher-order functional
              genomics insights, which in turn could reveal novel therapeutic
              targets and facilitate clustering of complex traits for precision
              medicine applications.

              has enabled the development of novel approaches to identify
              biological processes associated with diseases. 


              Content: A prominent method among these is the transcription-wide
              association study (TWAS) approach, which amalgamates expression
              quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic
              interpretation for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) findings
              [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;

              TWAS functions by examining whether perturbations in gene
              regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic
              variants and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;

              @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This approach has achieved remarkable
              success in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome
              level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;

              and drug repurposing tasks [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].


              Conclusion: Despite TWAS's success at the individual gene level,
              this approach does not capture more intricate interactions at the
              network level. The present manuscript aims to address this
              knowledge gap by projecting genetic associations through gene
              expression patterns, thereby highlighting disease etiology and

              biological processes implicated in human diseases.


              Content: A prominent approach, transcription-wide association
              studies (TWAS), combines expression quantitative trait loci
              (eQTLs) data with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to
              elucidate the mechanistic interpretation of GWAS findings
              [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;

              examines the role of gene regulatory mechanisms in mediating the
              relationship between genetic variants and diseases, with
              successful applications in understanding disease etiology at the
              transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;

              Conclusion: Despite the success of TWAS in identifying individual
              gene associations with diseases, this method does not account for
              more intricate network interactions at the system level.
              Consequently, there is a need to develop and apply methods that
              can capture these complexities to further enhance our
              understanding of disease etiology and therapeutic targets through
              functional genomics approaches, including gene co-expression and
              clustering of complex traits.

              transcription-wide association study (TWAS)
              [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;
              @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9].
              TWAS amalgamates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data
              with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to offer a mechanistic
              understanding of GWAS findings. It operates by testing whether
              perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the
              association between genetic variants and human diseases
              [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
              @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This
              approach has not only enhanced our comprehension of disease
              etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also proven
              beneficial in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)
              [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing
              [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].


              Conclusion: Despite these advances, TWAS focuses on individual
              gene level analyses, thereby overlooking more intricate
              interactions at the network level. This knowledge gap necessitates
              the development of methods that can capture complex gene-gene and
              gene-environment interactions, which could potentially uncover
              novel insights into disease etiology and therapeutic targets.

              expression patterns to better understand disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms (closing the knowledge gap related to the clustering of

              Transcription-wide Association Studies (TWAS) are a class of
              methods that aim to understand the relationship between genetic
              variants and human diseases by examining perturbations in gene
              regulatory mechanisms [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;
              @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889;
              @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. These approaches have been successful in
              several areas, including elucidating disease etiology at the
              transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433], predicting
              disease risk through polygenic scores
              [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w], and repurposing drugs
              [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. With the abundance of gene expression data
              across various tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
              @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
              @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], TWAS offers a valuable approach
              to identify disease-associated biological processes by integrating
              expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data. This method
              provides a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings at the
              individual gene level. However, one limitation of TWAS is that it
              does not capture more complex interactions at the network level.


              In summary, while TWAS has proven to be a successful tool in
              identifying disease-associated genetic variants and interpreting
              GWAS findings, its focus on individual genes means that more
              intricate interactions at the network level remain unexplored.
              Addressing this knowledge gap is crucial for gaining a deeper
              understanding of the relationship between gene regulatory
              mechanisms and human diseases.

              Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) are genetic methods
              that examine whether alterations in gene regulatory mechanisms
              mediate the relationship between genetic variants and human
              diseases ([@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;

              processes. This method integrates expression quantitative trait
              loci (eQTLs) data, offering a mechanistic explanation for
              genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings. However, TWAS
              operates at an individual gene level, overlooking more intricate
              interactions at the network level. Thus, this manuscript aims to

              Transcription-wide Association Studies (TWAS) are a class of
              analytical methods that aim to understand the relationship between
              genetic variants and human diseases by examining perturbations in
              gene regulatory mechanisms [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;
              @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889;
              @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. These approaches have been successful in
              several areas, including elucidating disease etiology at the
              transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433], disease-risk
              prediction through polygenic scores
              [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w], and drug repurposing
              [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. With the abundance of gene expression data
              across various tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
              @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
              @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], TWAS offers a valuable tool for
              identifying disease-associated biological processes by integrating
              expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a
              mechanistic interpretation of GWAS findings. Nevertheless, TWAS
              operates at the individual gene level, which may overlook more
              intricate interactions at the network level.


              In summary, while TWAS has proven to be a powerful method for
              identifying disease-associated genetic variants and their
              downstream effects on gene expression, its reliance on individual
              gene analysis may limit its ability to capture complex
              interactions at the network level. This knowledge gap highlights
              the need for further research into more sophisticated analytical
              methods that can account for such interactions, thereby enhancing
              our understanding of the genetic basis of human diseases.

              In this manuscript, we aim to address this knowledge gap by
              proposing a novel approach that projects genetic associations
              through gene expression patterns, highlighting disease etiology
              and drug mechanisms at the network level. This method leverages
              the power of TWAS and eQTLs data while incorporating gene
              co-expression networks, enabling the identification of complex
              interactions among genes implicated in diseases and drug
              responses. By clustering complex traits and analyzing their
              genetic underpinnings within these networks, we can uncover novel
              therapeutic targets and facilitate drug repurposing efforts.

              mechanistic interpretation for genome-wide association studies

              Transcription-wide Association Studies (TWAS) are a class of
              methods that test whether perturbations in gene regulatory
              mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and

              and have applications in disease-risk prediction (polygenic
              scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing
              [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. TWAS integrates expression quantitative
              trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation
              for Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) findings, leveraging
              the availability of gene expression data across several tissues

              However, a limitation of TWAS is that it operates at the
              individual gene level, thereby missing more complex interactions
              at the network level. This knowledge gap underscores the need for
              methods that can identify and characterize these higher-order
              interactions in the context of TWAS.

              In this manuscript, we aim to address this knowledge gap by
              proposing a novel approach that projects genetic associations

              understanding of the relationship between genetic variants and
              human diseases, ultimately contributing to the advancement of
              functional genomics research and therapeutic target identification

              Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues

              Content: A prominent approach among these is the
              transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates
              expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a
              mechanistic understanding of GWAS findings at the individual gene

              at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] and has proven

              Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues
              has paved the way for novel analytical methods to identify
              biological processes associated with genetic variants. 


              Content: A prominent approach, transcription-wide association
              studies (TWAS), integrates expression quantitative trait loci
              (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic understanding of GWAS findings
              by testing perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms at the
              individual gene level [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
              @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
              @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. This method has proven
              successful in explaining disease etiology at the transcriptome
              level and has contributed to disease-risk prediction (polygenic
              scores) and drug repurposing [@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433;
              @doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w; @doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. However,
              TWAS primarily focuses on individual gene-level interactions and
              may overlook more complex network-level relationships.


              Conclusion: Bridging this knowledge gap requires the development
              of methods that capture intricate interactions at the network
              level while maintaining the ability to provide a mechanistic
              interpretation for GWAS findings, thereby enhancing our
              understanding of disease etiology and facilitating advancements in
              disease-risk prediction and drug repurposing.

              has paved the way for identifying biological processes implicated
              in disease etiology. A popular method to achieve this is through

              Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues
              has facilitated the development of novel methods to identify
              biological processes associated with genetic variants. 


              Content: A prominent approach is the transcription-wide
              association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative
              trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic understanding of
              GWAS findings at the individual gene level [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
              @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
              @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. TWAS examines the role of
              perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms as mediators between
              genetic variants and human diseases
              [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
              @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This
              method has been successful in elucidating disease etiology at the
              transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] and has
              contributed to disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)
              [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing tasks
              [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].


              Conclusion: Despite TWAS's success in capturing gene-level
              interactions, there remains a need to address more complex
              network-level interactions that may contribute to our
              understanding of the genetic architecture underlying human
              diseases. This manuscript aims to address this knowledge gap by
              proposing and validating an extension to the existing TWAS
              framework.

              method has been successful not only in understanding disease
              etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;

              individual gene level analysis, thereby overlooking more intricate
              interactions at the network level.


              Conclusion: Bridging this knowledge gap, our study introduces a
              novel approach that projects genetic associations through gene
              expression patterns to highlight disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms, focusing on the clustering of complex traits within
              gene co-expression networks. This strategy goes beyond TWAS
              limitations by incorporating network-level insights, thereby
              refining therapeutic targets and facilitating drug repurposing

              Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues
              has paved the way for novel approaches to identify biological
              processes associated with human diseases. 


              Content: A prominent method, transcription-wide association study
              (TWAS), integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data
              to offer a mechanistic understanding of GWAS findings by testing
              whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the
              association between genetic variants and diseases
              [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;
              @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9;

              @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. TWAS has
              been successful in understanding disease etiology at the
              transcriptome level and has contributed to disease-risk prediction
              (polygenic scores) and drug repurposing tasks [@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433;
              @doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w; @doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. However,
              TWAS primarily operates at the individual gene level, overlooking
              more complex interactions at the network level.


              Conclusion: Despite its accomplishments, there is a need to extend
              TWAS methodologies to capture intricate interactions at the
              network level, thereby providing a more comprehensive
              understanding of disease-associated biological processes and human
              diseases' genetic underpinnings.

              Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues
              has paved the way for novel approaches to identify biological
              processes underlying human diseases. 


              Content: One such method, the transcription-wide association study
              (TWAS), integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data
              to offer a mechanistic interpretation of GWAS findings by testing
              whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the
              association between genetic variants and diseases
              [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;

              @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. TWAS has
              been instrumental in understanding disease etiology at the
              transcriptome level and has made significant contributions to
              disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)
              [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing tasks
              [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. However, TWAS operates at the individual
              gene level, which may overlook more intricate interactions at the
              network level.


              Conclusion: Bridging this knowledge gap requires addressing
              complex interactions among genes and their regulatory mechanisms,
              which could offer a more comprehensive understanding of disease
              etiology and improved risk prediction, drug repurposing, or
              therapeutic strategies.

              for GWAS findings. However, TWAS works at the individual gene
              level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the
              network level. TWAS relies on testing whether perturbations in
              gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic
              variants and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;

              Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues
              has enabled the development of novel methods for identifying
              biological processes associated with genetic variants. 


              Content: A prominent approach is the transcription-wide
              association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative
              trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic interpretation of
              GWAS findings at the individual gene level [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
              @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
              @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. TWAS has been successful in
              understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level and has
              contributed to disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)
              [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing tasks
              [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. However, TWAS focuses on individual
              gene-level analysis, which may overlook more intricate
              interactions at the network level.


              Conclusion: Despite its success, there is a need to expand the
              analytical scope of TWAS beyond the individual gene level to
              encompass complex interactions at the network level
              [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
              @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367].
              Addressing this knowledge gap will provide a more comprehensive
              understanding of the relationship between genetic variants and
              human diseases at the transcriptome level.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining
              the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the
              following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance
              clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The
              revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a
              Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure
              begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context),
              progresses through what is known from the literature (Content),
              and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap the
              manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1)
              preserve the original information as much as possible, with
              minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to
              scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the
              original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
              and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as
              "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;
              @pmid:31036433]", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate
              the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a
              single, cohesive paragraph.
