          adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion
          (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one
          or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the

          Context: Genes operate within context-specific networks to carry out
          various cellular functions, and changes in these genes can impact
          disease-relevant biological processes. Understanding how genes
          influence complex traits requires a mechanistic grasp of gene
          expression regulation across different cell types.


          Content: Previous studies have identified different regulatory DNA
          elements and genetic effects on gene expression across tissues.
          Integrating functional genomics data with GWAS data has improved the
          identification of transcriptional mechanisms, which, when
          dysregulated, often result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific
          pathology. For instance, genetic variants can alter the functional
          role of genes, thereby affecting disease-relevant biological processes
          [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;

          @doi:10.1038/ncomms6890].


          Conclusion: Despite these findings, a knowledge gap remains in
          understanding how gene expression regulation varies across different
          cell types and how this variation influences complex traits and
          disease susceptibility. The current manuscript aims to address this
          gap by investigating the role of context-specific gene networks and
          their impact on disease-relevant biological processes.

          In the complex world of genetics, genes do not function in isolation
          but rather collaborate within context-specific networks to execute
          various cellular functions [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259].
          Minor alterations in these genetic sequences can significantly impact
          their functional roles, ultimately influencing disease-relevant
          biological processes [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6]. A critical
          aspect of understanding how genes contribute to complex traits lies in
          elucidating the mechanisms of gene expression regulation across
          diverse cell types [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
          @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3; @doi:10.1038/s41576-019-0200-9]. This
          knowledge has the potential to enhance treatment options
          [@doi:10.1038/ng.3314; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008489].


          Previous research has identified different regulatory DNA elements,
          including genetic effects on gene expression across various tissues
          [@doi:10.1038/nature11247; @doi:10.1038/nature14248;
          @doi:10.1038/nature12787; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-03145-z;
          @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3]. Furthermore, integrating functional
          genomics data and GWAS (genome-wide association studies) data
          [@doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0081-4; @doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.04.002;

          significantly improved the detection of transcriptional mechanisms.
          Disruptions in these mechanisms often lead to tissue- and cell
          lineage-specific pathology [@pmid:20624743; @pmid:14707169;
          @doi:10.1073/pnas.0810772105]. However, there is a need for further
          research examining how gene co-expression patterns can highlight
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms, which this manuscript aims to
          address.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the
          format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;

          through gene expression patterns, thereby highlighting disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms, as well as identifying therapeutic
          targets and exploring drug repurposing opportunities. Additionally,
          the study will employ clustering of complex traits to enhance our
          grasp of the intricate relationship between genetics and disease.

          targets and explore opportunities for drug repurposing.

          Context: Genes function in a complex network, and variations within
          these genes can have significant consequences on disease-relevant
          biological processes. Understanding how genes influence such traits
          necessitates a mechanistic grasp of gene expression regulation across
          diverse cell types. While previous studies have shed light on various
          regulatory DNA elements and the genetic effects on gene expression
          across tissues, there remains a need to identify transcriptional
          mechanisms that, when dysregulated, commonly result in tissue- and
          cell lineage-specific pathology.


          Content: Genes operate in context-specific networks to carry out
          different functions [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259]. Variations

          transcriptional mechanisms.


          Conclusion: Despite progress in identifying regulatory DNA elements
          and genetic effects on gene expression across tissues, there is still
          a need to enhance our understanding of the transcriptional mechanisms
          that, when dysregulated, commonly result in tissue- and cell
          lineage-specific pathology [@pmid:20624743; @pmid:14707169;
          @doi:10.1073/pnas.0810772105]. This manuscript aims to address this
          knowledge gap by presenting novel findings on the integration of
          functional genomics data and GWAS data, thereby improving our ability
          to identify transcriptional mechanisms underlying complex traits.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section.


          Input paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across
          several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;

          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS
          relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms
          mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;

          disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;

          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks. However, TWAS works at the individual
          gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the
          network level.

          The increasing abundance of gene expression data across diverse
          tissues offers a valuable resource for exploring biological processes
          [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;
          @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. A
          powerful approach to dissect these processes is the transcription-wide
          association study (TWAS), which amalgamates expression quantitative
          trait loci (eQTLs) data to elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings of
          GWAS findings. TWAS functions by examining whether alterations in gene
          regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between genetic variants and
          human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;
          @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889;
          @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This methodology has achieved remarkable
          success in unraveling disease etiology at the transcriptome level
          [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] and
          has also proven beneficial in disease-risk prediction (polygenic
          scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing tasks
          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. Nevertheless, TWAS operates at the individual
          gene level, thereby overlooking more intricate interactions at the
          network level.

          following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should
          adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion

          or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these

          Content: One such method, the transcription-wide association study

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the
          format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]", and 4) the revised
          paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C
          structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.


          Input paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across
          several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify
          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS
          relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms
          mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these
          approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in
          disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)
          [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing
          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks. However, TWAS works at the individual
          gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the
          network level.

          Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues has
          enabled the development of computational methods to identify
          biological processes associated with these data.


          Content: A notable approach is the transcription-wide association
          study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci
          (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic interpretation for genome-wide
          association studies (GWAS) findings [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. TWAS functions by testing whether
          perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association
          between genetic variants and human diseases
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This method
          has been successful in understanding disease etiology at the
          transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;
          @pmid:31036433] and has contributed to disease-risk prediction
          (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug
          repurposing tasks [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].


          Conclusion: Despite TWAS's success at the individual gene level, it
          does not capture more complex interactions at the network level,
          highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap that this manuscript aims
          to address.

          With the increasing abundance of gene expression data across various

          @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9), a
          powerful approach to discern biological processes is the
          transcription-wide association study (TWAS). This method amalgamates
          expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to furnish a
          mechanistic understanding of GWAS findings. TWAS operates by examining
          whether disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link
          between genetic variants and human diseases
          ([@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482]; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;

          ([@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]). Nevertheless, TWAS functions at the
          individual gene level, thereby overlooking more intricate interactions
          at the network level.

          adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion
          (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one
          or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the
          format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]", and 4) the revised
          paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C
          structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.


          Input paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across
          several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify
          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS
          relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms
          mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these
          approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in
          disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)
          [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing
          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks. However, TWAS works at the individual
          gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the
          network level.

          Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues has
          paved the way for novel approaches to identify biological processes
          underlying human diseases. 


          Content: A prominent method in this regard is the transcription-wide
          association study (TWAS) (@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9). By integrating expression
          quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data, TWAS offers a mechanistic
          interpretation for genetic associations uncovered by genome-wide
          association studies (GWAS). This approach tests whether alterations in
          gene regulatory mechanisms serve as mediators between genetic variants
          and diseases (@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367). Such efforts
          have significantly advanced our understanding of disease etiology at
          the transcriptome level and contributed to disease-risk prediction
          (polygenic scores) (@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w) and drug
          repurposing tasks (@doi:10.1038/nn.4618).


          Conclusion: Despite TWAS's success at the individual gene level, there
          remains a need to explore more complex interactions at the network
          level, which may further elucidate disease etiology and reveal novel
          therapeutic targets and strategies for drug repurposing. The current
          manuscript aims to address this knowledge gap by employing a
          clustering of complex traits strategy within the functional genomics
          framework, focusing on gene co-expression patterns and their
          implications for genetic associations.

          The increasing accessibility of gene expression data across various

          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. TWAS focuses
          on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate
          the association between genetic variants and human diseases, thereby
          significantly contributing to understanding disease etiology at the

          prediction (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and
          drug repurposing tasks [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. Nevertheless, TWAS

          Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues has
          paved the way for novel approaches to identify biological processes
          underlying human diseases. 


          Content: A prominent method in this regard is the transcription-wide
          association study (TWAS) (@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9). By integrating expression
          quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data, TWAS offers a mechanistic
          interpretation for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) findings,
          testing whether gene regulatory mechanism perturbations mediate the
          relationship between genetic variants and diseases
          (@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367). Such
          approaches have proven successful in understanding disease etiology at
          the transcriptome level (@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433), predicting disease
          risk with polygenic scores (@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w), and
          repurposing drugs (@doi:10.1038/nn.4618).


          Conclusion: Despite TWAS's individual gene level focus, there remains
          a need to explore more complex interactions at the network level,
          specifically through the lens of genetic studies, functional genomics,
          and gene co-expression. This knowledge gap warrants further
          investigation into the clustering of complex traits and identification
          of therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.

          Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues has
          paved the way for novel approaches to identify biological processes
          underlying human diseases. 


          Content: A prominent method in this regard is the transcription-wide
          association study (TWAS), which combines expression quantitative trait
          loci (eQTLs) data with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to
          elucidate the mechanistic interpretation of GWAS findings. TWAS
          functions by testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory
          mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and
          diseases, thereby contributing significantly to understanding disease
          etiology at the transcriptome level. Moreover, TWAS has proven
          beneficial in predicting disease risk (polygenic scores) and drug
          repurposing tasks. However, TWAS operates at the individual gene
          level, overlooking more intricate interactions at the network level.


          Conclusion: This knowledge gap highlights the need for further
          research to develop methods that can capture complex network-level
          interactions, providing a more comprehensive understanding of disease
          etiology and potential therapeutic targets.

          Context: The increasing abundance of gene expression data across
          various tissues offers a valuable resource for understanding
          biological processes and their implications in human diseases. 


          Content: A prominent approach to leverage this data is through
          transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. By integrating expression
          quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data, TWAS provides a mechanistic
          interpretation for genetic association findings from genome-wide
          association studies (GWAS). This method tests whether alterations in
          gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the relationship between genetic
          variants and disease risk [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;
          @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889;
          @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. TWAS has proven successful in elucidating
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433], predicting disease
          risk based on polygenic scores [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w], and
          repurposing drugs [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].


          Conclusion: Despite TWAS's success, it primarily focuses on individual
          gene-level associations, overlooking more intricate interactions at

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these

          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS
          relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms

          approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;

          gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the
          network level.

          Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues has
          paved the way for sophisticated bioinformatics analyses to identify
          biological processes underlying human diseases. 


          Content: A notable approach in this regard is the Transcription-Wide
          Association Study (TWAS), which integrates expression Quantitative
          Trait Loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic interpretation of
          Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) findings by testing whether
          perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association
          between genetic variants and diseases [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;

          @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889;
          @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. TWAS has been highly successful in
          understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level,
          contributing to disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)
          [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing tasks
          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].


          Conclusion: Despite these advances, TWAS focuses on individual gene
          analysis, overlooking more intricate interactions at the network
          level. This knowledge gap underscores the need for complementary
          approaches that can elucidate complex disease mechanisms operating at
          the systems biology level.

          Input paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across
          several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;

          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)

          Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues has
          enabled researchers to investigate biological processes in a more
          comprehensive and integrated manner. 


          Content: A notable approach that leverages this wealth of data is the
          transcription-wide association study (TWAS). TWAS integrates
          expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic
          understanding of GWAS findings by testing whether perturbations in
          gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic
          variants and human diseases. This method has achieved significant
          success in elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome level and
          has been instrumental in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)
          and drug repurposing tasks. The scientific literature highlights
          numerous studies that have employed TWAS to great effect, such as
          those referenced here: [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;

          research, as understanding these complex relationships could yield
          even greater insights into disease etiology and potential therapeutic
          interventions.

          Transcription-wide Association Studies (TWAS) are a class of methods
          that test for associations between perturbations in gene regulatory
          mechanisms and the link between genetic variants and human diseases
          (Doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482, Doi: 10.1038/ng.3506, Doi:

          Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) are genetic methods that
          examine whether alterations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the
          relationship between genetic variants and human diseases
          ([@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;

          approaches have significantly contributed to understanding disease
          etiology at the transcriptome level ([@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]) and have been
          successful in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)
          ([@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w]) and drug repurposing tasks

          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]), TWAS offers an effective means to
          identify these biological processes by integrating expression
          quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data, thereby providing a mechanistic
          interpretation for genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings.
          Nevertheless, TWAS operates at the individual gene level, which may
          overlook more intricate interactions at the network level. This
          manuscript addresses this knowledge gap by proposing a novel approach
          that projects genetic associations through gene expression patterns to
          highlight disease etiology and drug mechanisms, thereby capturing
          complex interactions beyond the individual gene level.

          Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) are genetic methods that
          investigate whether alterations in gene regulatory mechanisms underlie
          the association between genetic variants and human diseases
          ([@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;

          approaches have significantly contributed to understanding disease
          etiology at the transcriptome level ([@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]) and have proven
          beneficial in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)
          ([@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w]) and drug repurposing tasks
          ([@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]). The increasing availability of gene
          expression data across various tissues ([@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]) has facilitated the application of
          TWAS, which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data
          to offer a mechanistic understanding of GWAS findings. Nevertheless,
          TWAS operates at the individual gene level, thereby overlooking more
          intricate interactions at the network level.


          In this manuscript, we aim to address this knowledge gap by
          introducing an innovative methodology that projects genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns, highlighting disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms at a systems level. This novel approach
          clusters complex traits ([@pmid:33931583;

          the identification of therapeutic targets and facilitating drug
          repurposing efforts.

          Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) are a class of genetic
          analysis methods that aim to uncover the relationship between
          perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms and the association
          between genetic variants and human diseases
          ([@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]). These
          approaches have been highly successful in several aspects, including
          understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level
          ([@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]),
          disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores
          ([@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w]), and drug repurposing tasks
          ([@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]). This success can be attributed to the
          availability of gene expression data across various tissues
          ([@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;
          @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]).
          Despite the success of TWAS in identifying gene-level associations, it
          does not capture more complex interactions at the network level.


          In this study, we propose to address this knowledge gap by projecting
          genetic associations through gene expression patterns. Specifically,
          we aim to highlight disease etiology and drug mechanisms by
          integrating functional genomics data with TWAS findings. By clustering
          complex traits and identifying co-expressed genes, our approach will
          shed light on the network-level interactions that underlie human
          diseases. In doing so, we hope to uncover novel therapeutic targets
          for drug repurposing and development.

          In summary, while TWAS has proven valuable for identifying
          disease-associated genetic variants and interpreting their mechanisms
          through eQTLs integration, its focus on individual genes may overlook
          complex interactions at higher levels of organization within
          biological systems. Addressing this knowledge gap is crucial for a
          more comprehensive understanding of the intricate relationship between
          genetics, gene regulation, and human diseases.

          Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) are genetic methods that
          investigate whether alterations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate
          the relationship between genetic variants and human diseases

          etiology at the transcriptome level ([@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]) and have been

          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]), TWAS, which integrates expression
          quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data, offers a valuable approach for
          interpreting the functional implications of GWAS findings at an
          individual gene level. However, TWAS does not capture more intricate
          interactions occurring at the network level in these biological
          processes. This manuscript aims to address this knowledge gap by
          highlighting genetic associations through gene expression patterns
          that shed light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms, focusing on
          the clustering of complex traits (Keywords).

          Context: Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) have emerged as
          a powerful tool in the field of functional genomics, elucidating
          disease etiology and informing drug development by examining the
          relationship between genetic variants and gene regulatory mechanisms. 


          Content: TWAS approaches test whether perturbations in gene regulatory
          mechanisms mediate associations between genetic variants and human
          diseases, proving successful in understanding disease etiology at the
          transcriptome level, predicting disease risk through polygenic scores,
          and repurposing drugs [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;
          @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889;
          @doi:10.1038/ng.3367; @pmid:33931583;

          @doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w; @doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. The abundance
          of gene expression data across various tissues has facilitated the use
          of TWAS, which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to offer a mechanistic interpretation for genome-wide association
          study (GWAS) findings [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;

          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9].


          Conclusion: Despite TWAS's success at the individual gene level, there
          remains a need to explore more complex interactions at the network
          level. The present manuscript aims to address this knowledge gap by
          proposing a method that projects genetic associations through gene
          expression patterns, highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms
          while considering intricate network-level interactions.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the
          format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;

          Transcription-wide Association Studies (TWAS) are a class of
          analytical methods that aim to understand the relationship between
          genetic variants and human diseases by examining perturbations in gene
          regulatory mechanisms [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;

          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], TWAS offers a valuable approach to
          identify biological processes by integrating expression quantitative
          trait loci (eQTLs) data, thereby providing a mechanistic
          interpretation for Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) findings.
          However, TWAS operates at the individual gene level, which may
          overlook more intricate interactions occurring at the network level.


          In summary, while TWAS has proven to be a powerful tool in identifying
          perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms associated with human
          diseases, its focus on individual genes means that it may not fully
          capture complex interactions at the network level. This knowledge gap
          underscores the need for further research and methodological
          development in this area.

          Content: A prominent approach in this regard is the transcription-wide
          association study (TWAS), which amalgamates expression quantitative
          trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic understanding of
          genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings by examining individual

          overlook intricate interactions at the network level.


          Conclusion: Bridging this knowledge gap requires a more comprehensive
          examination of genetic associations through gene expression patterns,
          which can highlight disease etiology and drug mechanisms by capturing
          complex interactions among genes in molecular networks. This

          functional genomics but also facilitate the identification of novel
          therapeutic targets and repurposing opportunities for existing drugs,
          thereby contributing to advancements in precision medicine.

          However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not

          Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues has
          paved the way for novel approaches to identify biological processes
          underlying human diseases. 


          Content: A prominent method in this regard is the transcription-wide
          association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative
          trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic interpretation of GWAS
          findings at the individual gene level [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. TWAS has been successful in
          understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level and has
          contributed to disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)
          [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing tasks
          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. However, TWAS focuses on individual gene-level
          analysis and does not account for more intricate interactions at the
          network level.


          Conclusion: Bridging this knowledge gap, our manuscript introduces a
          novel approach that projects genetic associations through gene
          expression patterns, capturing complex interactions at the network
          level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;
          @pmid:31036433]. This advancement in functional genomics allows for a
          more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology, drug mechanisms,
          and therapeutic targets by clustering complex traits within gene
          co-expression networks.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript titled 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' with keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should
          adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion
          (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one
          or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the

          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific

          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9] has paved the way for novel
          analytical methods to identify underlying biological processes. One
          such approach, the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), offers
          a mechanistic interpretation for genome-wide association studies
          (GWAS) findings by integrating expression quantitative trait loci
          (eQTLs) data.


          Content: TWAS functions at the individual gene level, thereby
          overlooking more intricate interactions at the network level. This
          method tests whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms
          mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. Such
          TWAS-based approaches have proven highly successful in several areas,
          including understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level
          [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433],
          disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores

          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].


          Conclusion: Notwithstanding these achievements, TWAS's focus on
          individual gene analysis may limit its ability to fully capture the
          complex interplay of genes within biological networks. This knowledge
          gap underscores the need for complementary methods that can elucidate
          higher-order gene interactions and further reveal disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms through functional genomics, such as gene
          co-expression analyses and clustering of complex traits. Addressing
          these challenges will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding
          of genetic associations and their implications for precision medicine.

          identify biological processes underlying human diseases. 


          Content: A prominent method, transcription-wide association studies
          (TWAS), integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to
          offer a mechanistic interpretation of genome-wide association study
          (GWAS) findings by examining individual genes [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;

          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. TWAS has achieved remarkable success
          in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level and has
          further proven beneficial in predicting disease risk (polygenic
          scores) and drug repurposing [@pmid:33931583;

          focuses on individual gene-level perturbations and does not account
          for more intricate interactions at the network level.


          Conclusion: Bridging this knowledge gap requires addressing complex
          interactions among genes within biological networks to better

          Context: The increasing availability of gene expression data across
          various tissues offers a valuable resource for understanding complex
          biological processes and their implications in human diseases. A
          widely used approach, Transcription-Wide Association Studies (TWAS),
          has been successful in interpreting Genome-Wide Association Study
          (GWAS) findings by integrating expression Quantitative Trait Loci
          (eQTLs) data at the individual gene level [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. However, this method does not
          account for higher-level interactions within gene networks.


          Content: TWAS relies on testing whether perturbations in gene
          regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants
          and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;
          @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889;
          @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This strategy has proven effective not only in
          elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome level
          [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433],
          but also in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)

          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].


          Conclusion: Despite the success of TWAS, its focus on individual gene
          analysis leaves a gap in understanding more intricate interactions at
          the network level. This manuscript addresses this knowledge gap by
          employing a systems biology approach that combines genetic studies and
          functional genomics to investigate gene co-expression patterns, aiming
          to highlight disease etiology, therapeutic targets, and opportunities
          for drug repurposing, particularly in relation to complex traits
          clustering.

          Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues has
          enabled the development of computational methods to identify
          biological processes associated with these data. One such approach is
          the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which offers a
          mechanistic interpretation for genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
          findings by integrating expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data.


          Content: TWAS operates at the individual gene level, thereby
          overlooking more intricate interactions at the network level. This
          method tests whether disturbances in gene regulatory mechanisms
          mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases,
          and has been highly successful in understanding disease etiology at
          the transcriptome level. Moreover, TWAS has shown promise in
          disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) and drug repurposing tasks.


          Conclusion: Despite these achievements, TWAS does not account for
          complex interactions at the network level. Addressing this knowledge
          gap is crucial for a more comprehensive understanding of gene
          regulation and its role in human diseases. The current manuscript aims
          to contribute to filling this gap by proposing an innovative approach
          that captures both individual gene-level associations and higher-order
          network interactions.

          Content: A prominent method, transcription-wide association studies
          (TWAS), integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to
          offer a mechanistic interpretation of genome-wide association study

              In the complex world of genetics, genes do not operate in
              isolation but rather collaborate within context-specific networks
              to execute various functions [@pmid:19104045;
              @doi:10.1038/ng.3259]. Minor alterations in these genes can
              significantly impact their functional roles, ultimately
              influencing disease-relevant biological processes
              [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6]. Unraveling the intricate
              relationship between genes and complex traits necessitates a
              profound understanding of expression regulation across diverse
              cell types [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
              @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3; @doi:10.1038/s41576-019-0200-9].
              This knowledge, once acquired, has the potential to significantly
              enhance treatment strategies [@doi:10.1038/ng.3314;
              @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008489].


              Previous research has shed light on various regulatory DNA
              elements, including genetic effects on gene expression across
              different tissues [@doi:10.1038/nature11247;
              @doi:10.1038/nature14248; @doi:10.1038/nature12787;

              markedly improved the identification of these transcriptional
              mechanisms. Dysregulation of these mechanisms often leads to
              tissue-specific and cell lineage-specific pathology
              [@pmid:20624743; @pmid:14707169; @doi:10.1073/pnas.0810772105].
              However, a significant knowledge gap remains in understanding how
              these genetic associations can be projected through gene
              expression patterns to highlight disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms. This is the critical gap that the current study aims
              to address.

              the identification of transcriptional mechanisms, which, when
              dysregulated, often result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific
              pathology. For instance, genetic variants can alter the functional
              role of genes, thereby affecting disease-relevant biological
              processes [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259;

              Conclusion: Despite these findings, a knowledge gap remains in
              understanding how gene expression regulation varies across
              different cell types and how this variation influences complex
              traits and disease susceptibility. The current manuscript aims to
              address this gap by investigating the role of context-specific
              gene networks and their impact on disease-relevant biological
              processes.

              In the complex world of genetics, genes do not function in
              isolation but rather collaborate within context-specific networks
              to execute various cellular functions [@pmid:19104045;
              @doi:10.1038/ng.3259]. Minor alterations in these genetic
              sequences can significantly impact their functional roles,
              ultimately influencing disease-relevant biological processes
              [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6]. A critical aspect of
              understanding how genes contribute to complex traits lies in
              elucidating the mechanisms of gene expression regulation across
              diverse cell types [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;

              This knowledge has the potential to enhance treatment options
              [@doi:10.1038/ng.3314; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008489].


              Previous research has identified different regulatory DNA
              elements, including genetic effects on gene expression across
              various tissues [@doi:10.1038/nature11247;

              Furthermore, integrating functional genomics data and GWAS
              (genome-wide association studies) data
              [@doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0081-4; @doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.04.002;

              significantly improved the detection of transcriptional
              mechanisms. Disruptions in these mechanisms often lead to tissue-
              and cell lineage-specific pathology [@pmid:20624743;

              of how genes and their regulatory elements contribute to complex
              traits and tissue-specific pathology remains elusive. This
              manuscript addresses this knowledge gap by investigating the role
              of specific genetic variations in gene expression regulation and
              disease processes across various cell types and tissues.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining
              the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the
              following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance
              clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The
              revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a
              Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure
              begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context),
              progresses through what is known from the literature (Content),
              and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap the
              manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1)
              preserve the original information as much as possible, with
              minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to
              scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the
              original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
              and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as
              "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;

              the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a
              single, cohesive paragraph.

              In the complex world of genetics, genes do not function in
              isolation but rather collaborate within context-specific networks
              to carry out various cellular functions [@pmid:19104045;
              @doi:10.1038/ng.3259]. Minor genetic variations can alter these
              functional roles, ultimately impacting disease-relevant biological
              processes [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6]. A deeper
              understanding of how genes influence complex traits hinges on
              elucidating the mechanisms of gene expression regulation across
              different cell types [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
              @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3; @doi:10.1038/s41576-019-0200-9].
              This knowledge, in turn, should facilitate the development of more
              effective treatments [@doi:10.1038/ng.3314;
              @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008489].


              Previous research has identified various regulatory DNA elements,
              including genetic effects on gene expression across diverse
              tissues [@doi:10.1038/nature11247; @doi:10.1038/nature14248;

              enhanced the identification of transcriptional mechanisms.
              Dysregulation of these mechanisms often leads to tissue- and cell
              lineage-specific pathology [@pmid:20624743; @pmid:14707169;
              @doi:10.1073/pnas.0810772105]. However, the current understanding
              of gene co-expression patterns and their relationship to disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms remains incomplete.


              This manuscript aims to address this knowledge gap by projecting
              genetic associations through gene expression patterns, thereby
              highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms [@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]. By employing a
              clustering approach for complex traits, we aim to identify
              therapeutic targets and explore opportunities for drug
              repurposing.

              Context: Genes function in a complex network, and variations
              within these genes can have significant consequences on
              disease-relevant biological processes. Understanding how genes
              influence such traits necessitates a mechanistic grasp of gene
              expression regulation across diverse cell types. While previous
              studies have shed light on various regulatory DNA elements and the
              genetic effects on gene expression across tissues, there remains a
              need to identify transcriptional mechanisms that, when
              dysregulated, commonly result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific
              pathology.


              Content: Genes operate in context-specific networks to carry out
              different functions [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259].
              Variations in these genes can change their functional role and, at

              elements and genetic effects on gene expression across tissues,
              there is still a need to enhance our understanding of the

              powerful approach to dissect these processes is the
              transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which amalgamates
              expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to elucidate the
              mechanistic underpinnings of GWAS findings. TWAS functions by
              examining whether alterations in gene regulatory mechanisms

              Input paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data
              across several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;

              Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues
              has paved the way for novel approaches to identify biological
              processes and understand disease etiology [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;

              @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. 


              Content: One such method, the transcription-wide association study
              (TWAS), has proven successful in this regard by integrating
              expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a
              mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS functions by
              testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms

              TWAS approaches have not only contributed to understanding disease

              Conclusion: Despite the success of TWAS in analyzing gene
              regulatory mechanisms at an individual level, there remains a need
              to explore more complex interactions at the network level, thereby
              addressing a critical knowledge gap in functional genomics and its

              With the increasing abundance of gene expression data across
              various tissues ([@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838];

              @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9), a powerful approach to discern
              biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
              (TWAS). This method amalgamates expression quantitative trait loci
              (eQTLs) data to furnish a mechanistic understanding of GWAS
              findings. TWAS operates by examining whether disruptions in gene
              regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between genetic variants
              and human diseases ([@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482];

              @doi:10.1038/ng.3367), and it has achieved remarkable success in
              elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome level
              ([@pmid:33931583]; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;
              @pmid:31036433). Furthermore, TWAS has proven beneficial in
              disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)
              ([@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w]) and drug repurposing tasks
              ([@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]). Nevertheless, TWAS functions at the
              individual gene level, thereby overlooking more intricate
              interactions at the network level.

              Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues
              has paved the way for novel approaches to identify biological
              processes underlying human diseases. 


              Content: A prominent method in this regard is the
              transcription-wide association study (TWAS)
              (@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;
              @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9). By
              integrating expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data, TWAS
              offers a mechanistic interpretation for genetic associations
              uncovered by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This approach
              tests whether alterations in gene regulatory mechanisms serve as
              mediators between genetic variants and diseases
              (@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
              @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367). Such
              efforts have significantly advanced our understanding of disease
              etiology at the transcriptome level and contributed to
              disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)

              (@doi:10.1038/nn.4618).


              Conclusion: Despite TWAS's success at the individual gene level,
              there remains a need to explore more complex interactions at the
              network level, which may further elucidate disease etiology and
              reveal novel therapeutic targets and strategies for drug
              repurposing. The current manuscript aims to address this knowledge
              gap by employing a clustering of complex traits strategy within
              the functional genomics framework, focusing on gene co-expression
              patterns and their implications for genetic associations.

              Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues
              has paved the way for novel approaches to identify biological
              processes underlying human diseases. 


              Content: A prominent method in this regard is the
              transcription-wide association study (TWAS)
              (@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;
              @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9). By
              integrating expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data, TWAS
              offers a mechanistic interpretation for genome-wide association
              studies (GWAS) findings, testing whether gene regulatory mechanism
              perturbations mediate the relationship between genetic variants
              and diseases (@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;

              (@doi:10.1038/nn.4618).


              Conclusion: Despite TWAS's individual gene level focus, there
              remains a need to explore more complex interactions at the network
              level, specifically through the lens of genetic studies,
              functional genomics, and gene co-expression. This knowledge gap
              warrants further investigation into the clustering of complex

              biological processes and their implications in human diseases. 


              Content: A prominent approach to leverage this data is through
              transcription-wide association studies (TWAS)
              [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;

              Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues
              has enabled researchers to investigate biological processes in a
              more comprehensive and integrated manner. 


              Content: A notable approach that leverages this wealth of data is
              the transcription-wide association study (TWAS). TWAS integrates
              expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a

              @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], TWAS has emerged as an effective
              approach to identify disease-relevant biological processes by
              integrating expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data. This
              method offers a mechanistic interpretation for genome-wide
              association study (GWAS) findings at the individual gene level.
              However, one limitation of TWAS is its focus on single genes,
              which may overlook more intricate interactions at the network
              level.


              Context: Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) are used to
              understand the relationship between genetic variants and human
              diseases by examining perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms.


              Content: These approaches have been successful in several areas,
              including disease etiology at the transcriptome level,
              disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores, and drug
              repurposing. With the abundance of gene expression data across
              various tissues, TWAS has emerged as an effective approach to
              identify disease-relevant biological processes by integrating
              expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data. This method
              offers a mechanistic interpretation for genome-wide association
              study (GWAS) findings at the individual gene level.


              Conclusion: A limitation of TWAS is its focus on single genes,
              which may overlook more intricate interactions at the network
              level, highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap this manuscript

              Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) are genetic methods
              that investigate whether alterations in gene regulatory mechanisms
              underlie the association between genetic variants and human

              contributed to understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome
              level ([@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;

              prediction (polygenic scores) ([@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w])
              and drug repurposing tasks ([@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]). The

              Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) are a class of
              genetic analysis methods that aim to uncover the relationship
              between perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms and the
              association between genetic variants and human diseases

              approaches have been highly successful in several aspects,
              including understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome
              level ([@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;
              @pmid:31036433]), disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores
              ([@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w]), and drug repurposing tasks
              ([@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]). This success can be attributed to the
              availability of gene expression data across various tissues
              ([@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;

              Despite the success of TWAS in identifying gene-level
              associations, it does not capture more complex interactions at the
              network level.


              In this study, we propose to address this knowledge gap by
              projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns.
              Specifically, we aim to highlight disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms by integrating functional genomics data with TWAS
              findings. By clustering complex traits and identifying
              co-expressed genes, our approach will shed light on the
              network-level interactions that underlie human diseases. In doing
              so, we hope to uncover novel therapeutic targets for drug
              repurposing and development.

              made TWAS an attractive approach for identifying
              disease-associated biological processes. At its core, TWAS
              integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to
              offer a mechanistic interpretation of GWAS findings. Nonetheless,
              TWAS operates at the individual gene level, which presents a
              limitation in capturing more intricate interactions at the network
              level.


              In summary, while TWAS has proven valuable for identifying
              disease-associated genetic variants and interpreting their
              mechanisms through eQTLs integration, its focus on individual
              genes may overlook complex interactions at higher levels of
              organization within biological systems. Addressing this knowledge
              gap is crucial for a more comprehensive understanding of the
              intricate relationship between genetics, gene regulation, and
              human diseases.

              thereby providing a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.
              However, it is important to note that TWAS operates at the

              interactions occurring at the network level.

              Context: Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) have
              emerged as a powerful tool in the field of functional genomics,
              elucidating disease etiology and informing drug development by
              examining the relationship between genetic variants and gene
              regulatory mechanisms. 


              Content: TWAS approaches test whether perturbations in gene
              regulatory mechanisms mediate associations between genetic
              variants and human diseases, proving successful in understanding
              disease etiology at the transcriptome level, predicting disease
              risk through polygenic scores, and repurposing drugs
              [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;

              @doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w; @doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. The
              abundance of gene expression data across various tissues has
              facilitated the use of TWAS, which integrates expression
              quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic
              interpretation for genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings

              Conclusion: Despite TWAS's success at the individual gene level,
              there remains a need to explore more complex interactions at the
              network level. The present manuscript aims to address this
              knowledge gap by proposing a method that projects genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns, highlighting
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms while considering intricate
              network-level interactions.

              Transcription-wide Association Studies (TWAS) are a class of
              analytical methods that aim to understand the relationship between
              genetic variants and human diseases by examining perturbations in
              gene regulatory mechanisms [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;
              @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889;
              @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. These approaches have been successful in
              several applications, including elucidating disease etiology at
              the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433], predicting

              @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], TWAS offers a valuable approach
              to identify biological processes by integrating expression
              quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data, thereby providing a
              mechanistic interpretation for Genome-wide Association Studies
              (GWAS) findings. However, TWAS operates at the individual gene
              level, which may overlook more intricate interactions occurring at
              the network level.


              In summary, while TWAS has proven to be a powerful tool in
              identifying perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms associated
              with human diseases, its focus on individual genes means that it
              may not fully capture complex interactions at the network level.
              This knowledge gap underscores the need for further research and
              methodological development in this area.

              Context: The increasing abundance of gene expression data across
              various tissues has facilitated the development of novel methods
              to identify biological processes associated with genetic
              variants. 


              Content: A prominent approach in this regard is the
              transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which amalgamates
              expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a

              expression patterns, which can highlight disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms by capturing complex interactions among genes in

              Conclusion: Despite the accomplishments of TWAS in interpreting

              critical knowledge gap regarding the comprehension of complex
              interactions among genetic variants within biological networks.
              This manuscript aims to address this gap by proposing a novel
              approach that integrates systems biology and machine learning
              techniques to capture these elusive network-level interactions,
              thereby enhancing our understanding of the genetic architecture

              Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues
              has paved the way for novel approaches to identify biological
              processes underlying human diseases. 


              Content: A prominent method in this regard is the
              transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates
              expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a
              mechanistic interpretation of GWAS findings at the individual gene
              level [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;
              @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9].
              TWAS has been successful in understanding disease etiology at the
              transcriptome level and has contributed to disease-risk prediction
              (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug
              repurposing tasks [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. However, TWAS focuses on
              individual gene-level analysis and does not account for more
              intricate interactions at the network level.


              Conclusion: Bridging this knowledge gap, our manuscript introduces
              a novel approach that projects genetic associations through gene
              expression patterns, capturing complex interactions at the network
              level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;
              @pmid:31036433]. This advancement in functional genomics allows
              for a more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology, drug
              mechanisms, and therapeutic targets by clustering complex traits
              within gene co-expression networks.

              has enabled the development of computational methods to identify
              biological processes associated with these data. 


              Content: A prominent approach is the Transcription-Wide

              TWAS functions at the individual gene level, but it does not

              etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;

              Conclusion: Despite these advances, TWAS's focus on individual
              gene level interactions leaves a knowledge gap regarding more
              complex network-level interactions. Addressing this gap could
              provide further insights into disease etiology and improve disease
              risk prediction and drug repurposing strategies.

              Context: The increasing accessibility of gene expression data
              across various tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
              @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
              @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9] has paved the way for novel
              analytical methods to identify underlying biological processes.
              One such approach, the transcription-wide association study
              (TWAS), offers a mechanistic interpretation for genome-wide
              association studies (GWAS) findings by integrating expression
              quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data.


              Content: TWAS functions at the individual gene level, thereby
              overlooking more intricate interactions at the network level. This
              method tests whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms
              mediate the association between genetic variants and human
              diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
              @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. Such
              TWAS-based approaches have proven highly successful in several
              areas, including understanding disease etiology at the
              transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433], disease-risk
              prediction through polygenic scores

              [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].


              Conclusion: Notwithstanding these achievements, TWAS's focus on
              individual gene analysis may limit its ability to fully capture
              the complex interplay of genes within biological networks. This
              knowledge gap underscores the need for complementary methods that
              can elucidate higher-order gene interactions and further reveal
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms through functional genomics,
              such as gene co-expression analyses and clustering of complex
              traits. Addressing these challenges will contribute to a more
              comprehensive understanding of genetic associations and their
              implications for precision medicine.

              Context: The advent of gene expression data across numerous
              tissues has paved the way for sophisticated bioinformatics
              approaches to identify biological processes underlying human
              diseases. 


              Content: A prominent method, transcription-wide association
              studies (TWAS), integrates expression quantitative trait loci
              (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic interpretation of genome-wide
              association study (GWAS) findings by examining individual genes
              [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;

              TWAS has achieved remarkable success in understanding disease
              etiology at the transcriptome level and has further proven
              beneficial in predicting disease risk (polygenic scores) and drug
              repurposing [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;

              gene-level perturbations and does not account for more intricate
              interactions at the network level.


              Conclusion: Bridging this knowledge gap requires addressing
              complex interactions among genes within biological networks to
              better understand disease etiology and improve disease risk
              prediction, polygenic score calculations, and drug repurposing

              Context: The increasing availability of gene expression data
              across various tissues offers a valuable resource for
              understanding complex biological processes and their implications
              in human diseases. A widely used approach, Transcription-Wide
              Association Studies (TWAS), has been successful in interpreting
              Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) findings by integrating
              expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTLs) data at the individual
              gene level [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
              @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
              @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. However, this method does not
              account for higher-level interactions within gene networks.


              Content: TWAS relies on testing whether perturbations in gene
              regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic
              variants and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;

              @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This strategy has proven effective not only
              in elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome level
              [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;

              tasks [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].


              Conclusion: Despite the success of TWAS, its focus on individual
              gene analysis leaves a gap in understanding more intricate
              interactions at the network level. This manuscript addresses this
              knowledge gap by employing a systems biology approach that
              combines genetic studies and functional genomics to investigate
              gene co-expression patterns, aiming to highlight disease etiology,
              therapeutic targets, and opportunities for drug repurposing,
              particularly in relation to complex traits clustering.

              Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues
              has enabled the development of computational methods to identify
              biological processes associated with these data. One such approach
              is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which offers a
              mechanistic interpretation for genome-wide association studies
              (GWAS) findings by integrating expression quantitative trait loci
              (eQTLs) data.


              Content: TWAS operates at the individual gene level, thereby
              overlooking more intricate interactions at the network level. This
              method tests whether disturbances in gene regulatory mechanisms
              mediate the association between genetic variants and human
              diseases, and has been highly successful in understanding disease
              etiology at the transcriptome level. Moreover, TWAS has shown
              promise in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) and drug
              repurposing tasks.


              Conclusion: Despite these achievements, TWAS does not account for
              complex interactions at the network level. Addressing this
              knowledge gap is crucial for a more comprehensive understanding of
              gene regulation and its role in human diseases. The current
              manuscript aims to contribute to filling this gap by proposing an
              innovative approach that captures both individual gene-level
              associations and higher-order network interactions.

              Context: The advent of gene expression data across various tissues
              has paved the way for novel approaches to identify biological
              processes linked to genetic variants. 


              Content: A prominent method, transcription-wide association
              studies (TWAS), integrates expression quantitative trait loci
              (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic interpretation of genome-wide
              association study (GWAS) findings by examining individual genes
              [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;
              @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9].
              TWAS has proven successful in understanding disease etiology at
              the transcriptome level, predicting disease risk through polygenic
              scores, and repurposing drugs [@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433;
              @doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w; @doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. However,
              TWAS focuses on individual gene-level analysis, overlooking more
              intricate network-level interactions.


              Conclusion: This study aims to address the knowledge gap in
              capturing complex interactions at the network level by clustering
              co-expressed genes and examining their associations with genetic
              variants and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;

              @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. By employing a systems biology approach, we
              expect to shed light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms from
              the perspective of gene co-expression and functional genomics,
              contributing to therapeutic targets and drug repurposing efforts.

              perturbations in these systems contribute to disease
              susceptibility and progression. Our manuscript aims to address
