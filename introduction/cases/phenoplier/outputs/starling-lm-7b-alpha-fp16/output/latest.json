Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format \"[@TYPE:ID]\" such as \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes work together in context-specific networks to karry out different functions [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259].

Previous research has identified various regulatory DNA elements, including genetic effects on gene expression across different tissues, such as [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3; @doi:10.1038/s41576-019-0200-9]. Integrating functional genomics data with GWAS data, like [@doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0081-4; @doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.04.002; @pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0081-4; @doi:10.1038/ncomms6890] has helped identify transcriptional mechanisms that, when dysregulated, often result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology, as evidenced by [@pmid:20624743; @pmid:14707169; @doi:10.1038/0810772105].\n\nThe revised paragraph incorporates the C-C-C structure, starting with the context of genes interacting in a complex manner and their potential to impact disease processes. The content section discusses the importance of understanding gene expression regulation across different cell types, citing relevant studies. Finally, the conclusion highlights the progress made by integrating functional genomics data with GWAS data and its role in identifying transcriptional mechanisms that lead to tissue-specific pathology."

Integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data has improved the identification of transcriptional mechanisms that, when dysregulated, commonly result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology [@pmid:20624743; @pmid:14707169; @doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0081-4; @doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.04.002; @doi:10.1038/ncomms6890]. However, there is still a knowledge gap in understanding how these regulatory mechanisms contribute to the overall gene expression landscape and disease progression, which this manuscript aims to address."

Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format \"[@TYPE:ID]\" such as \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.

Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format \"[@TYPE:ID]\" such as \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.

The revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure.

Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format \"[@TYPE:ID]\" such as \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: TWAS relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks.

One effective approach to achieve this is through transcription-wide association studies (TWAS), which integrate expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for genetic associations found in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, TWAS focuses on individual genes and does not capture the more complex interactions at the network level.

It provides a clearer understanding of TWAS's role in gene regulatory mechanisms and its applications in disease etiology, risk prediction, and drug repurposing tasks."

One effective approach to analyze this data is through transcription-wide association studies (TWAS), which integrate expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) information to provide a mechanistic interpretation of genetic variants' associations with human diseases. TWAS investigates whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate these associations [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367].

Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format \"[@TYPE:ID]\" such as \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.

Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format \"[@TYPE:ID]\" such as \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks.

Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format \"[@TYPE:ID]\" such as \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.

Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format \"[@TYPE:ID]\" such as \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: TWAS relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks.

Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format \"[@TYPE:ID]\" such as \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: TWAS relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks.

Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format \"[@TYPE:ID]\" such as \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: TWAS relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks.

Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format \"[@TYPE:ID]\" such as \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.

Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format \"[@TYPE:ID]\" such as \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.
