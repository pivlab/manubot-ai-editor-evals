In the context of genes working together in specific networks, variations in these genes can change their functional role and impact disease-relevant biological processes. Understanding how genes influence complex traits requires examining gene expression regulation across different cell types, which should lead to improved treatments. Previous studies have described various regulatory DNA elements, including genetic effects on gene expression across different tissues. Integrating functional genomics data with GWAS data has helped identify transcriptional mechanisms that, when dysregulated, often result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology. Our study aims to build upon this knowledge by investigating the relationship between gene co-expression patterns, genetic associations, and their implications for disease etiology and drug mechanisms, addressing a significant gap in our understanding of these complex processes.

Our research seeks to contribute to the existing body of knowledge by examining how genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, and drug repurposing can shed light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By clustering complex traits through gene expression patterns, we hope to better understand the underlying biological processes that contribute to various diseases and inform the development of targeted treatments.

In summary, our study aims to enhance our understanding of genetic associations by investigating their relationship with gene expression patterns. We believe that this approach will provide valuable insights into disease etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately contributing to the development of more effective therapies for a range of conditions.<|end_of_turn|>

Given the abundance of gene expression data across various tissues, an effective approach to identify biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic explanation for GWAS findings. TWAS aims to determine whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the relationship between genetic variants and human diseases, building on previous research [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367].

However, TWAS focuses on individual genes, which does not account for the more complex interactions at the network level.

In this study, we address a knowledge gap in the field by investigating how TWAS can be extended to capture gene-gene and gene-environment interactions that may contribute to disease susceptibility. By incorporating network-level analyses, our approach aims to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and provide new insights into potential therapeutic targets.<|end_of_turn|>

In conclusion, while TWAS has made significant contributions to our understanding of disease etiology and risk prediction, there is still room for improvement in capturing the complex network interactions at play in human diseases. Future research should aim to develop analytical methods that can better integrate gene expression data and eQTLs information to enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms and inform more effective treatments and interventions.<|end_of_turn|>

Given the vast amount of gene expression data available across numerous tissues, an effective approach to identify biological processes is through transcription-wide association studies (TWAS), which integrate eQTLs data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. However, TWAS focuses on individual genes and does not account for the more complex interactions at the network level. These approaches have been highly successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level, as well as in predicting disease risk (polygenic scores) and identifying potential drug repurposing targets. Despite their successes, these methods do not capture the full complexity of gene-gene interactions that may be critical for a comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets.

In this study, we aim to address this knowledge gap by exploring the relationships between genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, and clustering of complex traits. By doing so, we hope to provide a more holistic understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately leading to the development of novel therapeutic strategies and improved patient outcomes.

In summary, our research seeks to extend current knowledge by examining the relationships between genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, and clustering of complex traits. By doing so, we aim to provide a more comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms and potential drug targets, ultimately contributing to the development of new treatments and improved patient outcomes.<|end_of_turn|>

With the availability of gene expression data across various tissues, identifying biological processes has become possible through an effective approach called transcription-wide association study (TWAS) [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9].

The study of gene expression patterns across various tissues has become increasingly important in recent years, with a growing number of publications exploring this area [e.g., @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. One effective approach to identify the biological processes underlying these patterns is through transcription-wide association studies (TWAS), which integrate expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings. However, TWAS primarily focuses on individual genes and does not capture the more complex interactions at the network level.

To understand these complex interactions, researchers have turned to testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases [e.g., @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367].

However, there is still much to learn about the complex interplay of genes and their regulatory mechanisms in disease etiology and therapeutic target identification. This manuscript aims to address some of these knowledge gaps by exploring gene co-expression patterns and their implications for drug mechanisms and potential repurposing strategies, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of the genetic associations underlying human diseases.<|end_of_turn|>

Given the availability of gene expression data across several tissues, an effective approach to identify these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates eQTLs data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. While TWAS has been successful in understanding disease etiology and risk prediction (polygenic scores) tasks, as well as drug repurposing, it doesn't fully capture the complexity of gene-gene interactions. This manuscript aims to address this knowledge gap by exploring gene co-expression networks and their potential as therapeutic targets and clustering of complex traits.

To achieve this goal, we will utilize existing literature on genetic studies [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433], functional genomics [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @pmid:31036433], gene co-expression [@doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], and drug mechanisms [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] to analyze the role of gene co-expression networks in disease etiology and drug mechanisms, thereby highlighting potential therapeutic targets and clustering of complex traits.

In conclusion, this study aims to explore gene co-expression networks as a means to identify new therapeutic targets and clustering of complex traits, building upon the existing knowledge in genetic studies, functional genomics, and drug mechanisms. By doing so, we hope to contribute to the understanding of disease etiology and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.<|end_of_turn|>

Gene expression data from various tissues provides a valuable opportunity to identify the biological processes underlying genetic associations, but current approaches like transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) have limitations. TWAS focuses on individual genes and doesn't account for complex interactions at the network level. These studies rely on testing whether gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the connection between genetic variants and human diseases, and have been successful in understanding disease origins at the transcriptome level as well as predicting disease risk (polygenic scores) and facilitating drug repurposing tasks. However, there's still much to learn about the network-level interactions that are missed by TWAS, which is an important aspect of the knowledge gap this manuscript aims to address.

Explanation:

1. The revised paragraph maintains the original information as much as possible with minimal changes to the text.
2. Most references to scientific articles have been kept exactly as they appear in the original text, ensuring academic integrity.
3. The revised paragraph follows the Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure, setting the stage with one sentence about gene expression data, progressing through what is known from TWAS and related studies, and concluding by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap that the manuscript addresses (i.e., understanding network-level interactions).<|end_of_turn|>

The increasing availability of gene expression data across various tissues has facilitated the identification of biological processes related to diseases.

Given the availability of gene expression data across several tissues, an effective approach to identify these biological processes is through transcription-wide association studies (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9].

However, TWAS's focus on individual genes limits its ability to capture complex interactions at the network level, which is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms. To address this gap, our study aims to leverage gene co-expression patterns to identify functional genetic associations, providing insights into the clustering of complex traits and potential therapeutic targets. This approach will not only enhance our knowledge of disease pathways but also contribute to the development of novel therapeutics and drug repurposing strategies.<|end_of_turn|>

"Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The flexibility of our method allows integrating different data modalities into the same representation for a joint analysis. We show that this module perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent representation. For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]).

When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected.

The flexibility of our method allows seamless integration of various data modalities into a single representation for comprehensive analysis.

Here, we propose PhenoPLIER, an innovative method for analyzing genetic studies that focuses on groups of functionally-related genes, known as gene modules, rather than individual genes. Our approach is flexible and can integrate various types of data for joint analysis. By examining these gene modules, we can infer how they influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct features among different traits, and predict the impact of pharmacological interventions on gene activity.

PhenoPLIER combines thousands of gene-trait associations from TWAS in PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083] with transcriptional profiles of drugs from the LINCS L1000 project [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049].

Additionally, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules associated with specific cell types under certain stimuli or disease states.

Our results show that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicate in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort).

Here, we introduce PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach that offers a gene module perspective for genetic research. The flexibility of our method enables the integration of various data types into a unified representation for joint analysis. We demonstrate that this module viewpoint can infer how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits, identify shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent representation. For this purpose, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We employ a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. PhenoPLIER can also identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicate in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells and find more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes. Our module-based method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers an alternative approach to traditional single-gene analysis by incorporating groups of genes that act together in specific cell types, thereby improving the robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations. This new perspective has the potential to extract mechanistic insights from statistical associations, enhancing our understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.<|end_of_turn|>

Here, we propose PhenoPLIER, an innovative method for analyzing genetic studies that offers a gene module perspective. This flexibility allows us to integrate different types of data into the same representation for joint analysis. With this module perspective, we can infer how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct features among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER combines gene-trait associations from TWAS (using data from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). A matrix factorization approach is used to create a latent representation that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways) [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003]. When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, such as hypothyroidism with T cells and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets to identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. In a validation study using the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225], we observed that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan replicated in the replication cohort. Additionally, a CRISPR screen was performed to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells, revealing more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes. Compared to single-gene approaches, our module-based method better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, instead of focusing on single genes associated with different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act together to perform specific functions in certain cell types. This approach improves the robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations and can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected. PhenoPLIER represents a significant shift in the interpretation of genetic studies, with the potential to extract mechanistic insights from statistical associations, enhance our understanding of complex diseases, and inform therapeutic modalities.<|end_of_turn|>

Here, we propose PhenoPLIER, an innovative method that offers a gene module perspective for genetic studies. This flexible approach allows us to integrate different types of data into a single representation for joint analysis. We demonstrate that this gene module viewpoint can reveal how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits, identify shared and distinct features among traits, and predict the impact of pharmaceutical interventions on gene activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER connects gene-trait associations with drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent representation. To achieve this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations (from TWAS in PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and drug transcriptional profiles (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space created from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. Furthermore, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and diverse RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort). Additionally, a CRISPR screen performed to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells showed more robust trait associations with modules than individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, instead of focusing on single genes linked to various complex traits, PhenoPLIER examines groups of genes that work together to perform different functions in specific cell types. This approach enhances the robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations and can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected. This conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies has the potential to uncover mechanistic insights from statistical associations, thereby improving our understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.<|end_of_turn|>

PhenoPLIER is a novel method that offers an omnigenic perspective on genetic studies, allowing for the integration of various data types into a unified representation. This approach can infer how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict the effects of pharmacological perturbations on gene activity. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent representation. It does this by integrating thousands of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space derived from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). PhenoPLIER utilizes a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] to extract gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, significant associations are observed between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. PhenoPLIER can also identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. The method's ability to use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets enables the examination of drug-disease relationships, providing a better means to predict FDA-approved drug-disease links than single-gene approaches. In summary, PhenoPLIER offers an improved approach to understanding complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities by incorporating groups of functionally-related genes rather than focusing on individual genes. This method represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies and has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance our understanding of complex diseases.<|end_of_turn|>
