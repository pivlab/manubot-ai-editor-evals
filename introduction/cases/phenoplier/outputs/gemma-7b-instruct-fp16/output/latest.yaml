          Sure, here is the revised paragraph:


          Genes function in context-specific networks to carry out diverse
          functions. Variations in these genes can alter their functional roles
          and, at a higher level, affect disease-related biological processes.
          To understand complex traits, it is crucial to mechanistically dissect
          gene expression regulation across different cell types, as this
          knowledge can lead to improved treatments. Previous studies have
          described various regulatory DNA elements and their genetic effects on
          gene expression across different tissues. Integrating functional
          genomics data and GWAS data has significantly improved the
          identification of these transcriptional mechanisms, which, when
          dysregulated, commonly result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific
          pathology.

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          paragraph from the introduction of this manuscript so that it has a
          clear sentence structure, fits in a single paragraph, and keeps most
          references to papers (e.g. [@doi:...]). At a high level, the revision
          should highlight a gap in existing knowledge or methods, convey why it
          matters, and suggest how the manuscript aims to fill it. It may cover
          relevant literature to explain current knowledge, but only so far as
          is relevant to the motivation of the manuscript. It may be somewhat
          specific about results, relative to a typical high-level abstract
          section for example. More specifically, the revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          The existing literature describes various genetic elements and their
          impact on gene expression across different tissues. However,
          understanding the complex relationship between genetic variations and
          their functional consequences in disease remains a significant
          challenge. This is because tissue- and cell lineage-specific
          regulation of gene expression, which is key to understanding complex
          traits, has been poorly characterized. Previous studies have
          identified regulatory DNA elements and their genetic effects on gene
          expression across different tissues. However, integrating functional
          genomics data and GWAS data has been limited. To address this gap,
          this manuscript proposes a novel approach to project genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns. This approach will
          elucidate the mechanisms underlying tissue- and cell lineage-specific
          regulation of gene expression and provide insights into the
          development of new therapeutic targets. By integrating functional
          genomics data and GWAS data, this study aims to identify and
          characterize tissue- and cell lineage-specific regulatory networks
          underlying complex traits.

          Sure, here is the revised paragraph:


          Genetic regulation of gene expression plays a pivotal role in shaping
          complex traits. Genes function in context-specific networks, and
          variations in these genes can alter their functional roles and
          influence disease-related biological processes. To understand how
          genes influence complex traits, it is crucial to mechanistically
          dissect the regulation of gene expression across different cell types.
          Previous studies have identified regulatory DNA elements and genetic
          effects on gene expression across tissues. However, integrating
          functional genomics data and GWAS data has significantly improved the
          identification of these transcriptional mechanisms. These mechanisms,
          when dysregulated, commonly result in tissue- and cell
          lineage-specific pathology. This manuscript aims to address this gap
          by exploring the relationship between gene expression patterns and
          complex traits. By characterizing the genetic associations underlying
          complex traits, we can pave the way for improved treatments and
          personalized medicine.

          Genes function in context-specific networks to carry out diverse
          functions. Variations in these genes can alter their functional roles
          and impact disease-related biological processes. To elucidate how
          genes influence complex traits, it is crucial to understand their
          regulation across different cell types, which ultimately leads to

          elements and genetic effects on gene expression across various
          tissues. Integrating functional genomics and GWAS data has further
          enhanced the identification of transcriptional mechanisms that, when
          dysregulated, commonly result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific
          pathology.

          The complex interplay of genes in context-specific networks
          orchestrates a vast array of biological functions. Variations in these
          genes can alter their functional roles, influencing disease-related
          biological processes. To decipher the intricate mechanisms underlying
          complex traits, a deep understanding of gene expression regulation
          across different cell types is paramount. While previous studies have
          shed light on regulatory DNA elements and genetic effects on gene
          expression, a key gap remains in our understanding of how these
          mechanisms contribute to tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology.
          This manuscript aims to bridge this gap by integrating functional
          genomics and GWAS data to uncover transcriptional mechanisms that are
          commonly dysregulated in various diseases. By elucidating these
          mechanisms, this research paves the way for the development of novel
          therapies tailored to specific cell types and tissues.

          Sure, here is the revised paragraph:


          Genes work together in context-specific networks to carry out
          different functions. Variations in these genes can alter their
          functional role and, at a higher level, affect disease-relevant
          biological processes. To understand how genes influence complex
          traits, it is crucial to mechanistically understand expression
          regulation across different cell types, which can lead to improved
          treatments. Previous studies have described different regulatory DNA
          elements, including genetic effects on gene expression across
          different tissues. Integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data
          has improved the identification of these transcriptional mechanisms
          that, when dysregulated, commonly result in tissue- and cell
          lineage-specific pathology.

          paragraph from the introduction of this manuscript so that it has a
          clear sentence structure, fits in a single paragraph, and keeps most
          references to papers (e.g. [@doi:...]). At a high level, the revision
          should highlight a gap in existing knowledge or methods, convey why it
          matters, and suggest how the manuscript aims to fill it. It may cover
          relevant literature to explain current knowledge, but only so far as
          is relevant to the motivation of the manuscript. It may be somewhat
          specific about results, relative to a typical high-level abstract
          section for example. More specifically, the revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          The complex regulation of gene expression plays a pivotal role in
          orchestrating various cellular functions. Variations in genes that
          encode regulators of these processes can lead to altered functional
          roles and impact disease-related biological pathways. To elucidate how
          genes influence complex traits, a mechanistic understanding of
          expression regulation across different cell types is crucial. Despite
          previous studies describing regulatory DNA elements and their impact
          on gene expression across tissues, there remains a gap in our
          knowledge regarding the integration of functional genomics and GWAS
          data to identify tissue- and cell lineage-specific transcriptional
          mechanisms. This manuscript aims to bridge this gap by employing a
          novel approach to analyze gene expression patterns and identify
          genetic associations. By integrating functional genomics data and GWAS
          data, we will uncover novel regulatory elements and elucidate how
          their dysregulation contributes to tissue- and cell lineage-specific
          pathology. These findings will advance our understanding of complex
          traits and pave the way for the development of improved treatments.

          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          paragraph from the introduction of this manuscript so that it has a
          clear sentence structure, fits in a single paragraph, and keeps most
          references to papers (e.g. [@doi:...]). At a high level, the revision
          should highlight a gap in existing knowledge or methods, convey why it
          matters, and suggest how the manuscript aims to fill it. It may cover
          relevant literature to explain current knowledge, but only so far as
          is relevant to the motivation of the manuscript. It may be somewhat
          specific about results, relative to a typical high-level abstract
          section for example. More specifically, the revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          Sure, here's the revised paragraph:


          The complex nature of genetic regulation underlying complex traits
          necessitates a mechanistic understanding of gene expression patterns
          across different cell types. Previous studies have described various
          regulatory DNA elements and genetic effects on gene expression across
          different tissues, but these studies have been limited by the lack of
          comprehensive functional genomics data and the integration of GWAS
          data with functional genomics data. To address this gap, this
          manuscript aims to elucidate the genetic associations underlying
          complex traits by integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data.
          Through this approach, we will identify tissue- and cell
          lineage-specific transcriptional mechanisms that, when dysregulated,
          commonly result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology. This
          work will provide new insights into the etiology and potential
          treatment of complex diseases.

          Genes function in context-specific networks to carry out diverse

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          paragraph from the introduction of this manuscript so that it has a
          clear sentence structure, fits in a single paragraph, and keeps most
          references to papers (e.g. [@doi:...]). At a high level, the revision
          should highlight a gap in existing knowledge or methods, convey why it
          matters, and suggest how the manuscript aims to fill it. It may cover
          relevant literature to explain current knowledge, but only so far as
          is relevant to the motivation of the manuscript. It may be somewhat
          specific about results, relative to a typical high-level abstract
          section for example. More specifically, the revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          Genetic studies have revealed intricate gene expression patterns that
          underlie complex traits. These patterns involve the coordinated
          activity of genes in context-specific networks, which vary across
          different cell types. Variations in genes within these networks can
          significantly alter their functional roles and influence
          disease-related biological processes. To understand how genes
          influence complex traits, it is crucial to elucidate the mechanisms
          underlying gene expression regulation across various cell types.
          Although previous studies have described regulatory DNA elements and
          integrated functional genomics and GWAS data, there remains a gap in
          knowledge regarding the specific mechanisms that lead to tissue- and
          cell lineage-specific pathology. This manuscript aims to fill this gap
          by comprehensively profiling gene expression across multiple cell
          types and elucidating the molecular networks that govern these
          patterns. By integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data, this
          research will provide new insights into the complex interplay between
          genetic variation and tissue-specific regulation of gene expression,
          ultimately leading to improved treatments for complex diseases.

          Sure, here is the revised paragraph:


          The intricate interplay of genes in context-specific networks
          orchestrates diverse cellular functions. Variations in these genes can
          alter their functional roles, influencing disease-related biological
          processes. To elucidate how genes orchestrate complex traits, a
          mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different
          cell types is pivotal. This necessitates a deep appreciation of the
          complex interplay between genetic variation, regulatory DNA elements,
          and tissue-specific expression patterns. Previous studies have
          unveiled the intricate regulatory landscape, including genetic effects
          on gene expression across diverse tissues. Integrating functional
          genomics data and GWAS data has further enhanced the identification of
          transcriptional mechanisms that, when aberrant, lead to tissue- and
          cell lineage-specific pathology. These findings pave the way for novel
          therapeutic strategies by illuminating the complex relationship
          between genetic variation and tissue-specific expression regulation.

          paragraph from the introduction of this manuscript so that it has a
          clear sentence structure, fits in a single paragraph, and keeps most
          references to papers (e.g. [@doi:...]). At a high level, the revision
          should highlight a gap in existing knowledge or methods, convey why it
          matters, and suggest how the manuscript aims to fill it. It may cover
          relevant literature to explain current knowledge, but only so far as
          is relevant to the motivation of the manuscript. It may be somewhat
          specific about results, relative to a typical high-level abstract
          section for example. More specifically, the revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          The complex nature of genetic regulation underlying complex traits
          necessitates a mechanistic understanding of gene expression across
          different cell types. Previous studies have described regulatory DNA
          elements and genetic effects on gene expression across tissues, but
          the integration of functional genomics and GWAS data has substantially
          improved the identification of these mechanisms. These transcriptional
          mechanisms, when dysregulated, commonly result in tissue- and cell
          lineage-specific pathology. However, current approaches often fail to
          capture the context-specific regulatory networks that govern gene
          expression across diverse cell types. This manuscript aims to address
          this gap by characterizing context-specific gene expression patterns
          and integrating them with functional genomics data. By elucidating
          these mechanisms, this research will provide new insights into disease
          etiology and guide the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          paragraph from the introduction of this manuscript.


          Input paragraph: Genes work together in context-specific networks to
          carry out different functions [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259].
          Variations in these genes can change their functional role and, at a
          higher level, affect disease-relevant biological processes
          [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6]. In this context, determining how
          genes influence complex traits requires mechanistically understanding
          expression regulation across different cell types
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3;
          @doi:10.1038/s41576-019-0200-9], which in turn should lead to improved
          treatments [@doi:10.1038/ng.3314; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008489].
          Previous studies have described different regulatory DNA elements
          [@doi:10.1038/nature11247; @doi:10.1038/nature14248;
          @doi:10.1038/nature12787; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-03145-z;
          @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3] including genetic effects on gene
          expression across different tissues [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776].
          Integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data
          [@doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0081-4; @doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.04.002;
          @doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0081-4; @doi:10.1038/ncomms6890] has improved
          the identification of these transcriptional mechanisms that, when
          dysregulated, commonly result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific
          pathology [@pmid:20624743; @pmid:14707169;
          @doi:10.1073/pnas.0810772105].

          Sure, here is the revised paragraph:


          Genes cooperate in context-specific networks to carry out diverse
          functions. Variations in these genes can alter their functional roles
          and, at a higher level, affect disease-relevant biological processes.
          To understand how genes influence complex traits, it is crucial to
          mechanistically dissect expression regulation across different cell
          types, which ultimately leads to improved treatments. Previous studies
          have described various regulatory DNA elements, including genetic
          effects on gene expression across different tissues. Integrating
          functional genomics data and GWAS data has further enhanced the
          identification of these transcriptional mechanisms that, when
          dysregulated, commonly result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific
          pathology.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          paragraph from the introduction of this manuscript so that it has a
          clear sentence structure, fits in a single paragraph, and keeps most
          references to papers (e.g. [@doi:...]). At a high level, the revision
          should highlight a gap in existing knowledge or methods, convey why it
          matters, and suggest how the manuscript aims to fill it. It may cover
          relevant literature to explain current knowledge, but only so far as
          is relevant to the motivation of the manuscript. It may be somewhat
          specific about results, relative to a typical high-level abstract
          section for example. More specifically, the revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          Sure, here is the revised paragraph with improved structure,
          conciseness, and adherence to the C-C-C scheme:


          The complex interplay of genes in context-specific networks drives
          various biological functions. Variations in these genes can alter
          their functional roles and impact disease-related processes. To
          unravel how genes influence complex traits, a mechanistic
          understanding of expression regulation across different cell types is
          crucial. However, previous studies have primarily focused on
          regulatory DNA elements and genetic effects on gene expression across
          different tissues, leaving a gap in our understanding of the interplay
          between these factors and their impact on complex traits. This
          manuscript aims to bridge this gap by integrating functional genomics
          and GWAS data to elucidate the transcriptional mechanisms underlying
          tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology. By understanding these
          mechanisms, we can pave the way for improved treatments targeting
          specific cell types and tissues.

          Sure, here is the revised paragraph from the introduction of the
          manuscript:


          Gene expression patterns serve as a powerful tool for understanding
          complex biological processes and disease etiology. Genes interact in
          context-specific networks to carry out specific functions, and
          variations in these genes can alter their roles and affect
          disease-related biological processes. To decipher how genes influence
          complex traits, it is crucial to elucidate the mechanisms underlying
          gene expression regulation across different cell types. This
          understanding has the potential to lead to improved treatments.
          Previous studies have identified regulatory DNA elements and genetic
          effects on gene expression across different tissues. Integrating
          functional genomics data and GWAS data has further enhanced the
          identification of these transcriptional mechanisms. When dysregulated,
          these mechanisms commonly result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific
          pathology.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          paragraph from the introduction of this manuscript so that it has a
          clear sentence structure, fits in a single paragraph, and keeps most
          references to papers (e.g. [@doi:...]). At a high level, the revision
          should highlight a gap in existing knowledge or methods, convey why it
          matters, and suggest how the manuscript aims to fill it. It may cover
          relevant literature to explain current knowledge, but only so far as
          is relevant to the motivation of the manuscript. It may be somewhat
          specific about results, relative to a typical high-level abstract
          section for example. More specifically, the revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          Sure, here is the revised paragraph:


          The complex regulation of gene expression plays a pivotal role in
          shaping biological processes and disease states. Genes function in
          context-specific networks to carry out diverse functions, and
          variations in these genes can alter their roles and impact
          disease-related biological processes. To understand how genes
          influence complex traits, it is crucial to mechanistically dissect
          expression regulation across different cell types. Previous studies
          have described regulatory DNA elements and genetic effects on gene
          expression across tissues, but there remains a gap in our
          understanding of the interplay between these factors and their impact
          on complex traits. This manuscript aims to address this gap by
          integrating functional genomics and GWAS data to elucidate the
          transcriptional mechanisms that govern complex traits in specific cell
          lineages. By understanding these mechanisms, we can develop novel
          treatments that target tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology.

          Sure, here is the revised paragraph:


          Genes function in context-specific networks to carry out diverse
          functions. Variations in these genes can alter their functional roles
          and, at a higher level, affect disease-related biological processes.
          To understand how genes influence complex traits, it is crucial to
          mechanistically elucidate expression regulation across different cell
          types, which ultimately leads to improved treatments. Previous studies
          have described various regulatory DNA elements and genetic effects on
          gene expression across different tissues. Integrating functional
          genomics data and GWAS data has enhanced the identification of
          transcriptional mechanisms that, when dysregulated, commonly result in
          tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
          improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
          paragraph from the introduction of this manuscript so that it has a
          clear sentence structure, fits in a single paragraph, and keeps most
          references to papers (e.g. [@doi:...]). At a high level, the revision
          should highlight a gap in existing knowledge or methods, convey why it
          matters, and suggest how the manuscript aims to fill it. It may cover
          relevant literature to explain current knowledge, but only so far as
          is relevant to the motivation of the manuscript. It may be somewhat
          specific about results, relative to a typical high-level abstract
          section for example. More specifically, the revision should follow a
          context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The context
          portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will fill. The
          first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
          which the manuscript's research is situated. Then, the context is
          narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research
          answers. A successful context section distinguishes the research’s
          contributions from the current state-of-the-art, communicating what is
          missing in the current literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why
          that matters (i.e. the connection between the specific gap and the
          broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g. "here we") first
          describes the novel method or approach that was used to fill the gap,
          then presents an executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion
          portion interprets the results to answer the question that was posed
          at the end of the context portion. There may be a second part to the
          conclusion portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the
          broader field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

          The complex regulation of gene expression plays a pivotal role in
          shaping biological processes and dictating the development of various
          diseases. To understand the intricate interplay between genes and
          complex traits, it is crucial to elucidate the mechanisms underlying
          gene expression regulation across different cell types. While previous
          studies have identified genetic elements influencing gene expression,
          a gap persists in our understanding of how these elements translate
          into tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology. This manuscript aims
          to address this gap by integrating functional genomics data and GWAS
          data to uncover novel transcriptional mechanisms that are commonly
          dysregulated in various diseases. By characterizing these mechanisms,
          we can pave the way for the development of personalized treatments
          tailored to specific cell types and tissues.

            You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
            improving the text of a manuscript with title '{{ title }}' and
            keywords '{{ keywords }}.' Revise the following paragraph from the
            introduction of this manuscript so that it has a clear sentence
            structure, fits in a single paragraph, and keeps most references to
            papers (e.g. [@doi:...]). At a high level, the revision should
            highlight a gap in existing knowledge or methods, convey why it
            matters, and suggest how the manuscript aims to fill it. It may
            cover relevant literature to explain current knowledge, but only so
            far as is relevant to the motivation of the manuscript. It may be
            somewhat specific about results, relative to a typical high-level
            abstract section for example. More specifically, the revision should
            follow a context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1)
            The context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper
            will fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
            broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated. Then,
            the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the
            research answers. A successful context section distinguishes the
            research’s contributions from the current state-of-the-art,
            communicating what is missing in the current literature (i.e., the
            specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the connection between the
            specific gap and the broader context). 2) The content portion (e.g.
            "here we") first describes the novel method or approach that was
            used to fill the gap, then presents an executive summary of results.
            3) The conclusion portion interprets the results to answer the
            question that was posed at the end of the context portion. There may
            be a second part to the conclusion portion that highlights how this
            conclusion moves the broader field forward (e.g. "broader
            significance").

              Sure, here is the revised paragraph:


              Genes function in context-specific networks to carry out diverse
              functions. Variations in these genes can alter their functional
              roles and, at a higher level, affect disease-related biological
              processes. To understand complex traits, it is crucial to
              mechanistically dissect gene expression regulation across
              different cell types, as this knowledge can lead to improved
              treatments. Previous studies have described various regulatory DNA
              elements and their genetic effects on gene expression across
              different tissues. Integrating functional genomics data and GWAS
              data has significantly improved the identification of these
              transcriptional mechanisms, which, when dysregulated, commonly
              result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology.

              The existing literature describes various genetic elements and
              their impact on gene expression across different tissues. However,
              understanding the complex relationship between genetic variations
              and their functional consequences in disease remains a significant
              challenge. This is because tissue- and cell lineage-specific
              regulation of gene expression, which is key to understanding
              complex traits, has been poorly characterized. Previous studies
              have identified regulatory DNA elements and their genetic effects
              on gene expression across different tissues. However, integrating
              functional genomics data and GWAS data has been limited. To
              address this gap, this manuscript proposes a novel approach to
              project genetic associations through gene expression patterns.
              This approach will elucidate the mechanisms underlying tissue- and
              cell lineage-specific regulation of gene expression and provide

              most references to papers (e.g. [@doi:...]). At a high level, the
              revision should highlight a gap in existing knowledge or methods,
              convey why it matters, and suggest how the manuscript aims to fill
              it. It may cover relevant literature to explain current knowledge,
              but only so far as is relevant to the motivation of the
              manuscript. It may be somewhat specific about results, relative to
              a typical high-level abstract section for example. More
              specifically, the revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              Sure, here is the revised paragraph:


              Genetic regulation of gene expression plays a pivotal role in
              shaping complex traits. Genes function in context-specific
              networks, and variations in these genes can alter their functional
              roles and influence disease-related biological processes. To
              understand how genes influence complex traits, it is crucial to
              mechanistically dissect the regulation of gene expression across
              different cell types. Previous studies have identified regulatory
              DNA elements and genetic effects on gene expression across
              tissues. However, integrating functional genomics data and GWAS
              data has significantly improved the identification of these
              transcriptional mechanisms. These mechanisms, when dysregulated,
              commonly result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology.
              This manuscript aims to address this gap by exploring the
              relationship between gene expression patterns and complex traits.
              By characterizing the genetic associations underlying complex
              traits, we can pave the way for improved treatments and
              personalized medicine.

              Sure, here is the revised paragraph:


              The complex interplay of genes in context-specific networks
              orchestrates a vast array of biological functions. Variations in
              these genes can alter their functional roles, influencing
              disease-related biological processes. To decipher the intricate
              mechanisms underlying complex traits, a deep understanding of gene
              expression regulation across different cell types is paramount.
              While previous studies have shed light on regulatory DNA elements
              and genetic effects on gene expression, a key gap remains in our
              understanding of how these mechanisms contribute to tissue- and
              cell lineage-specific pathology. This manuscript aims to bridge
              this gap by integrating functional genomics and GWAS data to
              uncover transcriptional mechanisms that are commonly dysregulated
              in various diseases. By elucidating these mechanisms, this
              research paves the way for the development of novel therapies
              tailored to specific cell types and tissues.

              paragraph from the introduction of this manuscript so that it has
              a clear sentence structure, fits in a single paragraph, and keeps
              most references to papers (e.g. [@doi:...]). At a high level, the
              revision should highlight a gap in existing knowledge or methods,
              convey why it matters, and suggest how the manuscript aims to fill
              it. It may cover relevant literature to explain current knowledge,
              but only so far as is relevant to the motivation of the
              manuscript. It may be somewhat specific about results, relative to
              a typical high-level abstract section for example. More
              specifically, the revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              The complex regulation of gene expression plays a pivotal role in
              orchestrating various cellular functions. Variations in genes that
              encode regulators of these processes can lead to altered
              functional roles and impact disease-related biological pathways.
              To elucidate how genes influence complex traits, a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different cell types
              is crucial. Despite previous studies describing regulatory DNA
              elements and their impact on gene expression across tissues, there
              remains a gap in our knowledge regarding the integration of
              functional genomics and GWAS data to identify tissue- and cell
              lineage-specific transcriptional mechanisms. This manuscript aims
              to bridge this gap by employing a novel approach to analyze gene
              expression patterns and identify genetic associations. By
              integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data, we will
              uncover novel regulatory elements and elucidate how their
              dysregulation contributes to tissue- and cell lineage-specific

              a clear sentence structure, fits in a single paragraph, and keeps
              most references to papers (e.g. [@doi:...]). At a high level, the
              revision should highlight a gap in existing knowledge or methods,
              convey why it matters, and suggest how the manuscript aims to fill
              it. It may cover relevant literature to explain current knowledge,
              but only so far as is relevant to the motivation of the
              manuscript. It may be somewhat specific about results, relative to
              a typical high-level abstract section for example. More
              specifically, the revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              Sure, here's the revised paragraph:


              The complex nature of genetic regulation underlying complex traits
              necessitates a mechanistic understanding of gene expression
              patterns across different cell types. Previous studies have
              described various regulatory DNA elements and genetic effects on
              gene expression across different tissues, but these studies have
              been limited by the lack of comprehensive functional genomics data
              and the integration of GWAS data with functional genomics data. To
              address this gap, this manuscript aims to elucidate the genetic
              associations underlying complex traits by integrating functional
              genomics data and GWAS data. Through this approach, we will
              identify tissue- and cell lineage-specific transcriptional
              mechanisms that, when dysregulated, commonly result in tissue- and
              cell lineage-specific pathology. This work will provide new
              insights into the etiology and potential treatment of complex
              diseases.

              Genes function in context-specific networks to carry out diverse
              functions. Variations in these genes can alter their functional
              roles and, at a higher level, affect disease-relevant biological
              processes. To elucidate how genes influence complex traits, it is
              crucial to mechanistically understand expression regulation across
              different cell types, which has the potential to lead to improved
              treatments. Previous studies have described various regulatory DNA
              elements and genetic effects on gene expression across different
              tissues. Integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data has
              further enhanced the identification of these transcriptional
              mechanisms, which, when dysregulated, commonly result in tissue-
              and cell lineage-specific pathology.

              Sure, here is the revised paragraph with a clear sentence
              structure, a single paragraph, and most references to papers
              included:


              Genetic studies have revealed intricate gene expression patterns
              that underlie complex traits. These patterns involve the
              coordinated activity of genes in context-specific networks, which
              vary across different cell types. Variations in genes within these
              networks can significantly alter their functional roles and
              influence disease-related biological processes. To understand how
              genes influence complex traits, it is crucial to elucidate the
              mechanisms underlying gene expression regulation across various
              cell types. Although previous studies have described regulatory
              DNA elements and integrated functional genomics and GWAS data,
              there remains a gap in knowledge regarding the specific mechanisms
              that lead to tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology. This
              manuscript aims to fill this gap by comprehensively profiling gene
              expression across multiple cell types and elucidating the
              molecular networks that govern these patterns. By integrating
              functional genomics data and GWAS data, this research will provide
              new insights into the complex interplay between genetic variation
              and tissue-specific regulation of gene expression, ultimately
              leading to improved treatments for complex diseases.

              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
              paragraph from the introduction of this manuscript so that it has
              a clear sentence structure, fits in a single paragraph, and keeps
              most references to papers (e.g. [@doi:...]). At a high level, the
              revision should highlight a gap in existing knowledge or methods,
              convey why it matters, and suggest how the manuscript aims to fill
              it. It may cover relevant literature to explain current knowledge,
              but only so far as is relevant to the motivation of the
              manuscript. It may be somewhat specific about results, relative to
              a typical high-level abstract section for example. More
              specifically, the revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              The intricate interplay of genes in context-specific networks
              orchestrates diverse cellular functions. Variations in these genes
              can alter their functional roles, influencing disease-related
              biological processes. To elucidate how genes orchestrate complex
              traits, a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation
              across different cell types is pivotal. This necessitates a deep
              appreciation of the complex interplay between genetic variation,
              regulatory DNA elements, and tissue-specific expression patterns.
              Previous studies have unveiled the intricate regulatory landscape,
              including genetic effects on gene expression across diverse
              tissues. Integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data has
              further enhanced the identification of transcriptional mechanisms
              that, when aberrant, lead to tissue- and cell lineage-specific
              pathology. These findings pave the way for novel therapeutic
              strategies by illuminating the complex relationship between
              genetic variation and tissue-specific expression regulation.

              Sure, here is the revised paragraph:


              The complex nature of genetic regulation underlying complex traits
              necessitates a mechanistic understanding of gene expression across
              different cell types. Previous studies have described regulatory
              DNA elements and genetic effects on gene expression across
              tissues, but the integration of functional genomics and GWAS data
              has substantially improved the identification of these mechanisms.
              These transcriptional mechanisms, when dysregulated, commonly
              result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology. However,
              current approaches often fail to capture the context-specific
              regulatory networks that govern gene expression across diverse
              cell types. This manuscript aims to address this gap by
              characterizing context-specific gene expression patterns and
              integrating them with functional genomics data. By elucidating
              these mechanisms, this research will provide new insights into
              disease etiology and guide the development of novel therapeutic
              strategies.

              paragraph from the introduction of this manuscript so that it has
              a clear sentence structure, fits in a single paragraph, and keeps
              most references to papers (e.g. [@doi:...]). At a high level, the
              revision should highlight a gap in existing knowledge or methods,
              convey why it matters, and suggest how the manuscript aims to fill
              it. It may cover relevant literature to explain current knowledge,
              but only so far as is relevant to the motivation of the
              manuscript. It may be somewhat specific about results, relative to
              a typical high-level abstract section for example. More
              specifically, the revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              Sure, here is the revised paragraph:


              Genes cooperate in context-specific networks to carry out diverse
              functions. Variations in these genes can alter their functional
              roles and, at a higher level, affect disease-relevant biological
              processes. To understand how genes influence complex traits, it is
              crucial to mechanistically dissect expression regulation across
              different cell types, which ultimately leads to improved
              treatments. Previous studies have described various regulatory DNA
              elements, including genetic effects on gene expression across
              different tissues. Integrating functional genomics data and GWAS
              data has further enhanced the identification of these
              transcriptional mechanisms that, when dysregulated, commonly
              result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology.

              Sure, here is the revised paragraph with improved structure,
              conciseness, and adherence to the C-C-C scheme:


              The complex interplay of genes in context-specific networks drives
              various biological functions. Variations in these genes can alter
              their functional roles and impact disease-related processes. To
              unravel how genes influence complex traits, a mechanistic
              understanding of expression regulation across different cell types
              is crucial. However, previous studies have primarily focused on
              regulatory DNA elements and genetic effects on gene expression
              across different tissues, leaving a gap in our understanding of
              the interplay between these factors and their impact on complex
              traits. This manuscript aims to bridge this gap by integrating
              functional genomics and GWAS data to elucidate the transcriptional
              mechanisms underlying tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology.
              By understanding these mechanisms, we can pave the way for
              improved treatments targeting specific cell types and tissues.

              paragraph from the introduction of this manuscript so that it has
              a clear sentence structure, fits in a single paragraph, and keeps
              most references to papers (e.g. [@doi:...]). At a high level, the
              revision should highlight a gap in existing knowledge or methods,
              convey why it matters, and suggest how the manuscript aims to fill
              it. It may cover relevant literature to explain current knowledge,
              but only so far as is relevant to the motivation of the
              manuscript. It may be somewhat specific about results, relative to
              a typical high-level abstract section for example. More
              specifically, the revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              Sure, here is the revised paragraph from the introduction of the
              manuscript:


              Gene expression patterns serve as a powerful tool for
              understanding complex biological processes and disease etiology.
              Genes interact in context-specific networks to carry out specific
              functions, and variations in these genes can alter their roles and
              affect disease-related biological processes. To decipher how genes
              influence complex traits, it is crucial to elucidate the
              mechanisms underlying gene expression regulation across different
              cell types. This understanding has the potential to lead to
              improved treatments. Previous studies have identified regulatory
              DNA elements and genetic effects on gene expression across
              different tissues. Integrating functional genomics data and GWAS
              data has further enhanced the identification of these
              transcriptional mechanisms. When dysregulated, these mechanisms

              Sure, here is the revised paragraph:


              The complex regulation of gene expression plays a pivotal role in
              shaping biological processes and disease states. Genes function in
              context-specific networks to carry out diverse functions, and
              variations in these genes can alter their roles and impact
              disease-related biological processes. To understand how genes
              influence complex traits, it is crucial to mechanistically dissect
              expression regulation across different cell types. Previous
              studies have described regulatory DNA elements and genetic effects
              on gene expression across tissues, but there remains a gap in our
              understanding of the interplay between these factors and their
              impact on complex traits. This manuscript aims to address this gap
              by integrating functional genomics and GWAS data to elucidate the
              transcriptional mechanisms that govern complex traits in specific
              cell lineages. By understanding these mechanisms, we can develop
              novel treatments that target tissue- and cell lineage-specific
              pathology.

              paragraph from the introduction of this manuscript so that it has
              a clear sentence structure, fits in a single paragraph, and keeps
              most references to papers (e.g. [@doi:...]). At a high level, the
              revision should highlight a gap in existing knowledge or methods,
              convey why it matters, and suggest how the manuscript aims to fill
              it. It may cover relevant literature to explain current knowledge,
              but only so far as is relevant to the motivation of the
              manuscript. It may be somewhat specific about results, relative to
              a typical high-level abstract section for example. More
              specifically, the revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").

              Sure, here's the revised paragraph:


              The complex regulation of gene expression plays a pivotal role in
              shaping biological processes and dictating the development of
              various diseases. To understand the intricate interplay between
              genes and complex traits, it is crucial to elucidate the
              mechanisms underlying gene expression regulation across different
              cell types. While previous studies have identified genetic
              elements influencing gene expression, a gap persists in our
              understanding of how these elements translate into tissue- and
              cell lineage-specific pathology. This manuscript aims to address
              this gap by integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data to
              uncover novel transcriptional mechanisms that are commonly
              dysregulated in various diseases. By characterizing these
              mechanisms, we can pave the way for the development of
              personalized treatments tailored to specific cell types and
              tissues.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills who will help in
              improving the text of a manuscript with title 'Projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms' and keywords 'genetic studies,
              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Revise the following
              paragraph from the introduction of this manuscript so that it has
              a clear sentence structure, fits in a single paragraph, and keeps
              most references to papers (e.g. [@doi:...]). At a high level, the
              revision should highlight a gap in existing knowledge or methods,
              convey why it matters, and suggest how the manuscript aims to fill
              it. It may cover relevant literature to explain current knowledge,
              but only so far as is relevant to the motivation of the
              manuscript. It may be somewhat specific about results, relative to
              a typical high-level abstract section for example. More
              specifically, the revision should follow a
              context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme, as follows: 1) The
              context portion communicates to the reader what gap the paper will
              fill. The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the
              broader field in which the manuscript's research is situated.
              Then, the context is narrowed until it lands on the open question
              that the research answers. A successful context section
              distinguishes the research’s contributions from the current
              state-of-the-art, communicating what is missing in the current
              literature (i.e., the specific gap) and why that matters (i.e. the
              connection between the specific gap and the broader context). 2)
              The content portion (e.g. "here we") first describes the novel
              method or approach that was used to fill the gap, then presents an
              executive summary of results. 3) The conclusion portion interprets
              the results to answer the question that was posed at the end of
              the context portion. There may be a second part to the conclusion
              portion that highlights how this conclusion moves the broader
              field forward (e.g. "broader significance").
