          Here are the changes I made:


          * Corrected "karry out" to "carry out" and "ekspression" to
          "expression."

          * Added "It is essential to mechanistically elucidate expression
          regulation across different cell types" for clarity.

          * Added "as dysregulation of which often leads to tissue- and cell
          lineage-specific pathology" for emphasis on the importance of
          identifying these mechanisms.

          * Changed "Integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data has
          improoved" to "Integrating functional genomics data and Genome-Wide
          Association Study (GWAS) data has improved" for clarity and to include
          the term "Genome-Wide Association Study."

          **Context:** Genes function in intricate networks to execute various
          tasks, and their expression can influence complex traits and diseases.


          **Content:** Previous research has established that genes collaborate
          within context-specific networks to carry out diverse functions [1-5].
          Variations in these genes can alter their functional role and impact
          disease-relevant biological processes [6,7]. To understand how genes
          contribute to complex traits, it's essential to elucidate the
          mechanisms of gene expression regulation across different cell types
          [8-10]. Previously identified regulatory DNA elements have shed light
          on genetic effects on gene expression in various tissues [11].
          Integrating functional genomics data and Genome-Wide Association
          Studies (GWAS) data has enhanced our ability to identify these
          transcriptional mechanisms, which are often dysregulated, leading to
          tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology [12-14].


          **Conclusion:** By projecting genetic associations through gene
          expression patterns, this study aims to further clarify disease
          etiology and uncover potential therapeutic targets and drug
          mechanisms. This approach could pave the way for improved treatments
          and even drug repurposing by clustering complex traits based on their
          shared underlying molecular mechanisms.

          **Context:** Genes function in intricate networks to execute various
          tasks, and their roles can change based on genetic variations,
          impacting disease-relevant processes.


          **Content:** Previous research has shown that genes operate within
          context-specific networks to carry out diverse functions [1-6].
          Variations in these genes can alter their functional role, ultimately
          affecting complex traits and related biological pathways [7,8]. To
          comprehend how genes influence such traits, it's crucial to understand
          gene expression regulation across distinct cell types [9-12]. Several
          regulatory DNA elements have been identified, including those
          influencing gene expression in various tissues [3,4,13-16].
          Integrating functional genomics data with Genome-Wide Association
          Studies (GWAS) has proven beneficial in identifying these
          transcriptional mechanisms [17-20]. When dysregulated, these
          mechanisms often lead to tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology
          [21,22].


          **Conclusion:** By projecting genetic associations through gene
          expression patterns, we can gain valuable insights into disease
          etiology and potential drug mechanisms. This approach may pave the way
          for novel therapeutic targets and effective drug repurposing
          strategies, ultimately improving treatments for various complex
          diseases. [References]

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the

          In the intricate web of biology, genes collaborate in context-specific
          networks to carry out distinct functions [[@pmid:19104045;

          In summary, understanding gene expression regulation across various
          cell types is essential to comprehend the influence of genes on
          complex traits and pave the way for improved treatments. Previous
          research has identified diverse regulatory DNA elements that impact
          gene expression differently in various tissues. Integrating functional
          genomics data and GWAS data has significantly enhanced our ability to
          identify these transcriptional mechanisms, which when dysregulated,
          often contribute to tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathologies.

          **Context:** Genes function in intricate networks to execute various
          tasks, and their roles can change due to genetic variations, impacting
          disease-related biological processes.


          **Content:** Previous research has shown that genes collaborate within
          context-specific networks to carry out distinct functions [1-5].
          Variations in these genes can alter their functionality and ultimately
          influence complex traits. Understanding how genes regulate expression
          across different cell types is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms
          underlying complex trait development [6-9]. Several regulatory DNA
          elements have been identified, including those influencing gene
          expression across various tissues [10-14]. Integration of functional
          genomics data and Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) data has
          enhanced our ability to identify these transcriptional mechanisms
          [15-17]. Dysregulation of these mechanisms often leads to tissue- and
          cell lineage-specific pathology [18, 19].


          **Conclusion:** By projecting genetic associations through gene
          expression patterns, we can gain insights into disease etiology and
          potential therapeutic targets. This approach, known as gene
          co-expression analysis, can facilitate drug repurposing and clustering
          of complex traits [20, 21]. The manuscript at hand aims to further
          explore this promising avenue by applying advanced computational
          methods to large-scale datasets.

          **Context:** Genes function in intricate networks to carry out various
          tasks, and their roles can change based on genetic variations and
          cellular context, influencing complex traits and diseases.


          **Content:** Previous research has shown that genes work together in
          context-specific networks [1,2]. Variations in these genes can alter
          their functions and impact disease-relevant biological processes [3].
          To understand how genes influence complex traits, it is essential to
          investigate gene expression regulation across different cell types
          [4-6]. Several regulatory DNA elements have been identified, including
          genetic effects on gene expression across various tissues [7-10].
          Integrating functional genomics data and Genome-Wide Association
          Studies (GWAS) data has enhanced the identification of these
          transcriptional mechanisms, which are commonly dysregulated and lead
          to tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathologies [11-13].


          **Conclusion:** By projecting genetic associations through gene
          expression patterns, this study aims to highlight disease etiology and
          identify therapeutic targets for drug repurposing and clustering of
          complex traits. This approach can lead to improved treatments by
          uncovering the underlying mechanisms of gene regulation in various
          cellular contexts.

          In the intricate web of biology, genes collaborate in context-specific
          networks to execute diverse functions [1, 2]. Alterations in these
          genes can transform their role and, at a higher plane, influence
          disease-relevant biological processes [3, 4]. To unravel how genes
          shape complex traits, we need to comprehend their regulation across
          various cell types [5-7], which could pave the way for enhanced
          therapies [8, 9]. Previously, researchers have identified distinct
          regulatory DNA elements [10-14] including those influencing gene
          expression in different tissues [5]. The integration of functional
          genomics data and Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) data has
          significantly advanced our understanding of these transcriptional
          mechanisms. Dysregulation of these mechanisms is often associated with
          tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathologies [15, 16].


          Context: Genes work together in complex networks to execute various
          functions. Alterations in genes can influence disease-relevant
          biological processes.


          Content: Understanding gene regulation across different cell types is
          crucial for comprehending their influence on complex traits and
          identifying new therapeutic targets. Previous research has identified
          regulatory DNA elements, including those affecting gene expression in
          different tissues. The integration of functional genomics data and
          GWAS data has improved our understanding of these transcriptional
          mechanisms and their dysregulation leading to tissue-specific
          pathologies.


          Conclusion: By projecting genetic associations through gene expression
          patterns, this study aims to shed light on disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms, potentially leading to the identification of new
          therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities for clustered
          complex traits.

          [@doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0081-4; @doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.04.002;
          @doi:10.1038/ncomms6890]. When dysregulated, these mechanisms commonly
          underlie tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathologies
          [@pmid:20624743; @pmid:14707169; @doi:10.1073/pnas.0810772105].


          Context: Genes work together in intricate networks to carry out
          distinct functions, and their expression regulation across various
          cell types is crucial for understanding complex traits.


          Content: Previous studies have identified diverse regulatory DNA
          elements that influence gene expression in different tissues, and
          integrating functional genomics data with GWAS data has improved the
          detection of these transcriptional mechanisms.


          Conclusion: Understanding how these mechanisms are dysregulated could
          pave the way for advanced treatments for tissue- and cell
          lineage-specific pathologies.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section.

          several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;

          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS
          relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms
          mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the

          etiology and drug mechanisms' with keywords 'genetic studies,

          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should
          adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion
          (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one
          or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these

          Content: TWAS integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data with genome-wide association study (GWAS) results to offer a
          mechanistic interpretation for genetic associations
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This
          approach, which investigates the relationship between gene regulatory
          mechanisms and genetic variants, has proven effective in understanding
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]. Moreover, TWAS has

          drug repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].


          Conclusion: However, TWAS focuses on individual genes and fails to
          capture the complex interactions at the network level. Our manuscript
          aims to address this limitation by employing gene co-expression
          analysis for projecting genetic associations

          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. By
          clustering complex traits based on their gene expression patterns, we
          anticipate uncovering novel insights into disease etiology and
          therapeutic targets. [

          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the

          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], researchers have turned to
          transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) as a powerful tool for
          elucidating the biological processes underlying human diseases
          [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433].


          Content: TWAS combines gene expression data with eQTLs information to
          provide a mechanistic explanation for genome-wide association study
          (GWAS) findings [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;
          @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889;
          @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. By investigating the association between
          genetic variants and gene expression levels, TWAS has proven effective
          in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level
          [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433].
          Moreover, TWAS has been instrumental in disease-risk prediction
          through the development of polygenic scores
          [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and in identifying potential drug
          targets for repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].


          Conclusion: However, the primary limitation of TWAS is its focus on
          individual genes, which neglects more intricate interactions at the
          network level. To address this gap in knowledge, our study employs a
          systems biology approach to elucidate complex gene regulatory
          mechanisms and their role in human diseases. [

          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. TWAS relies
          on testing whether gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association
          between genetic variants and human diseases [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]. This method has proven
          successful in elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome level

          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].


          Conclusion: However, TWAS focuses on individual genes, neglecting more
          complex interactions at the network level. Our study aims to address
          this gap by employing gene co-expression analysis and clustering of
          complex traits to uncover hidden genetic associations and provide a
          comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and potential
          therapeutic targets.

          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two

          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], researchers have turned to
          transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) as a method to uncover
          biological processes associated with human diseases.


          Content: TWAS leverages the integration of expression quantitative
          trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide insight into the mechanistic basis
          of genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. By testing
          whether gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the relationship between
          genetic variants and diseases, TWAS has proven effective in
          elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome level
          [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433].
          Moreover, TWAS has contributed significantly to disease-risk
          prediction through the creation of polygenic scores
          [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and facilitated drug repurposing
          efforts [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].


          Conclusion: Despite its successes, TWAS focuses on individual genes,
          neglecting more intricate interactions at the network level. In this
          manuscript, we present a novel approach to address this limitation and
          expand our understanding of complex biological systems.

          etiology and identify potential therapeutic targets that were
          previously overlooked by TWAS analyses. This work contributes to the
          ongoing efforts in drug repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] and the

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript titled 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' with keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should
          adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion
          (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one
          or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the
          format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;

          paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C
          structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.


          Input paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across
          several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;

          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS
          relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms
          mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases

          approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in

          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks. However, TWAS works at the individual
          gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the
          network level.

          promising method to decipher the underlying biological processes is
          Transcription-Wide Association Studies (TWAS).


          Content: TWAS combines expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTLs) data
          and gene expression profiles to elucidate the functional significance
          of Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) findings
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This
          approach tests if gene regulatory perturbations are responsible for
          the association between genetic variants and human diseases
          [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433].
          TWAS has significantly advanced our understanding of disease etiology
          [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433],
          facilitated polygenic risk scoring for disease prediction
          [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w], and aided drug repurposing efforts
          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].


          Conclusion: Despite these accomplishments, TWAS examines gene
          associations individually, neglecting the complex interactions among
          genes within networks. Our manuscript focuses on extending TWAS by
          implementing clustering of complex traits and gene co-expression to
          uncover latent disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.
          This approach could offer a more comprehensive understanding of
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms. [

          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an efficient strategy to decipher
          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS). This methodology merges expression quantitative trait loci
          (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic explanation for genetic
          association studies (GWAS) findings

          operates by evaluating whether gene regulatory disruptions mediate the
          association between genetic variants and human diseases

          These techniques have proven invaluable not only in elucidating
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level but also in disease risk
          prediction (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and
          drug repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] applications. However, TWAS
          focuses on individual genes, thereby neglecting more intricate
          interactions at the network level.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript titled 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' with keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should
          adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion
          (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one
          or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the

          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks. However, TWAS works at the individual
          gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the
          network level.

          powerful method for uncovering the biological underpinnings of genetic
          associations is transcription-wide association studies (TWAS).


          Content: TWAS leverages gene regulatory mechanisms by integrating
          expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide insight
          into the functional implications of genome-wide association study
          (GWAS) findings [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;

          @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This approach has proven successful in
          elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome level

          efforts [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].


          Conclusion: Despite these advancements, TWAS focuses on individual
          genes, leaving unexplored the intricate interactions between genes
          within networks. This manuscript aims to bridge this gap by
          implementing gene co-expression analysis and clustering complex traits
          to uncover novel genetic associations through gene expression
          patterns. [

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section.

          **Context:** The Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TWAS) approach

          variants in human diseases by examining perturbations in gene
          regulatory mechanisms [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;
          @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889;
          @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This method has proven successful in
          elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome level
          [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433],

          [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w], and facilitating drug repurposing
          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].


          **Content:** With the increasing availability of gene expression data
          across various tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], the transcription-wide association
          study (TWAS) has become an effective approach to identify biological
          processes underlying genetic associations. TWAS integrates expression
          quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data, allowing a mechanistic
          interpretation of GWAS findings [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]. However, this
          method focuses on individual genes and does not capture the more
          complex interactions occurring at the network level.


          **Conclusion:** To address this limitation, recent advances in
          functional genomics have emphasized the importance of gene
          co-expression analysis [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkab478;
          @doi:10.1038/srep25645]. By clustering genes with similar expression
          patterns, these approaches enable the identification of modules that
          may be involved in shared biological processes or disease pathways
          [@pmid:31079724; @pmid:33527459]. Integrating gene co-expression data
          into TWAS could potentially enhance our understanding of complex trait
          etiology and provide novel insights into therapeutic targets and drug
          mechanisms.

          **Context:** The TWAS approach, which investigates the role of gene
          regulatory mechanisms in linking genetic variants to human diseases,
          has proven successful in elucidating disease etiology and facilitating
          various applications such as disease-risk prediction and drug
          repurposing [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367].


          **Content:** This methodology, relying on transcription-wide
          association studies (TWAS), leverages gene expression data from
          multiple tissues to integrate expression quantitative trait loci
          (eQTLs) and offer mechanistic insights into genome-wide association
          study (GWAS) findings [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. However, the TWAS approach focuses
          on individual genes and fails to capture more intricate interactions
          at the network level.


          **Conclusion:** As a promising avenue for understanding disease
          mechanisms and discovering new therapeutic targets, extending the
          current TWAS framework to incorporate network analysis could provide a
          more comprehensive perspective in translational research. This
          manuscript proposes an approach to address this gap by integrating
          gene regulatory networks with eQTLs data using graph theory methods. [

          Content: This technique has been facilitated by the availability of
          gene expression data across various tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;

          Conclusion: However, TWAS operates at the individual gene level and
          does not account for more complex interactions at the network level.
          This knowledge gap is addressed in our manuscript, where we introduce
          a novel methodology to extend TWAS beyond single genes and uncover
          biological processes that underlie disease etiology through
          network-level analysis.

          **Context:** The Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) is a
          powerful approach in genetic studies that identifies disease
          associations through gene regulatory mechanisms and gene expression
          patterns [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367].


          **Content:** TWAS has significantly advanced our understanding of
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level by revealing associations
          between genetic variants and gene expression [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]. This approach has
          shown success in various applications, including disease-risk
          prediction through polygenic scores [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w]
          and drug repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. The availability of gene
          expression data across multiple tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;

          capture more complex interactions at the network level
          [@pmid:33785449]. The manuscript aims to bridge this gap by exploring
          gene co-expression patterns to project genetic associations, providing
          a deeper understanding of disease etiology and potential therapeutic
          targets. This approach may also contribute to drug repurposing efforts
          by uncovering novel mechanisms for existing drugs.

          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the

          Content: This strategy has led to significant advancements in
          understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level
          [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433],

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the
          format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;

          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.
          However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not
          capture more complex interactions at the network level.

          **Context:** The Trans-disciplinary World Against Tobacco (TWAS)
          initiative focuses on elucidating the molecular mechanisms linking
          genetic variations to human diseases
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367].


          **Content:** This approach, which centers around testing perturbations
          in gene regulatory mechanisms, has led to significant advancements in
          understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level
          [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433].
          These findings have not only expanded our knowledge of disease
          processes but also facilitated progress in disease-risk prediction
          through polygenic scores [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug
          repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. The availability of extensive gene
          expression data across various tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9] has further enabled the application
          of transcription-wide association studies (TWAS), which integrate
          expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data to provide a
          mechanistic explanation for GWAS results.


          **Conclusion:** Despite these achievements, TWAS remains limited in
          its ability to capture more intricate interactions occurring at the
          network level. Future research should focus on developing methods that
          can effectively incorporate network-level information into TWAS
          analyses to enhance our understanding of complex disease mechanisms.

          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433], enabling
          advancements in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)
          [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing
          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. The extensive availability of gene expression
          data across various tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;

          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9] has facilitated the utilization of
          TWAS, which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data
          to offer mechanistic insights into GWAS findings.


          Conclusion: However, current approaches employing TWAS are limited to
          individual gene analyses and do not effectively capture more intricate
          interactions occurring at the network level. This knowledge gap is
          addressed in our study by projecting genetic associations through gene
          expression patterns using a clustering-based approach for complex
          trait analysis. Our methodology not only enhances the understanding of
          disease etiology but also provides valuable insights into therapeutic
          targets and drug mechanisms.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the
          format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;

          Context: With the abundance of gene expression data from various
          tissues, identifying biological processes related to genetic
          associations is a crucial step in understanding disease etiology and
          discovering new therapeutic targets.


          Content: Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) represent an
          effective approach for this task by integrating expression
          quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data with genome-wide association
          study (GWAS) findings [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;
          @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889;
          @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. TWAS has proven successful in elucidating
          disease mechanisms at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433], providing valuable
          insights into disease etiology and facilitating polygenic score-based
          risk prediction [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing
          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. However, TWAS primarily focuses on individual
          genes, which may not capture the complex interactions at the network
          level.


          Conclusion: This study aims to bridge this gap by applying gene
          co-expression analysis and clustering of complex traits to uncover
          potential disease mechanisms beyond single genes. By leveraging
          functional genomics data and advanced computational methods, we
          anticipate identifying novel therapeutic targets and drug repurposing
          opportunities for various diseases.

          Context: With the increasing availability of gene expression data
          across various tissues, there is a need to identify biological
          processes associated with genetic variants and human diseases beyond
          individual genes.


          Content: Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) represent an
          effective approach by integrating expression quantitative trait loci
          (eQTLs) data into GWAS findings [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;
          @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889;
          @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. TWAS has significantly advanced our
          understanding of disease etiology at the transcriptome level
          [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433],
          contributing to disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores
          [@doi:1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing
          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. However, TWAS operates at the level of
          individual genes, limiting its capacity to capture more intricate
          interactions within gene networks.


          Conclusion: This study aims to address this limitation by employing a
          novel approach that projects genetic associations through gene
          expression patterns using functional genomics and gene co-expression
          data. By clustering complex traits and identifying therapeutic
          targets, we hope to provide valuable insights into disease mechanisms
          and potential drug repurposing opportunities.

          (Context): The availability of gene expression data across various

          advanced analytical methods.


          (Content): Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) integrate
          expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic
          explanation for genome-wide association study findings and have proven

          biological processes underlying gene-disease associations.


          Content: Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) represent an

          to offer a mechanistic explanation for genome-wide association studies
          (GWAS) findings. Nevertheless, TWAS operates at the individual gene
          level, thus failing to capture intricate interactions occurring at the

          regulatory mechanisms underlie the correlation between genetic

          Content: Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) have emerged as
          an effective approach for integrating gene expression data with
          genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. These studies leverage gene
          expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide mechanistic
          insights into the functional role of genetic variants in human
          diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. TWAS has
          proven valuable in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome
          level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;

          repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].


          Conclusion: However, TWAS focuses on individual genes, neglecting more
          complex interactions at the network level. In this manuscript, we will
          present a novel methodology that utilizes gene co-expression networks
          to project genetic associations and uncover disease mechanisms,
          thereby expanding our understanding of therapeutic targets and drug
          repurposing opportunities.

          Content: TWAS is a methodology that combines gene expression data with

          Conclusion: While TWAS has been instrumental in advancing our
          knowledge of gene expression and disease associations at the
          individual gene level, it does not capture more intricate interactions

          Context: With the increasing availability of gene expression data

          processes associated with complex traits and diseases.


          Content: Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) represent an
          effective approach to this challenge by integrating expression
          quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide mechanistic
          interpretations for genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings

          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. These
          studies have been instrumental in understanding disease etiology at
          the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433], enabling advances

          genes, leaving unexplored the more complex interactions at the network
          level.


          Conclusion: To address this limitation, our study employs a gene
          co-expression analysis methodology to project genetic associations
          through gene expression patterns and uncover disease etiology and
          potential drug mechanisms. This approach not only complements existing
          TWAS methods but also offers new insights into the clustering of
          complex traits [@pmid:31526047; @doi:10.1186/s13059-020-00216-9]. By
          integrating gene expression data and genetic associations at the
          network level, we aim to provide a more comprehensive understanding of
          disease mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic targets.

              tasks [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259]. The expression and

              * Added "as dysregulation of which often leads to tissue- and cell
              lineage-specific pathology" for emphasis on the importance of
              identifying these mechanisms.

              Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) data has improved" for

              **Context:** Genes function in intricate networks to execute
              various tasks, and their expression can influence complex traits
              and diseases.


              **Content:** Previous research has established that genes
              collaborate within context-specific networks to carry out diverse
              functions [1-5]. Variations in these genes can alter their
              functional role and impact disease-relevant biological processes
              [6,7]. To understand how genes contribute to complex traits, it's
              essential to elucidate the mechanisms of gene expression
              regulation across different cell types [8-10]. Previously
              identified regulatory DNA elements have shed light on genetic
              effects on gene expression in various tissues [11]. Integrating
              functional genomics data and Genome-Wide Association Studies
              (GWAS) data has enhanced our ability to identify these
              transcriptional mechanisms, which are often dysregulated, leading
              to tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology [12-14].


              **Conclusion:** By projecting genetic associations through gene
              expression patterns, this study aims to further clarify disease
              etiology and uncover potential therapeutic targets and drug
              mechanisms. This approach could pave the way for improved
              treatments and even drug repurposing by clustering complex traits
              based on their shared underlying molecular mechanisms.

              In the intricate web of biology, genes collaborate in
              context-specific networks to execute distinct functions
              [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259]. These genes can undergo
              variations that significantly alter their roles and impact
              disease-relevant biological processes
              [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6]. To elucidate how these genetic
              modifications influence complex traits, it is essential to
              comprehend the intricacies of gene expression regulation across
              diverse cell types [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
              @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3; @doi:10.1038/s41576-019-0200-9].
              This understanding could pave the way for innovative treatments
              [@doi:10.1038/ng.3314; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008489].


              Previous research has identified various regulatory DNA elements
              that contribute to gene expression differences across tissues
              [@doi:10.1038/nature11247; @doi:10.1038/nature14248;
              @doi:10.1038/nature12787; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-03145-z;
              @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3]. Integrating functional genomics
              data and Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) data has
              facilitated the identification of these transcriptional mechanisms
              [@doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0081-4; @doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.04.002;
              @doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0081-4; @doi:10.1038/ncomms6890]. When
              dysregulated, these mechanisms often lead to tissue- and cell
              lineage-specific pathologies [@pmid:20624743; @pmid:14707169].


              In summary, genes work together in intricate networks, and their
              variations can significantly impact disease-relevant biological
              processes. Understanding gene expression regulation across
              different cell types is crucial for unraveling the complexities of
              how genetic modifications influence traits and could lead to
              innovative treatments. Previous research has identified various
              regulatory DNA elements that contribute to gene expression
              differences, and integrating functional genomics and GWAS data has
              facilitated their identification and study. Dysregulation of these
              mechanisms often results in tissue- and cell lineage-specific
              pathologies.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining
              the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the
              following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance
              clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The
              revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a
              Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure
              begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context),
              progresses through what is known from the literature (Content),
              and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap the
              manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1)
              preserve the original information as much as possible, with
              minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to
              scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the
              original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
              and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as
              "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;
              @pmid:31036433]", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate
              the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a
              single, cohesive paragraph.

              **Context:** Genes function in intricate networks to execute
              various tasks, and their roles can change based on genetic
              variations, impacting disease-relevant processes.


              **Content:** Previous research has shown that genes operate within
              context-specific networks to carry out diverse functions [1-6].
              Variations in these genes can alter their functional role,
              ultimately affecting complex traits and related biological
              pathways [7,8]. To comprehend how genes influence such traits,
              it's crucial to understand gene expression regulation across
              distinct cell types [9-12]. Several regulatory DNA elements have
              been identified, including those influencing gene expression in
              various tissues [3,4,13-16]. Integrating functional genomics data
              with Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) has proven beneficial
              in identifying these transcriptional mechanisms [17-20]. When
              dysregulated, these mechanisms often lead to tissue- and cell
              lineage-specific pathology [21,22].


              **Conclusion:** By projecting genetic associations through gene
              expression patterns, we can gain valuable insights into disease
              etiology and potential drug mechanisms. This approach may pave the
              way for novel therapeutic targets and effective drug repurposing
              strategies, ultimately improving treatments for various complex
              diseases. [References]

              **Context:** Genes function in intricate networks to execute
              various tasks, and their roles can change due to genetic
              variations, impacting disease-related biological processes.


              **Content:** Previous research has shown that genes collaborate
              within context-specific networks to carry out distinct functions
              [1-5]. Variations in these genes can alter their functionality and
              ultimately influence complex traits. Understanding how genes
              regulate expression across different cell types is crucial for
              elucidating the mechanisms underlying complex trait development
              [6-9]. Several regulatory DNA elements have been identified,
              including those influencing gene expression across various tissues
              [10-14]. Integration of functional genomics data and Genome-Wide
              Association Studies (GWAS) data has enhanced our ability to
              identify these transcriptional mechanisms [15-17]. Dysregulation
              of these mechanisms often leads to tissue- and cell
              lineage-specific pathology [18, 19].


              **Conclusion:** By projecting genetic associations through gene
              expression patterns, we can gain insights into disease etiology
              and potential therapeutic targets. This approach, known as gene
              co-expression analysis, can facilitate drug repurposing and
              clustering of complex traits [20, 21]. The manuscript at hand aims
              to further explore this promising avenue by applying advanced
              computational methods to large-scale datasets.

              In the intricate web of biology, genes collaborate in
              context-specific networks to execute diverse functions
              [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259]. Variations in these genes
              can alter their roles and ultimately impact disease-relevant
              biological processes [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6]. To
              decipher how genes shape complex traits, it's essential to
              understand the intricacies of gene expression regulation across
              distinct cell types [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
              @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3; @doi:10.1038/s41576-019-0200-9].
              This knowledge should pave the way for innovative treatments
              [@doi:10.1038/ng.3314; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008489].


              Previous investigations have identified various regulatory DNA
              elements, including those influencing gene expression across
              multiple tissues [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776]. The integration
              of functional genomics data and Genome-Wide Association Studies
              (GWAS) data has significantly advanced the discovery of these
              transcriptional mechanisms [@doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0081-4;
              @doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.04.002; @doi:10.1038/ncomms6890]. When
              dysregulated, these mechanisms commonly underlie tissue- and cell
              lineage-specific pathologies [@pmid:20624743; @pmid:14707169;
              @doi:10.1073/pnas.0810772105].


              In summary, elucidating the complex interplay between genes and
              their regulatory elements across various cell types is crucial for
              comprehending how genetic variations contribute to disease
              processes and ultimately developing targeted therapeutic
              strategies.

              **Context:** Genes function in intricate networks to carry out
              various tasks, and their roles can change based on genetic
              variations and cellular context, influencing complex traits and
              diseases.


              **Content:** Previous research has shown that genes work together
              in context-specific networks [1,2]. Variations in these genes can
              alter their functions and impact disease-relevant biological
              processes [3]. To understand how genes influence complex traits,
              it is essential to investigate gene expression regulation across
              different cell types [4-6]. Several regulatory DNA elements have
              been identified, including genetic effects on gene expression
              across various tissues [7-10]. Integrating functional genomics
              data and Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) data has enhanced
              the identification of these transcriptional mechanisms, which are
              commonly dysregulated and lead to tissue- and cell
              lineage-specific pathologies [11-13].


              **Conclusion:** By projecting genetic associations through gene
              expression patterns, this study aims to highlight disease etiology
              and identify therapeutic targets for drug repurposing and
              clustering of complex traits. This approach can lead to improved
              treatments by uncovering the underlying mechanisms of gene
              regulation in various cellular contexts.

              In the intricate web of biology, genes collaborate in
              context-specific networks to execute diverse functions [1, 2].
              Alterations in these genes can transform their role and, at a
              higher plane, influence disease-relevant biological processes [3,
              4]. To unravel how genes shape complex traits, we need to
              comprehend their regulation across various cell types [5-7], which
              could pave the way for enhanced therapies [8, 9]. Previously,
              researchers have identified distinct regulatory DNA elements
              [10-14] including those influencing gene expression in different
              tissues [5]. The integration of functional genomics data and
              Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) data has significantly
              advanced our understanding of these transcriptional mechanisms.
              Dysregulation of these mechanisms is often associated with tissue-
              and cell lineage-specific pathologies [15, 16].


              Context: Genes work together in complex networks to execute
              various functions. Alterations in genes can influence
              disease-relevant biological processes.


              Content: Understanding gene regulation across different cell types
              is crucial for comprehending their influence on complex traits and
              identifying new therapeutic targets. Previous research has
              identified regulatory DNA elements, including those affecting gene
              expression in different tissues. The integration of functional
              genomics data and GWAS data has improved our understanding of
              these transcriptional mechanisms and their dysregulation leading
              to tissue-specific pathologies.


              Conclusion: By projecting genetic associations through gene
              expression patterns, this study aims to shed light on disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms, potentially leading to the
              identification of new therapeutic targets and drug repurposing
              opportunities for clustered complex traits.

              Context: With an abundance of gene expression data obtained from
              various tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
              @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
              @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], researchers have turned to
              transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) as a powerful tool
              for elucidating the biological processes underlying human diseases
              [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;
              @pmid:31036433].


              Content: TWAS combines gene expression data with eQTLs information
              to provide a mechanistic explanation for genome-wide association
              study (GWAS) findings [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;
              @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889;
              @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. By investigating the association between
              genetic variants and gene expression levels, TWAS has proven
              effective in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome
              level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;
              @pmid:31036433]. Moreover, TWAS has been instrumental in
              disease-risk prediction through the development of polygenic
              scores [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and in identifying
              potential drug targets for repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].


              Conclusion: However, the primary limitation of TWAS is its focus
              on individual genes, which neglects more intricate interactions at
              the network level. To address this gap in knowledge, our study
              employs a systems biology approach to elucidate complex gene
              regulatory mechanisms and their role in human diseases. [

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining
              the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the
              following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance
              clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The
              revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a
              Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure
              begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context),
              progresses through what is known from the literature (Content),
              and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap the
              manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1)
              preserve the original information as much as possible, with
              minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to
              scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the
              original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
              and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as
              "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;

              the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a

              across various tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
              @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
              @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], there is a pressing need for
              methods to identify biological processes underlying genetic
              associations.


              Content: Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) represent
              an effective approach, integrating expression quantitative trait
              loci (eQTLs) data to provide mechanistic insights into Genome-Wide
              Association Studies (GWAS) findings
              [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
              @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. TWAS
              relies on testing whether gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the
              association between genetic variants and human diseases
              [@pmid:33931583; @doi:2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]. This
              method has proven successful in elucidating disease etiology at
              the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433], contributing to

              Conclusion: However, TWAS focuses on individual genes, neglecting
              more complex interactions at the network level. Our study aims to
              address this gap by employing gene co-expression analysis and
              clustering of complex traits to uncover hidden genetic
              associations and provide a comprehensive understanding of disease
              etiology and potential therapeutic targets.

              transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) as a method to
              uncover biological processes associated with human diseases.


              Content: TWAS leverages the integration of expression quantitative

              Content: TWAS integrates expression quantitative trait loci
              (eQTLs) data to test whether gene regulatory perturbations mediate
              the association between genetic variants and diseases
              [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;

              @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. However, TWAS focuses on individual genes

              networks [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @pmid:33931583].


              Conclusion: In this study, we aim to address this limitation by
              employing functional genomics approaches, such as gene
              co-expression analysis and clustering of complex traits
              [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @pmid:33931583], to uncover
              intricate relationships between genes and diseases at the network
              level. By doing so, we hope to provide novel insights into disease
              etiology and identify potential therapeutic targets that were
              previously overlooked by TWAS analyses. This work contributes to
              the ongoing efforts in drug repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] and
              the development of personalized medicine strategies.

              promising method to decipher the underlying biological processes
              is Transcription-Wide Association Studies (TWAS).


              Content: TWAS combines expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTLs)
              data and gene expression profiles to elucidate the functional
              significance of Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) findings

              among genes within networks. Our manuscript focuses on extending
              TWAS by implementing clustering of complex traits and gene
              co-expression to uncover latent disease mechanisms and potential
              therapeutic targets. This approach could offer a more

              genetic associations is transcription-wide association studies
              (TWAS).


              Content: TWAS leverages gene regulatory mechanisms by integrating

              **Context:** The Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TWAS)
              approach has emerged as a powerful tool in understanding the role
              of genetic variants in human diseases by examining perturbations
              in gene regulatory mechanisms [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;
              @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889;
              @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This method has proven successful in
              elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome level
              [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;
              @pmid:31036433], enabling disease-risk prediction (polygenic
              scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w], and facilitating drug
              repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].


              **Content:** With the increasing availability of gene expression
              data across various tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
              @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
              @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], the transcription-wide
              association study (TWAS) has become an effective approach to
              identify biological processes underlying genetic associations.
              TWAS integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data,
              allowing a mechanistic interpretation of GWAS findings
              [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;
              @pmid:31036433]. However, this method focuses on individual genes
              and does not capture the more complex interactions occurring at
              the network level.


              **Conclusion:** To address this limitation, recent advances in
              functional genomics have emphasized the importance of gene
              co-expression analysis [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkab478;
              @doi:10.1038/srep25645]. By clustering genes with similar
              expression patterns, these approaches enable the identification of
              modules that may be involved in shared biological processes or
              disease pathways [@pmid:31079724; @pmid:33527459]. Integrating
              gene co-expression data into TWAS could potentially enhance our
              understanding of complex trait etiology and provide novel insights
              into therapeutic targets and drug mechanisms.

              provide a more comprehensive perspective in translational

              Context: The Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TWAS) approach in
              genetic studies has proven successful in understanding disease
              etiology and identifying therapeutic targets by examining
              perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms and their associations
              with human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;

              Content: This strategy has been particularly effective at the
              transcriptome level, providing insights into disease mechanisms
              [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;

              through polygenic scores [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w], and
              facilitating drug repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. With the
              increasing availability of gene expression data across various

              the transcription-wide association study (TWAS) has emerged as a
              powerful tool, integrating expression quantitative trait loci

              findings.


              Conclusion: However, TWAS operates at the individual gene level
              and fails to capture more intricate interactions within gene
              networks. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
              methodology that combines TWAS with functional genomics techniques
              such as gene co-expression analysis [@pmid:30469175] and
              clustering of complex traits [@pmid:28657628], enabling the

              **Context:** The Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) is a
              powerful approach in genetic studies that identifies disease
              associations through gene regulatory mechanisms and gene
              expression patterns [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;
              @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889;
              @doi:10.1038/ng.3367].


              **Content:** TWAS has significantly advanced our understanding of
              disease etiology at the transcriptome level by revealing
              associations between genetic variants and gene expression
              [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;
              @pmid:31036433]. This approach has shown success in various
              applications, including disease-risk prediction through polygenic
              scores [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing
              [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. The availability of gene expression data
              across multiple tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
              @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
              @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9] has made TWAS an effective tool
              for identifying biological processes related to disease.


              **Conclusion:** However, TWAS focuses on individual genes and does
              not capture more complex interactions at the network level
              [@pmid:33785449]. The manuscript aims to bridge this gap by
              exploring gene co-expression patterns to project genetic
              associations, providing a deeper understanding of disease etiology
              and potential therapeutic targets. This approach may also
              contribute to drug repurposing efforts by uncovering novel
              mechanisms for existing drugs.

              Context: Translating genetic associations into biological insights
              is a major goal in disease research. TWAS, a method that explores
              gene regulatory mechanisms, has proven successful in this regard
              [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
              @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367].


              Content: TWAS has significantly advanced our understanding of
              disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433], contributing to
              disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores
              [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing
              [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. This approach relies on gene expression
              data, which is increasingly available across various tissues
              [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;
              @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9].
              TWAS integrates eQTL data to provide a mechanistic interpretation
              for GWAS findings at the individual gene level.


              Conclusion: Despite its successes, TWAS does not capture more
              complex interactions at the network level. By applying functional
              genomics approaches such as gene co-expression analysis and
              clustering of complex traits [@doi:10.1374/jbc.R111.012895;
              @pmid:26628586], we aim to extend the capabilities of TWAS,
              enabling a more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology
              and drug mechanisms.

              **Context:** The Trans-disciplinary World Against Tobacco (TWAS)
              initiative focuses on elucidating the molecular mechanisms linking
              genetic variations to human diseases
              [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;

              **Content:** This approach, which centers around testing
              perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms, has led to
              significant advancements in understanding disease etiology at the
              transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]. These findings
              have not only expanded our knowledge of disease processes but also
              facilitated progress in disease-risk prediction through polygenic
              scores [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing

              provide a mechanistic explanation for GWAS results.


              **Conclusion:** Despite these achievements, TWAS remains limited
              in its ability to capture more intricate interactions occurring at
              the network level. Future research should focus on developing
              methods that can effectively incorporate network-level information
              into TWAS analyses to enhance our understanding of complex disease
              mechanisms.

              to individual gene analyses and do not effectively capture more
              intricate interactions occurring at the network level. This
              knowledge gap is addressed in our study by projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns using a
              clustering-based approach for complex trait analysis. Our
              methodology not only enhances the understanding of disease
              etiology but also provides valuable insights into therapeutic
              targets and drug mechanisms.

              **Content:** This methodology has proven successful in elucidating
              disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;

              findings.


              **Conclusion:** However, TWAS operates at the individual gene
              level and fails to capture more intricate network interactions.
              Therefore, this manuscript aims to extend TWAS capabilities by
              developing a novel methodology that integrates both gene
              expression data and protein-protein interaction networks to
              provide a comprehensive understanding of complex disease
              mechanisms. This advancement will potentially lead to improved
              disease-risk prediction models and the discovery of novel drug
              targets.

              Conclusion: This study aims to bridge this gap by applying gene
              co-expression analysis and clustering of complex traits to uncover
              potential disease mechanisms beyond single genes. By leveraging
              functional genomics data and advanced computational methods, we
              anticipate identifying novel therapeutic targets and drug
              repurposing opportunities for various diseases.

              Context: With the abundance of gene expression data in various
              tissues, there is a pressing need to identify underlying
              biological processes that contribute to human diseases.


              Content: Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) represent
              an effective approach for this purpose, as they integrate gene
              expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data and provide
              mechanistic explanations for genome-wide association study (GWAS)
              findings [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
              @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. These
              studies have proven successful in elucidating disease etiology at
              the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433], leading to
              advancements in disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores
              [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing efforts
              [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].


              Conclusion: Despite their accomplishments, TWAS currently lack the
              ability to capture complex interactions at the network level,
              which is crucial for understanding the intricacies of disease
              pathogenesis and developing effective therapeutic strategies. This
              manuscript aims to address this gap by proposing a novel
              methodology that extends TWAS beyond the individual gene level and
              enables the identification of disease-associated networks.

              In recent years, the accessibility of gene expression data across
              various tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;

              focuses on individual genes, yet it fails to capture more
              intricate interactions at the network level [@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]. Nevertheless,
              TWAS methodologies have proven highly successful in elucidating
              disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] and have

              drug repurposing tasks [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].


              (Context): The availability of gene expression data across various
              tissues has enabled the identification of biological processes
              through advanced analytical methods.


              (Content): Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) integrate
              expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a
              mechanistic explanation for genome-wide association study findings
              and have proven highly successful in elucidating disease etiology
              at the transcriptome level. However, TWAS focuses on individual
              genes and fails to capture more intricate interactions at the
              network level.


              (Conclusion): Despite their successes, TWAS methodologies have
              limitations, as they do not capture complex interactions at the
              network level. This manuscript aims to address this knowledge gap
              by proposing a novel approach that integrates both gene-level and
              network-level analyses for a more comprehensive understanding of
              biological processes.

              Content: TWAS integrates gene expression data with eQTLs to offer

              approach, which operates at the individual gene level, has
              significantly advanced our understanding of disease etiology at
              the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]. Furthermore,
              TWAS has proven effective in disease-risk prediction through the
              creation of polygenic scores [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and
              drug repurposing efforts [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].


              Conclusion: However, TWAS does not capture the complex
              interactions at the network level. This manuscript aims to address
              this gap by projecting genetic associations through gene
              expression patterns using a clustering approach for functional
              genomics and therapeutic targets discovery, ultimately
              contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms.

              associations.


              Content: Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) represent

              manuscript, we will present a novel methodology that utilizes gene
              co-expression networks to project genetic associations and uncover
              disease mechanisms, thereby expanding our understanding of
              therapeutic targets and drug repurposing opportunities.

              @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], researchers have turned to
              transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) as a powerful tool
              for identifying biological processes involved in human diseases
              [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;
              @pmid:31036433].


              Content: TWAS is a methodology that combines gene expression data
              with genetic variants, or eQTLs, to provide insights into the
              molecular mechanisms underlying genome-wide association study
              (GWAS) findings [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;

              @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This approach has proven successful in
              elucidating the transcriptome-level etiology of numerous diseases
              [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;
              @pmid:31036433]. Furthermore, TWAS has advanced our understanding
              of disease risk prediction [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w], drug
              repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618], and other applications

              Conclusion: While TWAS has been instrumental in advancing our
              knowledge of gene expression and disease associations at the
              individual gene level, it does not capture more intricate
              interactions occurring within biological networks. Future studies
              are necessary to develop methods that can extend the capabilities
              of TWAS beyond single genes and provide a more comprehensive
              understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying human
              diseases.

              Context: With the increasing availability of gene expression data
              across various tissues, there is a growing need to identify
              biological processes associated with complex traits and diseases.


              Content: Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) represent
              an effective approach to this challenge by integrating expression
              quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide mechanistic
              interpretations for genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining
              the text of a scientific manuscript titled 'Projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms' with keywords 'genetic studies,
              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise
              the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance
              clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The
              revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a
              Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure
              begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context),
              progresses through what is known from the literature (Content),
              and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap the
              manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1)
              preserve the original information as much as possible, with
              minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to
              scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the
              original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
              and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as
              "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;
              @pmid:31036433]", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate
              the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a
              single, cohesive paragraph.


              Input paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data
              across several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;

              @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to
              identify these biological processes is the transcription-wide
              association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative
              trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation
              for GWAS findings. However, TWAS works at the individual gene
              level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the
              network level. TWAS relies on testing whether perturbations in
              gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic
              variants and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;

              successful not only in understanding disease etiology at the

              Context: With an abundance of gene expression data obtainable from
              various tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
              @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
              @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], a productive method for
              pinpointing these biological processes is the transcription-wide
              association study (TWAS).


              Content: TWAS leverages the integration of expression quantitative
              trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer an explanatory framework for
              Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) results
              [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
              @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This
              approach has proven successful in elucidating disease etiology at
              the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] and has
              significantly contributed to disease-risk prediction
              [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w], drug repurposing
              [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618], and other applications.


              Conclusion: Despite its successes, TWAS operates at the individual
              gene level, thereby neglecting more intricate interactions within
              biological networks. Our study aims to extend the capabilities of
              TWAS by investigating network-level mechanisms underlying disease
              associations, offering a more comprehensive understanding of
              complex diseases and their underlying molecular mechanisms.
