**Context:** Genes function in intricate networks to execute various tasks, and their expression can influence complex traits and diseases.

**Content:** Previous research has established that genes collaborate within context-specific networks to carry out diverse functions [1-5]. Variations in these genes can alter their functional role and impact disease-relevant biological processes [6,7]. To understand how genes contribute to complex traits, it's essential to elucidate the mechanisms of gene expression regulation across different cell types [8-10]. Previously identified regulatory DNA elements have shed light on genetic effects on gene expression in various tissues [11]. Integrating functional genomics data and Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) data has enhanced our ability to identify these transcriptional mechanisms, which are often dysregulated, leading to tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology [12-14].

**Conclusion:** By projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns, this study aims to further clarify disease etiology and uncover potential therapeutic targets and drug mechanisms. This approach could pave the way for improved treatments and even drug repurposing by clustering complex traits based on their shared underlying molecular mechanisms.

TWAS integrates eQTL data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings at the individual gene level.

Conclusion: Despite its successes, TWAS does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. By applying functional genomics approaches such as gene co-expression analysis and clustering of complex traits [@doi:10.1374/jbc.R111.012895; @pmid:26628586], we aim to extend the capabilities of TWAS, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

This manuscript aims to address this gap by projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns using a clustering approach for functional genomics and therapeutic targets discovery, ultimately contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

Content: TWAS is a methodology that combines gene expression data with genetic variants, or eQTLs, to provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367].

Conclusion: While TWAS has been instrumental in advancing our knowledge of gene expression and disease associations at the individual gene level, it does not capture more intricate interactions occurring within biological networks.
