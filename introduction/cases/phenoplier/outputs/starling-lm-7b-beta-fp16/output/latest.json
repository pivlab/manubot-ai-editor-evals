Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format \"[@TYPE:ID]\" such as \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes work together in context-specific networks to karry out different functions [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259].

Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format \"[@TYPE:ID]\" such as \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes work together in context-specific networks to karry out different functions [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259].

With the availability of gene expression data across various tissues, researchers have turned to transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) as an effective approach to identify biological processes related to human diseases.\n\nContent: TWAS integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data and tests whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases. This method has been highly successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level, as demonstrated by numerous studies [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]. TWAS has also contributed to disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] efforts.\n\nConclusion: Despite its successes, TWAS operates at the individual gene level, which limits its ability to capture more complex interactions within biological networks. This knowledge gap highlights the need for further research into integrating network-level analyses and gene co-expression patterns in genetic studies, functional genomics, and therapeutic target identification, potentially leading to improved drug discovery and disease management strategies."

However, TWAS operates at the individual gene level, which limits its ability to capture more intricate interactions within biological networks.\n\nIn this revised paragraph, I have made several improvements to enhance clarity and readability:\n\n1. Replaced \"availability\" with \"wealth\" for a stronger description of the abundance of gene expression data.\n2. Rearranged the sentence structure to better flow and improve readability.\n3. Replaced \"perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases\" with a more concise phrase, \"determine whether disturbances in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the relationship between genetic variants and human diseases.\"\n4. Modified the phrasing of the last sentence to emphasize that TWAS operates at the individual gene level, limiting its ability to capture complex interactions within biological networks."

Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format \"[@TYPE:ID]\" such as \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.

A promising method to unravel the biological processes underlying these data is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which combines expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic explanation for genetic associations detected in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). TWAS investigates whether genetic variants' effects on human diseases are mediated by perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367].

The paragraph now follows the Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure by setting the stage with the availability of gene expression data, summarizing what is known from the literature about TWAS and its applications, and highlighting the knowledge gap regarding complex interactions at the network level that the manuscript aims to address."

TWAS focuses on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases, with successful applications in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433], disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w], and drug repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks.\n\nConclusion: However, TWAS currently operates at the individual gene level, limiting its ability to capture more complex interactions at the network level. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by exploring gene co-expression networks and their potential for enhancing our understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms through a comprehensive analysis of genetic studies, functional genomics, therapeutic targets, and drug repurposing in the context of clustering of complex traits."

Replaced \"availability\" with \"abundance\" for a clearer expression.\n2. Added commas after some DOIs and PMIDs for consistency in formatting.\n3. Changed \"mediate the association\" to \"determine if perturbations mediate the relationship\" for clarity.\n4. Replaced \"not only in understanding but also\" with \"as well as\" for conciseness.\n5. Added commas and hyphens in DOI references for improved readability.\n6. Changed \"does not capture more complex interactions at the network level\" to \"limiting its capacity to capture more intricate interactions within biological networks\" for a smoother flow of ideas."

Added commas and semicolons to separate different citations within the same sentence for better readability.\n3. Used hyphens in compound adjectives, such as \"transcription-wide\" and \"expression quantitative trait loci\".\n4. Rearranged the sentence structure for improved flow and coherence.\n5.

This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format \"[@TYPE:ID]\" such as \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: TWAS relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks.

By doing so, we hope to contribute to the ongoing advancements in genomics research and its applications in personalized medicine."

          "output": "**Context:** Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have emerged as a powerful tool in genetic research, offering insights into disease etiology and facilitating tasks such as polygenic risk prediction and drug repurposing.\n\n**Content:** These studies leverage gene regulatory mechanisms to explore associations between genetic variants and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367].

Addressing this gap in our understanding is crucial for advancing our knowledge of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, a focus of the present study."

          "output": "Context: In recent years, the wealth of gene expression data across various tissues has opened up new avenues for understanding complex biological processes and their relationships with human diseases. This has led to the development of transcription-wide association studies (TWAS), which integrate expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation of genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings.\n\nContent: While TWAS has been successful in identifying individual genes associated with diseases, it does not fully capture the complex interactions at the network level. The approach focuses on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases, which has led to significant advancements in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]. This has also contributed to improvements in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].\n\nConclusion: However, the current TWAS methodology has limitations in accounting for complex gene interactions and network dynamics. Our manuscript aims to address this knowledge gap by exploring alternative approaches, such as gene co-expression networks and clustering of complex traits, which may provide a more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately leading to the identification of novel therapeutic targets and improved drug repurposing strategies."

The context is set with a brief introduction of TWAS and its integration of eQTLs data. The content section discusses the limitations of TWAS in capturing complex interactions at the network level and the focus on individual genes. Finally, the conclusion highlights the successful applications of these approaches in understanding disease etiology, predicting disease risk, and drug repurposing."

Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format \"[@TYPE:ID]\" such as \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Genes work together in context-specific networks to karry out different functions [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259].

A promising approach to exploit this data is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide insights into the mechanisms underlying genetic associations discovered through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. TWAS investigates whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between genetic variants and human diseases, and these methods have been highly successful in elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] and in tasks such as disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. However, TWAS currently focuses on individual genes, limiting its ability to capture more complex interactions within biological networks.\n\nIn this revised paragraph, the original information is preserved with minimal changes, ensuring most references to scientific articles remain unaltered for academic integrity.

Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format \"[@TYPE:ID]\" such as \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.

A promising approach to address this is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which combines expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic understanding of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) findings. TWAS focuses on whether disturbances in gene regulatory mechanisms explain the connection between genetic variants and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367].

              "prompt": "You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format \"[@TYPE:ID]\" such as \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.

This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format \"[@TYPE:ID]\" such as \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks. However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the network level.\n\nRevised paragraph:\n",

Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format \"[@TYPE:ID]\" such as \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: TWAS relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks.

This has led to the development of transcription-wide association studies (TWAS), which integrate expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation of genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings.\n\nContent: While TWAS has been successful in identifying individual genes associated with diseases, it does not fully capture the complex interactions at the network level. The approach focuses on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases, which has led to significant advancements in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433].

Our manuscript aims to address this knowledge gap by exploring alternative approaches, such as gene co-expression networks and clustering of complex traits, which may provide a more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately leading to the identification of novel therapeutic targets and improved drug repurposing strategies.",

The Content discusses how TWAS works at the individual gene level and its focus on eQTLs data integration.

Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format \"[@TYPE:ID]\" such as \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.

To further understand these associations, transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) have been employed, which integrate expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic explanation for genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings.\n\nContent: While TWAS has significantly advanced our understanding of disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433], it operates at the individual gene level, limiting its ability to capture complex network interactions.

This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the format \"[@TYPE:ID]\" such as \"[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]\", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.\n\nInput paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. TWAS relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks.\n\nRevised paragraph:\n",

However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the network level. TWAS relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks.",
