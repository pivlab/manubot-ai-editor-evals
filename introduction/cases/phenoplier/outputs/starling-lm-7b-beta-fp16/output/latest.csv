Context: The study of gene expression patterns has become increasingly important in understanding disease etiology and drug mechanisms. With the availability of gene expression data across various tissues, researchers have turned to transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) as an effective approach to identify biological processes related to human diseases.

Content: TWAS integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data and tests whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases. This method has been highly successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level, as demonstrated by numerous studies [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433].

Conclusion: Despite its successes, TWAS operates at the individual gene level, which limits its ability to capture more complex interactions within biological networks. This knowledge gap highlights the need for further research into integrating network-level analyses and gene co-expression patterns in genetic studies, functional genomics, and therapeutic target identification, potentially leading to improved drug discovery and disease management strategies.

Context: With the increasing availability of gene expression data across various tissues and the development of advanced computational methods, there is a growing need to understand the complex relationships between genetic variations, gene expression patterns, and disease etiology.

Content: Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) have emerged as an effective approach to investigate these relationships by integrating expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data with genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings. TWAS aims to test whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases, providing a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS results [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367].

This has led to the development of transcription-wide association studies (TWAS), which integrate expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation of genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings.

Content: While TWAS has been successful in identifying individual genes associated with diseases, it does not fully capture the complex interactions at the network level. The approach focuses on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases, which has led to significant advancements in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]. This has also contributed to improvements in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].

Conclusion: However, the current TWAS methodology has limitations in accounting for complex gene interactions and network dynamics. Our manuscript aims to address this knowledge gap by exploring alternative approaches, such as gene co-expression networks and clustering of complex traits, which may provide a more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately leading to the identification of novel therapeutic targets and improved drug repurposing strategies.
