          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' with keywords 'genetic studies,

          reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should
          adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion
          (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one
          or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the

          paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C
          structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.

          Genes collaborate in context-specific networks to execute various
          functions [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259]. Variations within
          these genes can alter their functional roles and, consequently, impact
          disease-relevant biological processes
          [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6]. In this context, understanding how
          genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic
          comprehension of expression regulation across diverse cell types
          [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3;
          @doi:10.1038/s41576-019-0200-9], which should ultimately lead to
          enhanced treatments [@doi:10.1038/ng.3314;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008489]. Previous investigations have
          outlined various regulatory DNA elements [@doi:10.1038/nature11247;

          the identification of these transcriptional mechanisms that, when
          disrupted, frequently result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific
          pathologies [@pmid:20624743; @pmid:14707169;
          @doi:10.1073/pnas.0810772105]. However, a comprehensive understanding
          of how genetic associations can be projected through gene expression
          patterns to highlight disease etiology and drug mechanisms remains
          elusive. This manuscript aims to address this gap by leveraging the
          power of functional genomics and clustering of complex traits for
          potential therapeutic target discovery and drug repurposing.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the
          format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]", and 4) the revised
          paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C
          structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript titled 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' with keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should
          adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion
          (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one
          or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the
          format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' with keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should
          adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion
          (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one
          or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following

          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS
          relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms
          mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these

          (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] as well as drug
          repurposing tasks [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. However, TWAS operates at
          the individual gene level, thereby overlooking more intricate
          interactions occurring at the network level. This limitation
          underscores a significant gap in our understanding of complex trait
          clustering and disease etiology, which this manuscript aims to address
          by projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the
          format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]", and 4) the revised
          paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C
          structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.

          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS
          relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms
          mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases

          approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in

          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks. However, TWAS works at the individual
          gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the
          network level.

          that it operates at the individual gene level, which inherently fails
          to capture more complex interactions occurring at the network level.
          This manuscript aims to address this knowledge gap by proposing an
          innovative approach to extend TWAS beyond single genes and into the
          realm of gene networks.

          powerful method for uncovering biological processes is the
          transcription-wide association study (TWAS). This approach integrates
          expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data to offer an explanation
          behind genome-wide association studies (GWAS) findings.


          Content: However, TWAS focuses on individual genes and fails to
          capture intricate interactions at the network level. It functions by
          examining whether alterations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate
          associations between genetic variants and human diseases
          [[@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]]. These
          methods have been highly effective in understanding disease etiology
          at the transcriptome level [[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]], predicting disease
          risk using polygenic scores [[@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w]], and
          repurposing drugs for new therapeutic uses [[@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]].


          Conclusion: Despite these successes, TWAS's focus on individual genes
          leaves a gap in understanding complex network interactions, which is
          crucial for fully comprehending disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
          This manuscript aims to address this knowledge gap by projecting
          genetic associations through gene expression patterns, thereby
          highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          effective method to pinpoint these biological processes is the

          remains a gap in our understanding of how these genetic variants

          powerful method for identifying biological processes is the
          transcription-wide association study (TWAS). TWAS integrates

          Nevertheless, TWAS operates at the single gene level, which may not
          fully capture intricate network-level interactions. Despite this
          limitation, these approaches have proven highly successful in
          understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level

          leaves a gap in our understanding of complex interactions at the
          network level, which is an area that this manuscript aims to address.

          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify
          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.
          However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not
          capture more complex interactions at the network level. TWAS relies on
          testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate
          the association between genetic variants and human diseases

          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these
          approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in
          disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)
          [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing

          In light of the abundance of gene expression data spanning multiple

          @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], a
          powerful method to pinpoint these biological processes is the
          transcription-wide association study (TWAS). TWAS incorporates
          expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data, offering mechanistic
          insights for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) results.
          Nevertheless, TWAS operates at an individual gene level, potentially
          overlooking intricate network interactions
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506]. This
          approach scrutinizes whether alterations in gene regulatory mechanisms
          mediate the relationship between genetic variants and human diseases
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. These
          methods have not only advanced our understanding of disease etiology
          at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also contributed
          to disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)
          [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing tasks
          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. However, the current TWAS framework does not
          fully capture complex gene interactions at a network level,
          highlighting the need for more sophisticated approaches to unravel
          these relationships.

              Integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data has enhanced
              the identification of transcriptional mechanisms, which when
              dysregulated, often result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific

              However, a more comprehensive understanding of these genetic
              associations and their implications for disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms remains elusive. This study aims to address this gap by
              projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining
              the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the
              following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance
              clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The
              revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a
              Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure
              begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context),
              progresses through what is known from the literature (Content),
              and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap the
              manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1)
              preserve the original information as much as possible, with
              minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to
              scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the
              original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
              and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as
              "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;
              @pmid:31036433]", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate
              the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a
              single, cohesive paragraph.

              focuses on individual genes, overlooking complex interactions at

              powerful method to pinpoint these biological processes is the
              transcription-wide association study (TWAS). This approach
              integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data,
              offering a mechanistic explanation for genome-wide association

              have proven highly effective not only in understanding disease
              etiology at the transcriptome level but also in predicting disease
              risk (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug
              repurposing tasks [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. Nonetheless, TWAS
              primarily focuses on individual genes, potentially overlooking
              intricate interactions at the network level.

              Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have emerged as a
              powerful tool in understanding the genetic underpinnings of human
              diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;

              TWAS extends beyond mere disease etiology comprehension at the
              transcriptome level, as it also aids in predicting disease risk

              TWAS offers an effective means to identify these biological
              processes by integrating expression quantitative trait loci
              (eQTLs) data, thereby providing a mechanistic interpretation for
              genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings. However, a
              significant limitation of TWAS is that it operates at the
              individual gene level, which inherently fails to capture more
              complex interactions occurring at the network level. This
              manuscript aims to address this knowledge gap by proposing an
              innovative approach to extend TWAS beyond single genes and into
              the realm of gene networks.

              mechanisms mediate the relationship between genetic variants and
              diseases, providing valuable insights into disease etiology at the
              transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]. Beyond disease
              understanding, TWAS have also been instrumental in predicting
              disease risk through polygenic scores
              [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and repurposing drugs for novel

              the transcription-wide association study (TWAS) has emerged as a
              powerful tool to unravel underlying biological processes. By
              integrating expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data, TWAS
              offers mechanistic insights into genome-wide association studies

              has been instrumental in understanding disease etiology

              Context: With the abundance of gene expression data spanning
              various tissues [[@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
              @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
              @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]], a powerful method for
              uncovering biological processes is the transcription-wide
              association study (TWAS). This approach integrates expression
              quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data to offer an explanation behind
              genome-wide association studies (GWAS) findings.


              Content: However, TWAS focuses on individual genes and fails to
              capture intricate interactions at the network level. It functions
              by examining whether alterations in gene regulatory mechanisms
              mediate associations between genetic variants and human diseases
              [[@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
              @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]]. These
              methods have been highly effective in understanding disease
              etiology at the transcriptome level [[@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]], predicting
              disease risk using polygenic scores
              [[@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w]], and repurposing drugs for new
              therapeutic uses [[@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]].


              Conclusion: Despite these successes, TWAS's focus on individual
              genes leaves a gap in understanding complex network interactions,
              which is crucial for fully comprehending disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms. This manuscript aims to address this knowledge gap by
              projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns,
              thereby highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms.
