          adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion
          (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one
          or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these

          adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion
          (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one
          or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these

          Genes interact in networks to perform various functions, with

          disease-relevant biological processes [@pmid:19104045;

          Integrating functional genomics data and genome-wide association
          studies (GWAS) has enhanced the identification of transcriptional
          mechanisms, whose dysregulation often results in tissue- and cell

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the
          format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]", and 4) the revised
          paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C
          structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript titled 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' with keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should
          adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion
          (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one
          or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the
          format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]", and 4) the revised
          paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C
          structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section.

          several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;

          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS
          relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms
          mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;

          approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;

          gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the
          network level.

          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these

          operates by examining whether alterations in gene regulatory
          mechanisms mediate the relationship between genetic variants and human

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these

          biological processes, a gap this manuscript aims to address.

          this gap by exploring gene co-expression patterns and cluster
          analysis, which could provide insights into disease etiology,
          potential therapeutic targets, and drug repurposing opportunities.

          In light of the abundance of gene expression data spanning multiple
          tissues [[@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;

          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]](Context), a powerful method to
          pinpoint these biological processes is the transcription-wide
          association study (TWAS). This approach integrates expression
          quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data, thereby offering mechanistic
          insights into genome-wide association studies (GWAS) findings
          [[@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;

          However, TWAS primarily focuses on individual genes, potentially
          overlooking complex interactions at the network level. Despite this
          limitation, these methods have proven highly effective in deciphering
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level [[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]] and have been
          instrumental in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)
          [[@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w]] as well as drug repurposing tasks
          [[@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]](Conclusion). Nevertheless, there remains a
          gap in understanding and accounting for network-level interactions,
          which this manuscript aims to address.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the
          format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;

          Input paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across
          several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify
          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.
          However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not
          capture more complex interactions at the network level. TWAS relies on
          testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate
          the association between genetic variants and human diseases
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these
          approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in

          The advent of gene expression data across various tissues has paved
          the way for innovative approaches to identify underlying biological
          processes [[@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;
          @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]]. One
          such method is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which
          integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide
          a mechanistic interpretation for genome-wide association studies
          (GWAS) findings. Nonetheless, TWAS operates at an individual gene
          level and does not fully capture complex interactions occurring at the
          network level [[@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;

          @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]]. TWAS tests whether perturbations in gene
          regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants
          and human diseases, contributing significantly to our understanding of
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level [[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]]. Moreover, these

          repurposing tasks [[@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]]. However, the current
          knowledge gap lies in understanding complex gene interactions at a
          network level, which is not addressed by TWAS methodology.

              Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have emerged as a
              powerful tool in understanding the genetic underpinnings of human
              diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
              @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. These
              studies leverage the concept of testing perturbations in gene
              regulatory mechanisms to establish associations between genetic
              variants and diseases. The success of TWAS is not only limited to
              elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome level
              [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]
              but also extends to disease-risk prediction using polygenic scores
              [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing tasks
              [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. Given the availability of gene expression
              data across multiple tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;

              @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], TWAS serves as an effective
              approach to identify these biological processes by integrating
              expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data, thereby providing
              a mechanistic interpretation for GWA studies findings. However, it
              is important to note that TWAS primarily operates at the
              individual gene level, which may not fully capture more complex
              interactions occurring at the network level.

              level, thereby limiting its capacity to capture more intricate
              interactions occurring at the network level.

              ---

              Given the availability of gene expression data across multiple
              tissues (Gamazon et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018; Wainberg et al.,
              2019; Zhernakova et al., 2020), an effective approach to identify
              these biological processes is the transcriptome-wide association
              study (TWAS). TWAS integrates expression quantitative trait loci
              (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS
              findings. However, TWAS operates at the individual gene level,
              which does not capture more complex interactions at the network
              level. TWAS relies on testing whether perturbations in gene
              regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic
              variants and human diseases (Gusev et al., 2016; Albert &
              Kruglyak, 2015; Gamazon et al., 2015; Nicolae et al., 2010). These
              approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding
              disease etiology at the transcriptome level (Yazar et al., 2021;
              Wang & Li, 2021; Zeng et al., 2020) but also in disease-risk
              prediction (polygenic scores) (Khera et al., 2018) and drug
              repurposing tasks (Gamazon et al., 2015).

              comprehensive understanding of biological processes. One such
              approach is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which
              integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to
              provide insights into the mechanisms underlying genome-wide

              TWAS primarily focuses on individual genes, potentially
              overlooking more intricate interactions at the network level.
              Despite this limitation, these methods have proven effective in
              elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome level

            Given the availability of gene expression data across several
            tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;
            @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an
            effective approach to identify these biological processes is the
            transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates
            expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a
            mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. However, TWAS works at
            the individual gene level, which does not capture more complex
            interactions at the network level. TWAS relies on testing whether
            perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association
            between genetic variants and human diseases

            @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these
            approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding
            disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
            @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in
            disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)
            [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing
            [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks.
