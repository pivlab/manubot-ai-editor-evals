          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear in
          formats like "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;
          @pmid:31036433]", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the
          entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single,
          cohesive paragraph.

          In the intricate world of genetics, genes do not operate in isolation

          various functions [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259]. These

          Genes operate in context-specific networks to perform varying
          functions [references]. Alterations in these genes can modify their
          functional role and, on a broader scale, influence disease-related
          biological processes [references]. In this scenario, it is crucial to
          understand the mechanistic regulation of gene expression across
          different cell types to determine how genes affect complex traits
          [references]. This understanding should ultimately lead to the
          development of improved treatments [references]. Previous research has
          outlined various regulatory DNA elements [references], including the
          genetic effects on gene expression across different tissues

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear in
          formats like "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;

          entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single,
          cohesive paragraph.

          With the widespread availability of gene expression data across
          numerous tissues, an effective approach to identifying biological
          processes is through transcription-wide association studies (TWAS)
          [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;
          @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. These
          studies integrate expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data,
          providing a mechanistic interpretation of GWAS findings. The basis of
          TWAS is to test whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms
          mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This
          approach has proven highly successful, not only in understanding
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in
          predicting disease risk (using polygenic scores)
          [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and repurposing drugs
          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. However, a limitation of TWAS is that it
          operates at the individual gene level, thereby failing to capture more
          complex interactions at the network level.

          functions [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259], with alterations in
          these genes potentially changing their roles and influencing
          disease-related biological processes
          [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6]. To comprehend how genes affect
          complex traits, it is crucial to understand the regulation of gene
          expression across diverse cell types [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;

          understanding could pave the way for the development of more effective
          treatments [@doi:10.1038/ng.3314; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008489].
          Prior research has outlined various regulatory DNA elements

          @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3], including the genetic impact on gene
          expression across different tissues [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776].
          The integration of functional genomics data with GWAS data
          [@doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0081-4; @doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.04.002;
          @doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0081-4; @doi:10.1038/ncomms6890] has enhanced
          the identification of transcriptional mechanisms. When these
          mechanisms are disrupted, they often lead to pathology that is
          specific to tissue and cell lineage [@pmid:20624743; @pmid:14707169;
          @doi:10.1073/pnas.0810772105]. However, our understanding of these
          complex mechanisms and their roles in disease pathology remains
          incomplete, thus warranting further investigation.

          With the accessibility of gene expression data across various tissues,
          the transcription-wide association study (TWAS) presents an effective
          approach to identify these biological processes. This approach
          integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data, providing
          a mechanistic interpretation for Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS)
          findings. TWAS is dependent on the testing of whether disruptions in
          gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic
          variants and human diseases. These methods have proven highly
          effective not only in understanding disease etiology at the
          transcriptome level, but also in predicting disease risk through
          polygenic scores and in drug repurposing tasks. However, it should be
          noted that TWAS operates at the individual gene level, which does not
          account for more complex interactions at the network level.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear in
          formats like "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;

          The advent of gene expression data across a multitude of tissues has

          leverage this data, the transcription-wide association study (TWAS)
          has proven effective. TWAS integrates data on expression quantitative
          trait loci (eQTLs) to provide mechanistic explanations for findings
          from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). It does so by examining
          the potential mediating role of gene regulatory mechanisms in the

          approach has been instrumental not only in understanding disease
          origins at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;

          remains in our understanding: TWAS operates at the level of individual
          genes, thereby overlooking potentially intricate interactions
          occurring at the network level.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear in
          formats like "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;
          @pmid:31036433]", and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the
          entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a single,
          cohesive paragraph.


          Input paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across
          several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify
          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS
          relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms
          mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these
          approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in
          disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)
          [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing
          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks. However, TWAS works at the individual
          gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the
          network level.

          With the advent of gene expression data across a range of tissues

          @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1038/s13040-020-00216-9], new
          methods have been developed to identify biological processes. One such
          method, the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), utilizes
          expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to interpret the
          mechanisms behind Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) findings. TWAS
          assesses whether changes in gene regulation can explain the link
          between genetic variants and human diseases
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This
          approach has been highly effective in understanding disease origins at
          the level of the transcriptome [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433], predicting disease
          risk using polygenic scores [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w], and
          repurposing drugs [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. However, TWAS operates at
          the individual gene level and therefore does not account for more
          intricate interactions at the network level. This gap in our
          understanding underscores the need for new approaches that can capture
          these complex interactions.

          [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;
          @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. One
          such approach, the transcription-wide association study (TWAS),
          leverages data on variations in gene expression (eQTLs) to interpret
          the mechanistic implications of genome-wide association studies
          (GWAS). This approach tests the hypothesis that changes in gene
          regulation mechanisms can explain the link between genetic variants
          and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;
          @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889;
          @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. The successful application of TWAS has not only
          enhanced our understanding of disease origins at the transcriptome
          level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;

          scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing
          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. However, a significant limitation of TWAS is
          its focus on individual genes, which overlooks the potential for more
          complex interactions at the network level.

          formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure.
          This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences
          (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature
          (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge
          gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1)
          preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal
          changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles
          are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These references

          Transcription-Wide Association Studies (TWAS) operate on the principle
          of testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate
          the association between genetic variants and human diseases. Numerous
          studies have demonstrated the high success of this approach in
          understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level, as well as
          in disease risk prediction (polygenic scores) and drug repurposing
          tasks. Given the abundance of gene expression data across various
          tissues, TWAS proves to be an effective method for identifying these
          biological processes. This approach integrates expression quantitative
          trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for
          Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) findings. However, it should be
          noted that TWAS operates at the individual gene level, and therefore,
          does not capture more complex interactions at the network level.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear in
          formats like "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;

          A vast amount of gene expression data across various tissues is now

          within this data, scientists have been using a method called a
          transcription-wide association study (TWAS). This approach combines
          data from expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) to provide a
          mechanistic explanation for the results of genome-wide association
          studies (GWAS). TWAS methods test if disturbances in gene regulation
          are the link between genetic variants and human diseases
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;

          gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms' with keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene
          co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of

          formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure.
          This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences

          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.
          However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not
          capture more complex interactions at the network level.

          The transcription-wide association study (TWAS) is a crucial tool in
          modern genetic studies that investigates the link between genetic
          variations and human diseases by examining changes in gene regulatory
          mechanisms [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This method
          has proven to be highly effective, not only in enhancing our
          understanding of disease origins at the transcriptome level
          [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433],
          but also in predicting disease risk (using polygenic scores)
          [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and repurposing drugs for new
          therapeutic targets [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. The wealth of gene
          expression data across various tissues further bolsters the utility of
          TWAS [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;

          Despite these successes, a significant limitation of TWAS is its focus
          on individual genes, which overlooks the more intricate interactions
          that occur at the network level of gene co-expression. This study aims
          to address this gap by exploring the complex trait clustering through
          gene expression patterns.

          Transcription-Wide Association Studies (TWAS) are predicated on the
          testing of whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate
          the association between genetic variants and human diseases. These

          disease risk through polygenic scores, and in drug repurposing tasks.
          With the availability of gene expression data across numerous tissues,
          TWAS has emerged as an effective method for identifying these

          Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTLs) data, providing a mechanistic
          interpretation for Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) findings.
          However, it's important to note that TWAS operates at the individual
          gene level, and therefore does not capture more complex interactions
          at the network level.

          Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) are reliant on the
          evaluation of whether disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms serve
          as a mediator in the relationship between genetic variants and human
          diseases. This methodology has proven to be highly effective in not
          only understanding the etiology of diseases at the transcriptome
          level, but also in predicting disease risk through polygenic scores
          and in tasks related to drug repurposing. With the availability of
          gene expression data across numerous tissues, TWAS provides an
          efficient approach to identifying these biological processes. This
          method integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data,
          thereby providing a mechanistic interpretation of genome-wide
          association studies (GWAS) findings. However, it should be noted that
          TWAS operates at the individual gene level and may not fully capture
          the complexity of interactions occurring at the network level.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a manuscript titled 'Projecting genetic associations through
          gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms' with keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene
          co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of
          complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from
          the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and
          maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown
          formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure.
          This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences
          (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature
          (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge
          gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1)
          preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal
          changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles
          are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These references
          are crucial for academic integrity and may appear in formats like
          "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]",
          and 4) the revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision,
          following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.


          Input paragraph: TWAS relies on testing whether perturbations in gene
          regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants
          and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;

          @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these approaches have been highly
          successful not only in understanding disease etiology at the
          transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;
          @pmid:31036433] but also in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)
          [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing
          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks. Given the availability of gene
          expression data across several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;

          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify
          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.
          However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not
          capture more complex interactions at the network level.

          The exploration of genetic associations with human diseases often
          involves investigating disruptions in gene regulation mechanisms, a
          process facilitated by transcription-wide association studies (TWAS)
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. These
          studies have significantly contributed to our understanding of disease
          origins at the level of gene expression, or the transcriptome
          [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]. In
          addition, they have proven valuable in predicting disease risk through
          polygenic scores [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and in identifying
          potential new uses for existing drugs, a practice known as drug
          repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. The growing accessibility of gene
          expression data from various tissues further enhances the utility of
          TWAS [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;
          @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9].
          However, a limitation of current TWAS approaches is that they
          typically focus on individual genes, thereby overlooking the
          potentially more complex relationships that exist at the network
          level. This manuscript addresses this gap by exploring the role of
          gene co-expression in disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          Given the accessibility of gene expression data across various
          tissues, the transcription-wide association study (TWAS) has emerged
          as an effective approach to identify relevant biological processes.
          This method integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data, offering a mechanistic interpretation of Genome-Wide Association
          Study (GWAS) findings. However, TWAS operates on the individual gene
          level and does not account for more complex interactions at the
          network level. The efficacy of TWAS is based on testing whether
          perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association

          only proven highly successful in understanding disease etiology at the
          transcriptome level but has also shown promise in disease-risk
          prediction (polygenic scores) and drug repurposing tasks.

          gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug
          mechanisms' with keywords 'genetic studies, functional genomics, gene
          co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of
          complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the following paragraph from
          the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce jargon, and
          maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to Markdown
          formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure.
          This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences
          (Context), progresses through what is known from the literature
          (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge
          gap your manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1)
          preserve the original information as much as possible, with minimal
          changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific articles
          are kept exactly as they appear in the original text. These references
          are crucial for academic integrity and may appear in formats like
          "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]",

          following the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.


          Input paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across
          several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;

          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify
          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.
          However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not
          capture more complex interactions at the network level. TWAS relies on
          testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate
          the association between genetic variants and human diseases

          approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;

          The increasing accessibility of gene expression data across various

          processes [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;
          @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. A key
          method for this exploration is the transcription-wide association
          study (TWAS), which utilizes expression quantitative trait loci
          (eQTLs) data to offer mechanistic insights into the findings of
          genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Despite its effectiveness,
          TWAS primarily operates at the level of individual genes, and thus,
          fails to encapsulate the complexity of network-level interactions.
          This method is based on the principle of testing whether changes in
          gene regulation mechanisms mediate the relationship between genetic
          variants and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;

          methods that can capture the intricate interactions at the network
          level, a gap that our research aims to fill.

          Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) have emerged as a
          powerful tool to investigate the influence of genetic variations on

          transcription-wide association study (TWAS) has emerged as an
          effective tool for identifying biological processes. TWAS integrates
          expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer mechanistic
          explanations for genetic findings associated with diseases. Despite
          its effectiveness, TWAS operates on an individual gene level, thus not
          fully encompassing the intricate interactions that occur at the
          network level. TWAS's methodology hinges on testing if disruptions in
          gene regulatory mechanisms serve as a bridge between genetic
          variations and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;

          Considering the abundant availability of gene expression data across
          various tissues, the transcription-wide association study (TWAS)
          serves as an effective approach to identify biological processes. TWAS
          incorporates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data, thereby
          providing a mechanistic interpretation of Genome-Wide Association
          Study (GWAS) findings. However, TWAS primarily operates at the
          individual gene level, which limits its ability to capture more
          intricate interactions at the network level. TWAS tests the hypothesis
          that perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the
          association between genetic variants and human diseases. This approach
          has proven to be highly successful, not only in understanding disease
          etiology at the transcriptome level but also in predicting disease
          risk through polygenic scores and in drug repurposing tasks.

          uses expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a
          mechanistic explanation for findings from genome-wide association
          studies (GWAS). It operates by testing if changes in gene regulatory
          processes mediate the relationship between genetic variations and
          human diseases. This approach has been tremendously successful in both
          understanding disease origins at the transcriptome level and

          With the current abundance of gene expression data across various
          tissues, the transcription-wide association study (TWAS) presents an
          effective method for identifying biological processes. This approach
          integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data, providing
          a mechanistic interpretation for Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS)
          findings. However, TWAS operates at the level of individual genes and
          fails to capture more intricate interactions at the network level. It
          tests whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the
          association between genetic variants and human diseases. These
          approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level but also in predicting
          disease risk (via polygenic scores) and in drug repurposing tasks.

          Input paragraph: Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach
          that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The
          flexibility of our method allows integrating different data modalities
          into the same representation for a joint analysis. We show that this
          module perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes
          influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic
          properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations
          affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps
          gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses
          into a common latent representation. For this, we integrate thousands
          of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan
          [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs
          (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a
          low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens
          of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
          [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a
          latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach
          [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that
          extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
          preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When
          mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells,
          corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological
          assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose
          tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell
          types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large
          and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
          associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states.
          We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan
          (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records
          and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72;

          Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in
          HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules
          than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be
          involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance.
          Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also
          better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing
          tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the
          mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits
          via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction
          suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine
          drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring
          the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
          with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
          with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In
          summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different
          complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act
          together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This
          approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic
          associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and
          potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single
          gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a
          conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the
          potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations
          to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic
          modalities.

          Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach that provides a gene
          module perspective to genetic studies. The flexibility of our method
          allows integrating different data modalities into the same
          representation for a joint analysis. We show that this module
          perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes
          influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic
          properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations
          affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps
          gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses
          into a common latent representation. For this, we integrate thousands
          of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan
          [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs
          (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a
          low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens
          of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
          [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a
          latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach
          [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that
          extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
          preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When
          mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells,
          corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological
          assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose
          tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell
          types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large
          and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
          associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states.
          We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan
          (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records
          and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort).
          Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in
          HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules
          than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be
          involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance.
          Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also
          better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing
          tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the
          mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits
          via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction
          suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine
          drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring
          the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
          with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
          with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In
          summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different
          complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act
          together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This
          approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic
          associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and
          potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single
          gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a
          conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the
          potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations

          modalities.

        output: >-
          In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel method for genetic
          analysis that offers a comprehensive view of gene modules, or groups
          of functionally-related genes, and their influence on complex traits
          (Context). Our approach incorporates different data types into a
          unified analysis, allowing us to discern shared and unique
          transcriptomic properties among traits and predict the impact of drug
          interventions on gene activity. PhenoPLIER achieves this by mapping
          gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses
          into a common representation. This is accomplished by integrating
          thousands of gene-trait associations from PhenomeXcan
          [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083] and drug transcriptional profiles from
          LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049] into a low-dimensional
          space derived from public gene expression data on numerous RNA-seq
          samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003;
          @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We utilize a latent representation defined by
          a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1;
          @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that identifies gene modules under
          certain constraints and preferences for those that align with
          established knowledge (pathways). Our results demonstrate that
          diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
          relevant cell types, and we can identify modules associated with cell
          types in specific disease states or under particular stimuli. Our
          findings using PhenoPLIER were replicated in the Electronic Medical
          Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III
          [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225]. We also
          conducted a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells,
          further validating our module-based approach. Notably, PhenoPLIER
          outperformed single-gene methods in predicting FDA-approved
          drug-disease links, suggesting that gene modules may offer a more
          effective way to examine drug-disease relationships (Content). In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER represents a significant advancement in genetic
          studies by focusing on gene modules rather than individual genes. This
          approach enhances the robustness of detecting and interpreting genetic
          associations and can highlight alternative and potentially more
          promising candidate targets, even when known single gene associations
          are not detected. This innovation could lead to a deeper understanding
          of complex diseases and their therapeutic options, signifying a
          paradigm shift in genetic research (Conclusion).

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section.


          Input paragraph: Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach
          that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The
          flexibility of our method allows integrating different data modalities
          into the same representation for a joint analysis. We show that this

          influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic
          properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations
          affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps
          gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses
          into a common latent representation. For this, we integrate thousands
          of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan
          [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs
          (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a
          low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens
          of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
          [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a
          latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach
          [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that
          extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
          preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When
          mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells,
          corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological
          assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose
          tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell
          types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large
          and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
          associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states.
          We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan
          (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records
          and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort).
          Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in
          HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules
          than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be
          involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance.
          Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also
          better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing
          tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the
          mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits
          via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction
          suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine
          drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring
          the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
          with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
          with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In
          summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different
          complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act
          together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This
          approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic
          associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and
          potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single
          gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a
          conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the
          potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations
          to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic
          modalities.

          In this paper, we introduce PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic tool that brings
          a gene module perspective to genetic research. Our method is flexible
          and capable of integrating different data types into one
          representation for a comprehensive analysis. We demonstrate that this
          module perspective can deduce how clusters of functionally-related
          genes affect complex traits, identify shared and unique transcriptomic
          properties among traits, and predict the influence of pharmacological
          interventions on gene activity. PhenoPLIER aligns gene-trait
          associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses in a shared
          latent representation. To accomplish this, we incorporate thousands of
          gene-trait associations (utilizing TWAS from PhenomeXcan) and
          transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000) into a
          low-dimensional space, derived from publicly available gene expression
          data from tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2). We employ a
          latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach that
          isolates gene modules with specific sparsity constraints and
          preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When
          mapping gene-trait associations to this compressed expression space,
          we note that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, such as T cells with hypothyroidism,
          and corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, among
          others. Notably, PhenoPLIER can utilize models derived from large and
          diverse RNA-seq datasets, allowing us to also identify modules
          associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease
          conditions. We found that significant module-trait associations in
          PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) were replicated in the Electronic
          Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III (our
          replication cohort). Additionally, we conducted a CRISPR screen to
          analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells, observing that trait
          associations were more robust with modules than with individual genes.
          Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also
          predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links more accurately by capturing
          tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the drugs'
          mechanism of action. This suggests that modules may be more effective
          in examining drug-disease relationships than individual genes.
          Finally, our exploration of the phenotype-module space revealed stable
          trait clusters associated with relevant tissues. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER offers a novel approach in interpreting genetic studies by
          focusing on groups of genes that work together in specific cell types
          rather than individual genes. This approach enhances the robustness in
          detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and we demonstrate
          its potential in prioritizing alternative and potentially more
          promising candidate targets, even when known single gene associations
          are not detected. This represents a significant shift in the
          interpretation of genetic studies and has the potential to provide
          mechanistic insights from statistical associations, thereby enhancing
          our understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic
          modalities.

          Input paragraph: Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach
          that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The
          flexibility of our method allows integrating different data modalities
          into the same representation for a joint analysis. We show that this
          module perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes
          influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic
          properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations
          affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps
          gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses
          into a common latent representation. For this, we integrate thousands
          of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan
          [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs
          (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a
          low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens
          of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
          [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a
          latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach
          [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that
          extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
          preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When
          mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells,
          corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological
          assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose
          tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell
          types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large
          and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
          associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states.
          We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan
          (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records
          and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort).
          Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in
          HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules
          than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be
          involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance.
          Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also
          better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing
          tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the
          mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits
          via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction
          suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine
          drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring
          the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
          with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
          with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In
          summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different
          complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act
          together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This
          approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic
          associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and
          potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single
          gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a
          conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the
          potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations
          to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic
          modalities.

          In the context of genetic studies, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
          comprehensive method that adopts a modular approach to understanding
          gene function and interaction. Our method combines various data types
          for a unified analysis, enabling the inference of how
          functionally-linked gene groups influence complex traits, the
          identification of shared and distinct transcriptomic characteristics
          among these traits, and the prediction of how drug interventions
          impact gene activity. PhenoPLIER achieves this by mapping gene-trait
          associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a shared
          latent representation, integrating thousands of gene-trait
          associations from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083] and drug
          transcriptional profiles from LINCS L1000
          [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049] into a low-dimensional space derived
          from extensive public gene expression data
          [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]. This latent
          representation, defined by a matrix factorization approach
          [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003],
          extracts gene modules under specific constraints, favoring those that
          align with established knowledge. We find that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. Additionally, our approach allows for the identification of
          modules linked with cell types under specific conditions or disease
          states. Importantly, we find that our module-trait associations
          replicated in the eMERGE network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225], and that our module-based method
          outperforms single-gene approaches in predicting FDA-approved
          drug-disease associations, suggesting that modules may be a superior
          means to explore drug-disease relationships. Finally, we reveal stable
          trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, indicating a complex
          relationship between lipids and cardiovascular, autoimmune, and
          neuropsychiatric disorders. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER represents a
          paradigm shift in the interpretation of genetic studies, focusing on
          groups of genes that work together within specific cell types. This
          approach enhances the robustness of detecting and interpreting genetic
          associations, offering the potential to reveal more promising
          candidate targets for therapeutic interventions and advance our
          understanding of complex diseases.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the

          In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach that
          offers a gene module perspective for genetic studies. Our method's
          flexibility enables the integration of various data types into a
          unified representation for combined analysis. We demonstrate that this
          module perspective can deduce how clusters of functionally-related
          genes affect complex traits, identify shared and unique transcriptomic
          characteristics among traits, and predict the impact of
          pharmacological interventions on gene activity. PhenoPLIER
          consolidates gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional
          responses into a shared latent representation. To achieve this, we
          incorporate thousands of gene-trait associations (sourced from
          PhenomeXcan's TWAS [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional
          profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049])
          into a low-dimensional space derived from public gene expression data
          of tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
          [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We employ a
          latent representation, defined by a matrix factorization approach
          [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003],
          that extracts gene modules with specific sparsity constraints and
          preferences for those aligning with prior knowledge (pathways). When
          mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we
          find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types. For example, hypothyroidism with T
          cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements,
          hematological assays with specific blood cell types, plasma lipids
          with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different
          brain cell types. Additionally, as PhenoPLIER can utilize models
          derived from extensive and diverse RNA-seq datasets, we can also
          identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or
          disease states. We note that significant module-trait associations in
          PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) are replicated in the Electronic
          Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III
          [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our
          replication cohort). We also conduct a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid
          regulation in HepG2 cells, noting more robust trait associations with
          modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be
          involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance.
          In comparison to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also
          better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing
          tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the
          mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits
          via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction
          suggests that modules may provide a superior means to examine
          drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Lastly, exploration
          of the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
          with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
          with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act together
          to carry out different functions in specific cell types, rather than
          focusing on single genes associated with different complex traits.
          This approach enhances robustness in detecting and interpreting
          genetic associations, and we demonstrate its ability to prioritize
          alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when
          known single gene associations are not detected. This method signifies
          a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies, with the
          potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations
          to improve our understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic

          [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that
          extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
          preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When
          mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells,
          corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological
          assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose
          tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell
          types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large
          and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
          associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states.
          We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan
          (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records
          and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort).
          Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in
          HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules
          than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be
          involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance.
          Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also
          better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing
          tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the
          mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits
          via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction
          suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine
          drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring
          the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
          with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
          with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In
          summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different
          complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act
          together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This
          approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic
          associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and
          potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single
          gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a
          conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the
          potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations
          to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic
          modalities.

          In the realm of genetic studies, we introduce a novel approach termed
          PhenoPLIER, which utilizes an omnigenic perspective to analyze gene
          modules. This method is flexible, permitting the integration of
          various data types into a unified representation for joint analysis.
          We demonstrate that this approach can deduce the influence of
          functionally-related gene clusters on complex traits, discern shared
          and unique transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict the
          impact of pharmacological perturbations on gene activity. To achieve
          this, PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced
          transcriptional responses into a shared latent representation. This
          process involves integrating thousands of gene-trait associations from
          PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083] and drug transcriptional
          profiles from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049] into a
          low-dimensional space derived from public gene expression data on an
          extensive collection of RNA-seq samples (recount2
          [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We employ a
          matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1;
          @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] to define a latent representation
          that extracts gene modules with specific sparsity constraints and
          preferences for those aligning with prior knowledge. By mapping
          gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we reveal
          significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed
          in relevant cell types. Notably, PhenoPLIER's ability to utilize
          models derived from large, heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets allows the
          identification of modules associated with specific cell types under
          particular stimuli or disease states. We found that significant
          module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan replicated in the Electronic
          Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III
          [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225].
          Furthermore, our module-based approach outperforms a single-gene
          approach in predicting FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing
          tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms associated with drug
          actions. This enhanced drug-disease prediction suggests that modules
          may offer a superior means to investigate drug-disease relationships
          than individual genes. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER represents a paradigm
          shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. By focusing on groups
          of genes that act together within specific cell types, rather than
          single genes associated with complex traits, we improve the robustness
          of detecting and interpreting genetic associations. Our findings
          illustrate how this approach can prioritize alternative and
          potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single
          gene associations are not detected, thereby deepening our
          understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.

          and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort).
          Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in
          HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules
          than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be
          involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance.
          Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also
          better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing
          tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the
          mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits
          via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction
          suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine
          drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring
          the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
          with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
          with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In
          summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different
          complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act
          together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This
          approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic
          associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and
          potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single
          gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a
          conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the
          potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations
          to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic
          modalities.

          In the realm of genetic studies, the need for a method that integrates
          varied data types into a unified analysis is evident (Context). We
          introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that offers a gene module
          perspective, enhancing our understanding of how functionally-related
          genes influence complex traits, and enabling the detection of shared
          and distinct transcriptomic characteristics among traits. By
          integrating thousands of gene-trait associations from PhenomeXcan
          [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083] and drug-induced transcriptional
          profiles from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049] into a
          common latent representation, we can predict how changes in gene
          activity due to pharmacological interventions affect their functions.
          This integration leverages a matrix factorization approach
          [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] to
          extract gene modules that align with prior knowledge (pathways) from a
          low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data. Our
          findings reveal that diseases are significantly associated with gene
          modules expressed in relevant cell types, such as T cells in
          hypothyroidism and different brain cell types in neuropsychiatric
          disorders. Moreover, the use of large RNA-seq datasets allows the
          identification of modules associated with cell types under specific
          conditions or disease states. These findings were replicated in the
          eMERGE network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225]. A CRISPR screen further
          demonstrated more robust trait associations with modules than with
          individual genes, suggesting a better prediction of FDA-approved
          drug-disease links via a module-based approach. This approach revealed
          stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, providing a
          fresh perspective on drug-disease relationships (Content). In sum,
          PhenoPLIER represents a paradigm shift in interpreting genetic
          studies, prioritizing groups of functionally-related genes over
          individual genes. This method improves the robustness of detecting and
          interpreting genetic associations and offers a promising avenue for
          identifying alternative therapeutic targets when known single-gene
          associations are not detected, thereby enhancing our understanding of
          complex diseases and their treatment modalities (Conclusion).

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section.


          Input paragraph: Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach
          that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The
          flexibility of our method allows integrating different data modalities
          into the same representation for a joint analysis. We show that this
          module perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes
          influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic
          properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations
          affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps
          gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses
          into a common latent representation. For this, we integrate thousands
          of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan
          [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs
          (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a
          low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens
          of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
          [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a
          latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach
          [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that
          extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
          preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When
          mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells,
          corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological
          assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose
          tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell
          types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large
          and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
          associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states.
          We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan
          (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records
          and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort).
          Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in
          HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules
          than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be
          involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance.
          Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also
          better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing
          tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the
          mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits
          via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction
          suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine
          drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring
          the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
          with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
          with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In
          summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different
          complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act

          In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach that
          provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. Our method's
          versatility allows the integration of different data types into a
          single representation for a comprehensive analysis. This approach
          enables the inference of how groups of functionally-related genes
          influence complex traits, the identification of shared and unique
          transcriptomic properties among traits, and the prediction of the
          effects of pharmacological perturbations on gene activity. PhenoPLIER
          consolidates gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional
          responses into a shared latent representation by integrating thousands
          of gene-trait associations (utilizing TWAS from PhenomeXcan) and
          transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000) into a
          low-dimensional space derived from public gene expression data on
          numerous RNA-seq samples (recount2). We employ a matrix factorization
          approach to define a latent representation that extracts gene modules
          with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those aligning
          with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait associations
          to this reduced expression space, we find that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types. Importantly, PhenoPLIER can utilize models derived from large
          and diverse RNA-seq datasets, enabling the identification of modules
          associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states.
          We also found that significant module-trait associations in
          PhenomeXcan were replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and
          Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III. Additionally, we performed a
          CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells and found
          more robust trait associations with modules than with individual
          genes. Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method
          also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing
          tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the
          mechanism of action of drugs. This enhanced drug-disease prediction
          suggests that modules may provide a more effective way to examine
          drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Lastly, an
          exploration of the phenotype-module space revealed stable trait
          clusters associated with relevant tissues. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          not only considers individual genes associated with complex traits but
          also incorporates groups of genes that act together in specific cell
          types. This approach enhances the robustness in detecting and
          interpreting genetic associations and can prioritize alternative and
          potentially more promising candidate targets. This method represents a
          significant shift in the interpretation of genetic studies and holds
          the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical
          associations, thereby enhancing our understanding of complex diseases
          and their therapeutic strategies.

          studies that focuses on gene modules (Context). This method allows for
          the integration of different data types into a unified analysis,
          enabling the inference of how groups of related genes influence
          complex traits, the detection of shared and unique transcriptomic
          properties among traits, and the prediction of how drug-induced
          changes affect gene activities. PhenoPLIER achieves this by mapping
          gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses
          into a common latent representation. This is accomplished by
          integrating thousands of gene-trait associations (as identified by
          TWAS from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and
          transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000
          [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space. This
          space is derived from public gene expression data from tens of
          thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
          [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]), using a
          matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1;
          @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that defines a latent representation.
          This representation extracts gene modules with certain sparsity
          constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge
          (pathways). We find that diseases are significantly associated with
          gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. For instance,
          hypothyroidism is associated with T cells, corneal endothelial cells
          with keratometry measurements, and neuropsychiatric disorders with
          different brain cell types. Additionally, PhenoPLIER can identify
          modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease
          states. Using this approach, we have found that significant
          module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) were
          replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE)
          network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort). We also
          performed a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells,
          observing more robust trait associations with modules than with
          individual genes (Content). In conclusion, PhenoPLIER represents a
          shift in the interpretation of genetic studies, moving from
          considering individual genes to focusing on groups of genes that work
          together in specific cell types. This approach enhances our ability to
          detect and interpret genetic associations and prioritize promising
          candidate targets, even when known single gene associations are not
          detected. It offers the potential to extract mechanistic insights from
          statistical associations, thereby improving our understanding of
          complex diseases and their treatment options (Conclusion).

          Input paragraph: Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach
          that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The
          flexibility of our method allows integrating different data modalities
          into the same representation for a joint analysis. We show that this
          module perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes
          influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic
          properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations
          affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps
          gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses
          into a common latent representation. For this, we integrate thousands
          of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan
          [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs
          (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a
          low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens
          of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
          [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a
          latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach
          [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that
          extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
          preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When
          mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells,
          corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological
          assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose
          tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell
          types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large
          and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
          associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states.
          We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan
          (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records
          and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort).
          Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in
          HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules
          than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be
          involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance.
          Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also
          better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing
          tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the
          mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits
          via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction
          suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine
          drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring
          the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
          with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
          with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In
          summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different
          complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act
          together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This
          approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic
          associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and
          potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single
          gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a
          conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the
          potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations
          to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic
          modalities.

          In the realm of genetic studies, a comprehensive understanding of how
          groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits is
          paramount (Context). This paper introduces PhenoPLIER, an innovative
          approach that integrates diverse data sets for a holistic analysis. By
          mapping gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional
          responses into a common latent representation, PhenoPLIER enables the
          inference of how certain gene groups affect complex traits, discerns
          shared and unique transcriptomic properties among traits, and predicts
          how pharmacological interventions impact gene activity. To achieve
          this, we amalgamate thousands of gene-trait associations from
          PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083] and transcriptional profiles
          of drugs from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049] into a

          uses a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1;

          sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior
          knowledge (pathways). We discovered that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, such as
          T cells for hypothyroidism and different brain cell types for
          neuropsychiatric disorders. Additionally, our approach enables the
          identification of modules associated with cell types under specific
          stimuli or disease states. We also found that significant module-trait
          associations in PhenomeXcan replicated in the Electronic Medical
          Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III
          [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225].
          Furthermore, our module-based method outperforms single-gene
          approaches in predicting FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing
          tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms (Content). In
          conclusion, PhenoPLIER represents a paradigm shift in genetic studies
          as it prioritizes groups of genes over individual genes, enhancing the
          robustness of detecting and interpreting genetic associations. This
          approach offers potential in unearthing mechanistic insights from
          statistical associations, thereby improving our understanding of
          complex diseases and their therapeutic strategies (Conclusion).

          In the field of genetic studies, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
          method that adopts an omnigenic approach and focuses on gene modules.
          This method is versatile, enabling the integration of various data
          types into a unified representation for comprehensive analysis. We
          demonstrate that this module-centric approach can deduce how clusters
          of functionally allied genes impact complex traits, discern shared and
          unique transcriptomic characteristics among traits, and predict the
          effect of drug-induced changes on gene activity. PhenoPLIER achieves
          this by mapping gene-trait associations and drug-induced
          transcriptional responses into a shared latent representation. This
          involves integrating thousands of gene-trait associations, sourced
          from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083], and drug
          transcriptional profiles, obtained from LINCS L1000
          [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049], into a low-dimensional space. This
          space is derived from publicly available gene expression data from a
          large number of RNA-seq samples (recount2
          [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We employ a
          matrix factorization approach to define a latent representation
          [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003].
          This approach extracts gene modules under specific sparsity
          constraints and gives preference to those aligned with prior knowledge
          (pathways). Notably, we find that diseases are significantly linked
          with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Furthermore,
          PhenoPLIER can utilize models derived from large and heterogeneous
          RNA-seq datasets to identify modules associated with specific cell
          types under certain stimuli or disease states. We also confirm the
          replication of significant module-trait associations in the eMERGE
          network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225]. Our module-based approach
          outperforms the single-gene approach in predicting FDA-approved
          drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological
          mechanisms linked with the drugs' action mechanisms. This suggests
          that gene modules may provide a more effective way to explore
          drug-disease relationships than individual genes. In conclusion,
          PhenoPLIER represents a paradigm shift in interpreting genetic
          studies. By focusing on gene modules rather than individual genes, it
          enhances the robustness of detecting and interpreting genetic
          associations. This approach could potentially provide deeper insights
          into complex diseases and their treatment strategies by prioritizing
          promising candidate targets, even when known single-gene associations
          are not detected.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section.


          Input paragraph: Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach
          that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The
          flexibility of our method allows integrating different data modalities
          into the same representation for a joint analysis. We show that this
          module perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes
          influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic
          properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations
          affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps
          gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses
          into a common latent representation. For this, we integrate thousands
          of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan
          [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs
          (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a
          low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens
          of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
          [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a
          latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach
          [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that
          extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
          preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When
          mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells,
          corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological
          assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose
          tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell
          types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large
          and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
          associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states.
          We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan
          (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records
          and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort).
          Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in
          HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules
          than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be
          involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance.
          Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also
          better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing
          tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the
          mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits
          via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction
          suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine
          drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring
          the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
          with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
          with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In
          summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different
          complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act
          together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This
          approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic
          associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and
          potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single
          gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a
          conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the
          potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations
          to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic
          modalities.

          In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic method that
          offers a gene module perspective for genetic studies. Our method's
          adaptability facilitates the integration of various data types for a
          unified analysis. Through this module perspective, we can deduce how
          groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits,
          identify shared and unique transcriptomic characteristics among
          traits, and predict the impact of pharmacological interventions on
          gene activity. PhenoPLIER aligns gene-trait associations and
          drug-induced transcriptional responses within a common latent
          representation. We achieve this by integrating thousands of gene-trait
          associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan) and transcriptional
          profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000) into a low-dimensional space
          derived from public gene expression data on numerous RNA-seq samples
          (recount2). We utilize a latent representation defined by a matrix
          factorization approach that extracts gene modules with certain
          sparsity constraints and preferences for those that coincide with
          prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait associations to
          this reduced expression space, we find that diseases are significantly
          associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
          Additionally, PhenoPLIER's ability to use models derived from
          extensive and diverse RNA-seq datasets allows us to identify modules
          associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states.
          We note that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our
          discovery cohort) are replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and
          Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III (our replication cohort). We also
          conduct a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells,
          observing more robust trait associations with modules than with
          individual genes. Our module-based method outperforms a single-gene
          approach in predicting FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing
          tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the drugs'
          mechanism of action. This enhanced drug-disease prediction implies
          that modules may offer a superior method to examine drug-disease
          relationships than individual genes. Exploring the phenotype-module
          space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues,
          including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular,
          autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          considers groups of genes that function together in specific cell
          types, rather than single genes associated with different complex
          traits. This approach enhances the robustness in detecting and
          interpreting genetic associations, and we demonstrate its potential to
          prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate
          targets even when known single gene associations are not detected.
          This represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic
          studies, with the potential to extract mechanistic insight from
          statistical associations, thereby enhancing our understanding of
          complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.

          Input paragraph: Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach
          that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The
          flexibility of our method allows integrating different data modalities
          into the same representation for a joint analysis. We show that this
          module perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes
          influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic
          properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations
          affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps
          gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses
          into a common latent representation. For this, we integrate thousands
          of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan
          [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs
          (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a
          low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens
          of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
          [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a
          latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach
          [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that
          extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
          preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When
          mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we
          observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells,
          corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological
          assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose
          tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell
          types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large
          and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
          associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states.
          We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan
          (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records
          and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort).
          Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in
          HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules
          than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be
          involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance.
          Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also
          better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing
          tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the
          mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits
          via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction
          suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine
          drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring
          the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
          with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
          with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In
          summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different
          complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act
          together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This
          approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic
          associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and
          potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single
          gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a
          conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the
          potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations
          to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic
          modalities.

          In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that offers a
          gene module perspective to genetic studies, thereby enhancing our
          understanding of complex traits and disease etiology (Context). This
          approach leverages the flexibility of integrating different data types
          for a comprehensive analysis, and it maps gene-trait associations and
          drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent
          representation. To achieve this, we incorporate thousands of
          gene-trait associations and drug transcriptional profiles into a
          low-dimensional space derived from public gene expression data on
          numerous RNA-seq samples [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083;
          @doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003;
          @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]. Utilizing a matrix factorization approach, we
          extract gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences
          for those aligning with prior knowledge (pathways)
          [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003]. We
          find that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules
          expressed in relevant cell types, and we can identify modules
          associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states.
          Our findings are replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and
          Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (Content). Furthermore, our
          module-based approach outperforms a single-gene approach in predicting
          FDA-approved drug-disease links, suggesting that modules may provide a
          better means to examine drug-disease relationships. This approach also
          reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues,
          offering insights into the clustering of complex traits. In essence,
          PhenoPLIER emphasizes the collective action of gene groups in specific
          cell types over individual genes in interpreting genetic associations,
          providing a potential avenue for identifying promising therapeutic
          targets and understanding drug mechanisms (Conclusion). This
          represents a paradigm shift in the interpretation of genetic studies,
          with the potential to derive mechanistic insights from statistical
          associations, thereby advancing our understanding of complex diseases
          and their therapeutic modalities.

          In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel omnigenic methodology
          that employs a gene module perspective in genetic research (Context).
          This innovative approach allows for the integration of varying data
          types into a unified representation for comprehensive analysis. By
          mapping gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional
          responses into a shared latent representation, PhenoPLIER can discern
          how groups of functionally related genes impact complex traits,
          identify shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits,
          and predict the effects of pharmacological interventions on gene
          activity. This is achieved by integrating thousands of gene-trait
          associations from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083] and
          transcriptional profiles of drugs from LINCS L1000
          [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049] into a low-dimensional space derived
          from public gene expression data from a large number of RNA-seq
          samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003;
          @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). This latent representation is defined by a
          matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1;
          @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with
          specific sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align
          with prior knowledge (pathways). Notably, we found that diseases are
          significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell
          types, such as T cells in hypothyroidism and different brain cell
          types in neuropsychiatric disorders. Moreover, PhenoPLIER's ability to
          use models derived from large and diverse RNA-seq datasets allows us
          to identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli
          or disease states. Our findings in PhenomeXcan were replicated in the
          Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III
          [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225], and we
          further validated our results via a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid
          regulation in HepG2 cells (Content). In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
          represents a significant shift in the interpretation of genetic
          studies, moving away from individual genes to groups of genes that
          work collectively within specific cell types. Our approach not only
          enhances the robustness of detecting and interpreting genetic
          associations but also allows for the prioritization of alternative and
          potentially more promising candidate targets when known single gene
          associations are not detected. This potential to extract mechanistic
          insights from statistical associations can greatly improve our
          understanding of complex diseases and their treatment modalities
          (Conclusion).

              In the intricate world of genetics, genes do not operate in

              These interactions can be altered by variations in the genes

              Genes cooperate within specialized networks to execute various
              functions, a process that can be influenced by genetic variations

              genes' operational roles and consequently impact biological
              processes related to diseases. To comprehend how genes contribute
              to complex traits, it is essential to understand the regulation of
              gene expression across diverse cell types

              integration of functional genomics data and Genome-Wide

              @doi:10.1038/ncomms6890]. When these mechanisms are disrupted,
              they often lead to disease conditions specific to certain tissues

              Genes operate collectively within specific networks to perform
              various functions, a dynamic that is influenced by genetic
              variations [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259;

              roles of individual genes and, on a broader scale, impact
              biological processes related to disease. Understanding how genes
              contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic
              comprehension of gene expression regulation across diverse cell
              types [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;

              integration of functional genomics data with Genome-Wide

              variations and gene expression regulation across different cell
              types, a gap in knowledge that this manuscript aims to address.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining
              the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the
              following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance
              clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The
              revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a
              Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure
              begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context),
              progresses through what is known from the literature (Content),
              and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap your
              manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1)
              preserve the original information as much as possible, with
              minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to
              scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the
              original text. These references are crucial for academic integrity
              and may appear in formats like "[@pmid:33931583;

              revised paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following
              the C-C-C structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.

              functions, and alterations in these genes can modify their roles
              and impact biological processes related to diseases

              complex traits, it's essential to comprehend how gene expression
              is regulated across different cell types. This knowledge can
              potentially lead to the development of improved treatments

              integration of functional genomics data with Genome-Wide
              Association Studies (GWAS) data has enhanced the identification of
              transcriptional mechanisms. When these mechanisms are disrupted,
              they often lead to pathology specific to certain tissues and cell

              interactions and their implications for disease treatment and drug
              development.

              With the widespread availability of gene expression data across
              numerous tissues, an effective approach to identifying biological
              processes is through transcription-wide association studies (TWAS)
              [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;

              These studies integrate expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
              data, providing a mechanistic interpretation of GWAS findings. The
              basis of TWAS is to test whether perturbations in gene regulatory
              mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and
              human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;
              @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889;
              @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This approach has proven highly successful,
              not only in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome
              level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;
              @pmid:31036433] but also in predicting disease risk (using
              polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and
              repurposing drugs [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. However, a limitation of
              TWAS is that it operates at the individual gene level, thereby
              failing to capture more complex interactions at the network level.

              The advent of gene expression data across various tissues has
              offered a wealth of resources for understanding biological
              processes [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;

              (Context). A popular tool to decipher these processes is the
              transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which amalgamates
              expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide
              insights into the mechanisms behind genome-wide association study
              (GWAS) results. Essentially, TWAS investigates if alterations in
              gene regulation mediate the link between genetic variations and
              human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;

              [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] (Content). However, the current TWAS model
              focuses on individual genes, thereby overlooking potential
              intricate interactions at the network level, a gap that our
              manuscript aims to address (Conclusion).

              Among the methods developed to leverage this data, the

              TWAS integrates data on expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
              to provide mechanistic explanations for findings from genome-wide
              association studies (GWAS). It does so by examining the potential

              With the accessibility of gene expression data across various
              tissues, the transcription-wide association study (TWAS) presents
              an effective approach to identify these biological processes. This
              approach integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
              data, providing a mechanistic interpretation for Genome-Wide
              Association Study (GWAS) findings. TWAS is dependent on the
              testing of whether disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms
              mediate the association between genetic variants and human
              diseases. These methods have proven highly effective not only in
              understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level, but
              also in predicting disease risk through polygenic scores and in
              drug repurposing tasks. However, it should be noted that TWAS
              operates at the individual gene level, which does not account for
              more complex interactions at the network level.

              prominent method to explore these biological processes is the
              Transcription-Wide Association Study (TWAS), which leverages
              expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to interpret the
              findings of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)
              mechanistically. This method investigates the role of gene
              regulatory disruptions in mediating the relationship between

              [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. Despite these successes, a limitation of
              TWAS is its focus on individual genes, which overlooks potential
              complex interactions at the network level. This paper addresses
              this gap by exploring the implications of such network-level
              interactions.

              With the broad availability of gene expression data across various
              tissues, the transcription-wide association study (TWAS) has
              emerged as an effective approach for identifying biological
              processes. This method integrates expression quantitative trait
              loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic interpretation of
              Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) findings. The TWAS approach
              tests whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate
              the relationship between genetic variants and human diseases.
              These strategies have proven highly successful, not only in
              comprehending disease etiology at the transcriptome level but also
              in predicting disease risk (through polygenic scores) and in tasks
              related to drug repurposing. However, a limitation of TWAS is its
              focus on the individual gene level, which overlooks more complex
              interactions occurring at the network level.

              One such methodology is the transcription-wide association study
              (TWAS), a powerful tool that combines expression quantitative
              trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer mechanistic insights into the
              results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This approach
              tests the hypothesis that alterations in gene regulation
              mechanisms could explain the association between genetic variants
              and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;

              elucidating disease origins at the transcriptome level
              [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;

              [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. Despite these successes, there is an unmet
              need to extend the scope of TWAS beyond the individual gene level
              to capture more complex interactions at the network level.

              A vast amount of gene expression data across various tissues is
              now readily available [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;

              processes within this data, scientists have been using a method
              called a transcription-wide association study (TWAS). This
              approach combines data from expression quantitative trait loci
              (eQTLs) to provide a mechanistic explanation for the results of
              genome-wide association studies (GWAS). TWAS methods test if
              disturbances in gene regulation are the link between genetic

              deepened our understanding of disease causality at the

              focus on individual genes, which overlooks the potential for more
              intricate interactions at the network level.

              Transcription-Wide Association Studies (TWAS) are predicated on
              the testing of whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms
              mediate the association between genetic variants and human
              diseases. These approaches have proven highly successful in not
              only understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level,
              but also in predicting disease risk through polygenic scores, and
              in drug repurposing tasks. With the availability of gene
              expression data across numerous tissues, TWAS has emerged as an
              effective method for identifying these biological processes. It
              does so by integrating Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTLs)
              data, providing a mechanistic interpretation for Genome-Wide
              Association Study (GWAS) findings. However, it's important to note
              that TWAS operates at the individual gene level, and therefore

              The field of genetics has relied significantly on
              Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies (TWAS) to examine how
              changes in gene regulation could explain the link between genetic
              variations and human diseases[@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;

              @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889]. This approach has proven
              successful not only in illuminating the causes of diseases at the
              transcriptome level[@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433], but also in

              scores[@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and identifying new uses
              for existing drugs[@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. The widespread
              availability of gene expression data across various tissues has
              made TWAS an effective tool for discerning these biological
              processes[@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;

              However, a critical limitation of TWAS is its focus on individual
              genes, which obscures the more complex interactions that occur at
              the network level. This manuscript aims to address this knowledge

              Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) are reliant on the
              evaluation of whether disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms
              serve as a mediator in the relationship between genetic variants
              and human diseases. This methodology has proven to be highly
              effective in not only understanding the etiology of diseases at
              the transcriptome level, but also in predicting disease risk
              through polygenic scores and in tasks related to drug repurposing.
              With the availability of gene expression data across numerous
              tissues, TWAS provides an efficient approach to identifying these
              biological processes. This method integrates expression
              quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data, thereby providing a
              mechanistic interpretation of genome-wide association studies
              (GWAS) findings. However, it should be noted that TWAS operates at
              the individual gene level and may not fully capture the complexity
              of interactions occurring at the network level.

              The exploration of genetic associations with human diseases often
              involves investigating disruptions in gene regulation mechanisms,
              a process facilitated by transcription-wide association studies

              studies have significantly contributed to our understanding of
              disease origins at the level of gene expression, or the
              transcriptome [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;

              [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and in identifying potential new
              uses for existing drugs, a practice known as drug repurposing
              [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. The growing accessibility of gene
              expression data from various tissues further enhances the utility

              However, a limitation of current TWAS approaches is that they
              typically focus on individual genes, thereby overlooking the
              potentially more complex relationships that exist at the network
              level. This manuscript addresses this gap by exploring the role of

              Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) are based on testing
              the extent to which perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms
              mediate the correlation between genetic variants and human
              diseases. This approach has proven highly successful in not only
              understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level, but
              also in predicting disease risk using polygenic scores, and in
              drug repurposing tasks. With the wide availability of gene
              expression data across numerous tissues, TWAS emerges as an
              effective method to identify these biological processes. This
              approach integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
              data, providing a mechanistic interpretation for genome-wide

              Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies (TWAS) are a powerful tool
              for exploring the links between genetic variations and human
              diseases by examining disruptions in gene regulation

              interactions that occur at the network level. This highlights a
              knowledge gap that necessitates further research to enhance our

              exploration is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS),
              which utilizes expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to
              offer mechanistic insights into the findings of genome-wide
              association studies (GWAS). Despite its effectiveness, TWAS
              primarily operates at the level of individual genes, and thus,
              fails to encapsulate the complexity of network-level interactions.
              This method is based on the principle of testing whether changes
              in gene regulation mechanisms mediate the relationship between
              genetic variants and human diseases

              remains an unaddressed need for methods that can capture the
              intricate interactions at the network level, a gap that our

              In the era of abundant gene expression data across various tissues

              the transcription-wide association study (TWAS) has emerged as an
              effective tool for identifying biological processes. TWAS
              integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to
              offer mechanistic explanations for genetic findings associated
              with diseases. Despite its effectiveness, TWAS operates on an
              individual gene level, thus not fully encompassing the intricate
              interactions that occur at the network level. TWAS's methodology
              hinges on testing if disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms
              serve as a bridge between genetic variations and human diseases
              [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;

              approach has been notably successful in not only deepening our
              understanding of disease causation at the transcriptome level

              [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. Despite these achievements, there remains
              a gap in capturing complex gene interactions at the network level,
              which our manuscript aims to address.

              to provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the
              associations found in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This
              powerful tool operates by investigating whether changes in gene

              that it operates at the level of individual genes, thereby
              overlooking potentially significant, complex interactions at the
              network level.

              The broad availability of gene expression data across various
              tissues has opened new avenues for understanding biological
              processes [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;

              (Context). One of the effective methods used to identify these
              processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS). TWAS
              uses expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a
              mechanistic explanation for findings from genome-wide association
              studies (GWAS). It operates by testing if changes in gene
              regulatory processes mediate the relationship between genetic
              variations and human diseases. This approach has been tremendously
              successful in both understanding disease origins at the
              transcriptome level and predicting disease risk using polygenic
              scores. It has also found applications in drug repurposing
              [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;

              Nevertheless, TWAS primarily focuses on individual genes, which
              limits its ability to capture more intricate interactions
              occurring at the network level (Conclusion).

              The abundance of gene expression data across various tissues has
              become readily accessible in recent times [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
              @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
              @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. This wealth of information has
              given rise to a powerful tool known as the transcription-wide
              association study (TWAS). TWAS utilizes expression quantitative
              trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer mechanistic explanations for
              findings from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This method
              has been instrumental in elucidating disease origins at the
              transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;

              [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. However, a limitation of TWAS is that it
              operates at the level of individual genes, thereby failing to
              capture more intricate interactions at the network level. This
              suggests a potential gap in our understanding of how genetic
              variations influence human diseases, highlighting the need for
              methods that can capture these complex network-level interactions.

              tissues has paved the way for advanced biological process
              identification [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
              @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
              @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. A commonly employed method for
              this purpose is the Transcription-Wide Association Study (TWAS).
              This approach utilizes expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
              data to offer mechanistic explanations for findings from
              genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Despite its effectiveness,
              TWAS primarily operates at the individual gene level, failing to
              account for more intricate network-level interactions. The method
              hinges on testing if alterations in gene regulation mechanisms
              serve as a conduit between genetic variants and human diseases
              [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
              @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This
              approach has been instrumental in deciphering disease origins at
              the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433], predicting
              disease risk (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w],
              and repurposing drugs [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. However, there is a
              pressing need to enhance the scope of TWAS to encapsulate
              network-level interactions, thereby enriching our understanding of
              complex biological processes and disease mechanisms.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining
              the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the
              following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance
              clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The
              revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a
              Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure
              begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context),
              progresses through what is known from the literature (Content),
              and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap your
              manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1)
              preserve the original information as much as possible, with
              minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to
              scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the
              original text. These references are crucial for academic integrity

              In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach that
              offers a gene module perspective for genetic studies. Our method's
              flexibility enables the integration of various data types into a
              unified representation for combined analysis. We demonstrate that
              this module perspective can deduce how clusters of
              functionally-related genes affect complex traits, identify shared
              and unique transcriptomic characteristics among traits, and
              predict the impact of pharmacological interventions on gene
              activity. PhenoPLIER consolidates gene-trait associations and
              drug-induced transcriptional responses into a shared latent
              representation. To achieve this, we incorporate thousands of
              gene-trait associations (sourced from PhenomeXcan's TWAS
              [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of
              drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a
              low-dimensional space derived from public gene expression data of
              tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
              [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We
              employ a latent representation, defined by a matrix factorization
              approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1;
              @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003], that extracts gene modules with
              specific sparsity constraints and preferences for those aligning
              with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait
              associations to this reduced expression space, we find that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. For example, hypothyroidism with T cells,
              corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements,
              hematological assays with specific blood cell types, plasma lipids
              with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different
              brain cell types. Additionally, as PhenoPLIER can utilize models
              derived from extensive and diverse RNA-seq datasets, we can also
              identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli
              or disease states. We note that significant module-trait
              associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) are replicated
              in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network
              phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort). We
              also conduct a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2
              cells, noting more robust trait associations with modules than
              with individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved
              in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance. In
              comparison to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also
              better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing
              tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the
              mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular
              traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease
              prediction suggests that modules may provide a superior means to
              examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Lastly,
              exploration of the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait
              clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex
              branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and
              neuropsychiatric disorders. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER incorporates
              groups of genes that act together to carry out different functions
              in specific cell types, rather than focusing on single genes
              associated with different complex traits. This approach enhances
              robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and
              we demonstrate its ability to prioritize alternative and
              potentially more promising candidate targets even when known
              single gene associations are not detected. This method signifies a
              conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies, with
              the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical
              associations to improve our understanding of complex diseases and
              their therapeutic modalities.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining
              the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the
              following paragraph from the Introduction section.


              Input paragraph: Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach
              that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The
              flexibility of our method allows integrating different data
              modalities into the same representation for a joint analysis. We
              show that this module perspective can infer how groups of
              functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared
              and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict
              how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert
              their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and
              drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent
              representation. For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait
              associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan
              [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of
              drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a
              low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on
              tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
              [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use
              a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach
              [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003]
              that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
              preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways).
              When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression
              space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as
              hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with
              keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood
              cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and
              neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types.
              Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and
              heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
              associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease
              states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in
              PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic
              Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III
              [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our
              replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust
              trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even
              when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not
              reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene
              approach, our module-based method also better predicts
              FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific
              pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action
              of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known
              immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests
              that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease
              relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the
              phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
              with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
              with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders.
              In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with
              different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes
              that act together to carry out different functions in specific
              cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and
              interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can
              prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate
              targets even when known single gene associations are not detected.
              The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation
              of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract mechanistic
              insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding
              of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.

              In the context of genetic studies, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a
              comprehensive method that adopts a modular approach to
              understanding gene function and interaction. Our method combines
              various data types for a unified analysis, enabling the inference
              of how functionally-linked gene groups influence complex traits,
              the identification of shared and distinct transcriptomic
              characteristics among these traits, and the prediction of how drug
              interventions impact gene activity. PhenoPLIER achieves this by
              mapping gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional
              responses into a shared latent representation, integrating
              thousands of gene-trait associations from PhenomeXcan
              [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083] and drug transcriptional profiles
              from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049] into a
              low-dimensional space derived from extensive public gene
              expression data [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003;
              @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]. This latent representation, defined by a
              matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1;
              @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003], extracts gene modules under
              specific constraints, favoring those that align with established
              knowledge. We find that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Additionally, our
              approach allows for the identification of modules linked with cell
              types under specific conditions or disease states. Importantly, we
              find that our module-trait associations replicated in the eMERGE
              network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225], and that our module-based
              method outperforms single-gene approaches in predicting
              FDA-approved drug-disease associations, suggesting that modules
              may be a superior means to explore drug-disease relationships.
              Finally, we reveal stable trait clusters associated with relevant
              tissues, indicating a complex relationship between lipids and
              cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In
              conclusion, PhenoPLIER represents a paradigm shift in the
              interpretation of genetic studies, focusing on groups of genes
              that work together within specific cell types. This approach
              enhances the robustness of detecting and interpreting genetic

              Input paragraph: Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach
              that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The
              flexibility of our method allows integrating different data
              modalities into the same representation for a joint analysis. We
              show that this module perspective can infer how groups of
              functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared
              and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict
              how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert
              their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and
              drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent
              representation. For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait
              associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan
              [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of
              drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a
              low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on
              tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
              [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use
              a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach
              [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003]
              that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
              preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways).
              When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression
              space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as
              hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with
              keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood
              cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and
              neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types.
              Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and
              heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
              associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease
              states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in
              PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic
              Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III
              [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our
              replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust
              trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even
              when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not
              reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene
              approach, our module-based method also better predicts
              FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific
              pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action
              of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known
              immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests
              that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease
              relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the
              phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
              with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
              with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders.
              In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with
              different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes
              that act together to carry out different functions in specific
              cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and
              interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can
              prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate
              targets even when known single gene associations are not detected.
              The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation
              of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract mechanistic
              insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding
              of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.

              In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel method for genetic
              analysis that offers a comprehensive view of gene modules, or
              groups of functionally-related genes, and their influence on
              complex traits (Context). Our approach incorporates different data
              types into a unified analysis, allowing us to discern shared and
              unique transcriptomic properties among traits and predict the
              impact of drug interventions on gene activity. PhenoPLIER achieves
              this by mapping gene-trait associations and drug-induced
              transcriptional responses into a common representation. This is
              accomplished by integrating thousands of gene-trait associations
              from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083] and drug
              transcriptional profiles from LINCS L1000
              [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049] into a low-dimensional space
              derived from public gene expression data on numerous RNA-seq
              samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003;
              @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We utilize a latent representation
              defined by a matrix factorization approach
              [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003]
              that identifies gene modules under certain constraints and
              preferences for those that align with established knowledge
              (pathways). Our results demonstrate that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and we can identify modules associated with cell types
              in specific disease states or under particular stimuli. Our
              findings using PhenoPLIER were replicated in the Electronic
              Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III
              [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225]. We
              also conducted a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in
              HepG2 cells, further validating our module-based approach.
              Notably, PhenoPLIER outperformed single-gene methods in predicting
              FDA-approved drug-disease links, suggesting that gene modules may
              offer a more effective way to examine drug-disease relationships
              (Content). In conclusion, PhenoPLIER represents a significant
              advancement in genetic studies by focusing on gene modules rather
              than individual genes. This approach enhances the robustness of
              detecting and interpreting genetic associations and can highlight
              alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets, even
              when known single gene associations are not detected. This
              innovation could lead to a deeper understanding of complex
              diseases and their therapeutic options, signifying a paradigm
              shift in genetic research (Conclusion).

              In this paper, we introduce PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic tool that
              brings a gene module perspective to genetic research. Our method
              is flexible and capable of integrating different data types into
              one representation for a comprehensive analysis. We demonstrate
              that this module perspective can deduce how clusters of
              functionally-related genes affect complex traits, identify shared
              and unique transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict the
              influence of pharmacological interventions on gene activity.
              PhenoPLIER aligns gene-trait associations and drug-induced
              transcriptional responses in a shared latent representation. To
              accomplish this, we incorporate thousands of gene-trait
              associations (utilizing TWAS from PhenomeXcan) and transcriptional
              profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000) into a low-dimensional space,
              derived from publicly available gene expression data from tens of
              thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2). We employ a latent
              representation defined by a matrix factorization approach that
              isolates gene modules with specific sparsity constraints and
              preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways).
              When mapping gene-trait associations to this compressed expression
              space, we note that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, such as T cells
              with hypothyroidism, and corneal endothelial cells with
              keratometry measurements, among others. Notably, PhenoPLIER can
              utilize models derived from large and diverse RNA-seq datasets,
              allowing us to also identify modules associated with cell types
              under specific stimuli or disease conditions. We found that
              significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our
              discovery cohort) were replicated in the Electronic Medical
              Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III (our replication
              cohort). Additionally, we conducted a CRISPR screen to analyze
              lipid regulation in HepG2 cells, observing that trait associations
              were more robust with modules than with individual genes. Compared
              to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also predicts
              FDA-approved drug-disease links more accurately by capturing
              tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the
              drugs' mechanism of action. This suggests that modules may be more
              effective in examining drug-disease relationships than individual
              genes. Finally, our exploration of the phenotype-module space
              revealed stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues.
              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER offers a novel approach in interpreting
              genetic studies by focusing on groups of genes that work together
              in specific cell types rather than individual genes. This approach
              enhances the robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic
              associations, and we demonstrate its potential in prioritizing
              alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets, even
              when known single gene associations are not detected. This
              represents a significant shift in the interpretation of genetic
              studies and has the potential to provide mechanistic insights from
              statistical associations, thereby enhancing our understanding of
              complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining
              the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the
              following paragraph from the Introduction section.


              Input paragraph: Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach
              that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The
              flexibility of our method allows integrating different data
              modalities into the same representation for a joint analysis. We
              show that this module perspective can infer how groups of
              functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared
              and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict
              how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert
              their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and
              drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent
              representation. For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait
              associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan
              [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of
              drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a
              low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on
              tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
              [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use
              a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach
              [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003]
              that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
              preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways).
              When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression
              space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as
              hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with
              keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood
              cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and
              neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types.
              Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and
              heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
              associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease
              states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in
              PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic
              Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III
              [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our
              replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust
              trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even
              when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not
              reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene
              approach, our module-based method also better predicts
              FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific
              pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action
              of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known
              immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests
              that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease
              relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the
              phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
              with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
              with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders.
              In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with
              different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes
              that act together to carry out different functions in specific
              cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and
              interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can
              prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate
              targets even when known single gene associations are not detected.
              The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation
              of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract mechanistic
              insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding
              of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.

              In the realm of genetic studies, the need for a method that
              integrates varied data types into a unified analysis is evident
              (Context). We introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that offers a
              gene module perspective, enhancing our understanding of how
              functionally-related genes influence complex traits, and enabling
              the detection of shared and distinct transcriptomic
              characteristics among traits. By integrating thousands of
              gene-trait associations from PhenomeXcan
              [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083] and drug-induced transcriptional
              profiles from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049] into a
              common latent representation, we can predict how changes in gene
              activity due to pharmacological interventions affect their
              functions. This integration leverages a matrix factorization
              approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1;
              @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] to extract gene modules that
              align with prior knowledge (pathways) from a low-dimensional space
              learned from public gene expression data. Our findings reveal that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types, such as T cells in hypothyroidism and
              different brain cell types in neuropsychiatric disorders.
              Moreover, the use of large RNA-seq datasets allows the
              identification of modules associated with cell types under
              specific conditions or disease states. These findings were
              replicated in the eMERGE network phase III
              [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225]. A
              CRISPR screen further demonstrated more robust trait associations
              with modules than with individual genes, suggesting a better
              prediction of FDA-approved drug-disease links via a module-based
              approach. This approach revealed stable trait clusters associated
              with relevant tissues, providing a fresh perspective on
              drug-disease relationships (Content). In sum, PhenoPLIER
              represents a paradigm shift in interpreting genetic studies,
              prioritizing groups of functionally-related genes over individual
              genes. This method improves the robustness of detecting and
              interpreting genetic associations and offers a promising avenue
              for identifying alternative therapeutic targets when known
              single-gene associations are not detected, thereby enhancing our
              understanding of complex diseases and their treatment modalities
              (Conclusion).

              In the realm of genetic studies, we introduce a novel approach
              termed PhenoPLIER, which utilizes an omnigenic perspective to
              analyze gene modules. This method is flexible, permitting the
              integration of various data types into a unified representation
              for joint analysis. We demonstrate that this approach can deduce
              the influence of functionally-related gene clusters on complex
              traits, discern shared and unique transcriptomic properties among
              traits, and predict the impact of pharmacological perturbations on
              gene activity. To achieve this, PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait
              associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a
              shared latent representation. This process involves integrating
              thousands of gene-trait associations from PhenomeXcan
              [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083] and drug transcriptional profiles

              to define a latent representation that extracts gene modules with
              specific sparsity constraints and preferences for those aligning
              with prior knowledge. By mapping gene-trait associations to this
              reduced expression space, we reveal significant associations
              between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell
              types. Notably, PhenoPLIER's ability to utilize models derived
              from large, heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets allows the
              identification of modules associated with specific cell types
              under particular stimuli or disease states. We found that
              significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan replicated in
              the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase
              III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225].
              Furthermore, our module-based approach outperforms a single-gene
              approach in predicting FDA-approved drug-disease links by
              capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms associated
              with drug actions. This enhanced drug-disease prediction suggests
              that modules may offer a superior means to investigate
              drug-disease relationships than individual genes. In conclusion,
              PhenoPLIER represents a paradigm shift in the interpretation of
              genetic studies. By focusing on groups of genes that act together
              within specific cell types, rather than single genes associated
              with complex traits, we improve the robustness of detecting and
              interpreting genetic associations. Our findings illustrate how
              this approach can prioritize alternative and potentially more
              promising candidate targets even when known single gene
              associations are not detected, thereby deepening our understanding
              of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.

              Input paragraph: Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach
              that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The
              flexibility of our method allows integrating different data
              modalities into the same representation for a joint analysis. We
              show that this module perspective can infer how groups of
              functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared
              and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict
              how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert
              their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and
              drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent
              representation. For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait
              associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan
              [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of
              drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a
              low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on
              tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
              [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use
              a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach
              [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003]
              that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
              preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways).
              When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression
              space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as
              hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with
              keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood
              cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and
              neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types.
              Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and
              heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
              associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease
              states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in
              PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic
              Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III
              [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our
              replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust
              trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even
              when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not
              reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene
              approach, our module-based method also better predicts
              FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific
              pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action
              of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known
              immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests
              that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease
              relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the
              phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
              with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
              with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders.
              In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with
              different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes
              that act together to carry out different functions in specific
              cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and
              interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can
              prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate
              targets even when known single gene associations are not detected.
              The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation
              of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract mechanistic
              insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding
              of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.

            Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation
            in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with

              In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic method that
              offers a gene module perspective for genetic studies. Our approach
              is flexible, allowing for the integration of various data
              modalities into a unified representation for joint analysis. We
              demonstrate that this module perspective can infer the influence
              of functionally-related gene groups on complex traits, identify
              shared and unique transcriptomic properties among traits, and
              predict the impact of pharmacological perturbations on gene
              activity. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced
              transcriptional responses into a shared latent representation. To
              achieve this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations
              (sourced from PhenomeXcan's TWAS [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083])
              and drug transcriptional profiles (from LINCS L1000
              [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space.
              This space is derived from public gene expression data on tens of
              thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
              [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). Our
              latent representation is defined by a matrix factorization
              approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1;
              @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with
              specific sparsity constraints and preferences for those aligning
              with prior knowledge (pathways). In mapping gene-trait
              associations to this reduced expression space, we find significant
              associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types. Additionally, PhenoPLIER's capability to
              utilize models derived from large and diverse RNA-seq datasets
              allows us to identify modules associated with specific cell types
              under particular stimuli or disease states. We find that
              significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our
              discovery cohort) are replicated in the Electronic Medical Records
              and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort). We
              also conduct a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2
              cells, observing more robust trait associations with modules than
              with individual genes. Our module-based method outperforms a
              single-gene approach in predicting FDA-approved drug-disease links

              groups of genes that act synergistically to perform different
              functions in specific cell types, rather than considering
              individual genes associated with different complex traits. This
              approach enhances the robustness in detecting and interpreting
              genetic associations, and we demonstrate how it can prioritize
              alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even

              targets even when known single gene associations are not detected.
              The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation

              In this paper, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel approach to
              genetic studies that focuses on gene modules (Context). This
              method allows for the integration of different data types into a
              unified analysis, enabling the inference of how groups of related
              genes influence complex traits, the detection of shared and unique
              transcriptomic properties among traits, and the prediction of how
              drug-induced changes affect gene activities. PhenoPLIER achieves
              this by mapping gene-trait associations and drug-induced
              transcriptional responses into a common latent representation.
              This is accomplished by integrating thousands of gene-trait
              associations (as identified by TWAS from PhenomeXcan
              [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of
              drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a
              low-dimensional space. This space is derived from public gene
              expression data from tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples
              (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003;
              @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]), using a matrix factorization approach
              [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003]
              that defines a latent representation. This representation extracts
              gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for
              those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). We find that
              diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. For instance, hypothyroidism is associated
              with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry
              measurements, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain
              cell types. Additionally, PhenoPLIER can identify modules
              associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease
              states. Using this approach, we have found that significant
              module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort)
              were replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics
              (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort). We
              also performed a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in
              HepG2 cells, observing more robust trait associations with modules
              than with individual genes (Content). In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
              represents a shift in the interpretation of genetic studies,
              moving from considering individual genes to focusing on groups of
              genes that work together in specific cell types. This approach
              enhances our ability to detect and interpret genetic associations
              and prioritize promising candidate targets, even when known single
              gene associations are not detected. It offers the potential to
              extract mechanistic insights from statistical associations,
              thereby improving our understanding of complex diseases and their
              treatment options (Conclusion).

              a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach
              [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003]
              that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
              preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways).
              When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression
              space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as
              hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with
              keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood
              cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and
              neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types.
              Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and
              heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
              associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease
              states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in
              PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic

              replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust
              trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even
              when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not
              reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene
              approach, our module-based method also better predicts
              FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific
              pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action
              of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known
              immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests
              that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease
              relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the
              phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
              with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
              with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders.
              In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with
              different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes
              that act together to carry out different functions in specific
              cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and

              In the field of genetic studies, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel
              method that adopts an omnigenic approach and focuses on gene
              modules. This method is versatile, enabling the integration of
              various data types into a unified representation for comprehensive
              analysis. We demonstrate that this module-centric approach can
              deduce how clusters of functionally allied genes impact complex
              traits, discern shared and unique transcriptomic characteristics
              among traits, and predict the effect of drug-induced changes on
              gene activity. PhenoPLIER achieves this by mapping gene-trait
              associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a
              shared latent representation. This involves integrating thousands
              of gene-trait associations, sourced from PhenomeXcan
              [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083], and drug transcriptional profiles,
              obtained from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049], into
              a low-dimensional space. This space is derived from publicly
              available gene expression data from a large number of RNA-seq
              samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003;
              @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We employ a matrix factorization approach
              to define a latent representation [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1;
              @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003]. This approach extracts gene
              modules under specific sparsity constraints and gives preference
              to those aligned with prior knowledge (pathways). Notably, we find
              that diseases are significantly linked with gene modules expressed
              in relevant cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER can utilize models
              derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets to identify
              modules associated with specific cell types under certain stimuli
              or disease states. We also confirm the replication of significant
              module-trait associations in the eMERGE network phase III
              [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225]. Our
              module-based approach outperforms the single-gene approach in
              predicting FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing
              tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the
              drugs' action mechanisms. This suggests that gene modules may
              provide a more effective way to explore drug-disease relationships
              than individual genes. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER represents a
              paradigm shift in interpreting genetic studies. By focusing on
              gene modules rather than individual genes, it enhances the
              robustness of detecting and interpreting genetic associations.
              This approach could potentially provide deeper insights into
              complex diseases and their treatment strategies by prioritizing
              promising candidate targets, even when known single-gene
              associations are not detected.

            Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach that provides a
            gene module perspective to genetic studies. The flexibility of our
            method allows integrating different data modalities into the same
            representation for a joint analysis. We show that this module
            perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes
            influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic
            properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological
            perturbations affect genes' activity to exert their effects.
            PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced
            transcriptional responses into a common latent representation. For
            this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations (using TWAS
            from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional
            profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000
            [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space
            learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of
            RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003;
            @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a latent representation defined by a
            matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1;
            @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with
            certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align
            with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait
            associations to this reduced expression space, we observe that
            diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
            relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal
            endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological
            assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose
            tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell
            types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large
            and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
            associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states.
            We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan
            (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records
            and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72;
            @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort).
            Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation
            in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with
            modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to
            be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide
            significance. Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based
            method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by
            capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with
            the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular
            traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease
            prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to
            examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally,
            exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters
            associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch
            involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and
            neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, instead of considering
            single genes associated with different complex traits, PhenoPLIER
            incorporates groups of genes that act together to carry out
            different functions in specific cell types. This approach improves
            robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and
            here we show how it can prioritize alternative and potentially more
            promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations
            are not detected. The approach represents a conceptual shift in the
            interpretation of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract
            mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance the
            understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.

              In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach that
              provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. Our
              method's versatility allows the integration of different data
              types into a single representation for a comprehensive analysis.
              This approach enables the inference of how groups of
              functionally-related genes influence complex traits, the
              identification of shared and unique transcriptomic properties
              among traits, and the prediction of the effects of pharmacological
              perturbations on gene activity. PhenoPLIER consolidates gene-trait
              associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a
              shared latent representation by integrating thousands of
              gene-trait associations (utilizing TWAS from PhenomeXcan) and
              transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000) into a
              low-dimensional space derived from public gene expression data on
              numerous RNA-seq samples (recount2). We employ a matrix
              factorization approach to define a latent representation that
              extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
              preferences for those aligning with prior knowledge (pathways).
              When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression
              space, we find that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types. Importantly,
              PhenoPLIER can utilize models derived from large and diverse
              RNA-seq datasets, enabling the identification of modules
              associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease
              states. We also found that significant module-trait associations
              in PhenomeXcan were replicated in the Electronic Medical Records
              and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III. Additionally, we
              performed a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2
              cells and found more robust trait associations with modules than
              with individual genes. Compared to a single-gene approach, our
              module-based method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease
              links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms
              linked with the mechanism of action of drugs. This enhanced
              drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a more
              effective way to examine drug-disease relationships than
              individual genes. Lastly, an exploration of the phenotype-module
              space revealed stable trait clusters associated with relevant
              tissues. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER not only considers individual
              genes associated with complex traits but also incorporates groups
              of genes that act together in specific cell types. This approach
              enhances the robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic
              associations and can prioritize alternative and potentially more
              promising candidate targets. This method represents a significant
              shift in the interpretation of genetic studies and holds the
              potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical
              associations, thereby enhancing our understanding of complex
              diseases and their therapeutic strategies.

              Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and

              In the realm of genetic studies, a comprehensive understanding of
              how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits
              is paramount (Context). This paper introduces PhenoPLIER, an
              innovative approach that integrates diverse data sets for a
              holistic analysis. By mapping gene-trait associations and
              drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent
              representation, PhenoPLIER enables the inference of how certain
              gene groups affect complex traits, discerns shared and unique
              transcriptomic properties among traits, and predicts how
              pharmacological interventions impact gene activity. To achieve
              this, we amalgamate thousands of gene-trait associations from
              PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083] and transcriptional
              profiles of drugs from LINCS L1000
              [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049] into a low-dimensional space
              learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of
              RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003;
              @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). Our method uses a matrix factorization
              approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1;
              @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] to extract gene modules with
              specific sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align
              with prior knowledge (pathways). We discovered that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, such as T cells for hypothyroidism and different brain
              cell types for neuropsychiatric disorders. Additionally, our
              approach enables the identification of modules associated with
              cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. We also found
              that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan
              replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE)
              network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225]. Furthermore, our module-based
              method outperforms single-gene approaches in predicting
              FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific
              pathophysiological mechanisms (Content). In conclusion, PhenoPLIER
              represents a paradigm shift in genetic studies as it prioritizes
              groups of genes over individual genes, enhancing the robustness of
              detecting and interpreting genetic associations. This approach
              offers potential in unearthing mechanistic insights from
              statistical associations, thereby improving our understanding of
              complex diseases and their therapeutic strategies (Conclusion).

              reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene
              approach, our module-based method also better predicts
              FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific
              pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action
              of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known
              immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests
              that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease
              relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the
              phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
              with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
              with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders.
              In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with
              different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes
              that act together to carry out different functions in specific
              cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and
              interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can
              prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate
              targets even when known single gene associations are not detected.
              The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation
              of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract mechanistic
              insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding
              of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.

              In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel omnigenic
              methodology that employs a gene module perspective in genetic
              research (Context). This innovative approach allows for the
              integration of varying data types into a unified representation
              for comprehensive analysis. By mapping gene-trait associations and
              drug-induced transcriptional responses into a shared latent
              representation, PhenoPLIER can discern how groups of functionally
              related genes impact complex traits, identify shared and distinct
              transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict the effects of
              pharmacological interventions on gene activity. This is achieved
              by integrating thousands of gene-trait associations from
              PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083] and transcriptional
              profiles of drugs from LINCS L1000
              [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049] into a low-dimensional space
              derived from public gene expression data from a large number of
              RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003;
              @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). This latent representation is defined by
              a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1;
              @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with
              specific sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align
              with prior knowledge (pathways). Notably, we found that diseases
              are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
              relevant cell types, such as T cells in hypothyroidism and
              different brain cell types in neuropsychiatric disorders.
              Moreover, PhenoPLIER's ability to use models derived from large
              and diverse RNA-seq datasets allows us to identify modules
              associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease
              states. Our findings in PhenomeXcan were replicated in the
              Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III
              [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225], and
              we further validated our results via a CRISPR screen analyzing
              lipid regulation in HepG2 cells (Content). In conclusion,
              PhenoPLIER represents a significant shift in the interpretation of
              genetic studies, moving away from individual genes to groups of
              genes that work collectively within specific cell types. Our
              approach not only enhances the robustness of detecting and
              interpreting genetic associations but also allows for the
              prioritization of alternative and potentially more promising
              candidate targets when known single gene associations are not
              detected. This potential to extract mechanistic insights from
              statistical associations can greatly improve our understanding of
              complex diseases and their treatment modalities (Conclusion).

              Input paragraph: Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach
              that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The
              flexibility of our method allows integrating different data
              modalities into the same representation for a joint analysis. We
              show that this module perspective can infer how groups of
              functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared
              and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict
              how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert
              their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and
              drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent
              representation. For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait
              associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan
              [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of
              drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a
              low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on
              tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
              [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use
              a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach
              [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003]
              that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
              preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways).
              When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression
              space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as
              hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with
              keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood
              cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and
              neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types.
              Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and
              heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
              associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease
              states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in
              PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic
              Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III
              [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our
              replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust
              trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even
              when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not
              reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene
              approach, our module-based method also better predicts

              In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic method that
              offers a gene module perspective for genetic studies. Our method's
              adaptability facilitates the integration of various data types for
              a unified analysis. Through this module perspective, we can deduce
              how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits,
              identify shared and unique transcriptomic characteristics among
              traits, and predict the impact of pharmacological interventions on
              gene activity. PhenoPLIER aligns gene-trait associations and
              drug-induced transcriptional responses within a common latent
              representation. We achieve this by integrating thousands of
              gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan) and
              transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000) into a
              low-dimensional space derived from public gene expression data on
              numerous RNA-seq samples (recount2). We utilize a latent
              representation defined by a matrix factorization approach that
              extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
              preferences for those that coincide with prior knowledge
              (pathways). When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced
              expression space, we find that diseases are significantly
              associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
              Additionally, PhenoPLIER's ability to use models derived from
              extensive and diverse RNA-seq datasets allows us to identify
              modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or
              disease states. We note that significant module-trait associations
              in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) are replicated in the
              Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III
              (our replication cohort). We also conduct a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells, observing more robust
              trait associations with modules than with individual genes. Our
              module-based method outperforms a single-gene approach in
              predicting FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing
              tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the
              drugs' mechanism of action. This enhanced drug-disease prediction
              implies that modules may offer a superior method to examine
              drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Exploring the
              phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
              with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
              with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders.
              In conclusion, PhenoPLIER considers groups of genes that function
              together in specific cell types, rather than single genes
              associated with different complex traits. This approach enhances
              the robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations,
              and we demonstrate its potential to prioritize alternative and
              potentially more promising candidate targets even when known
              single gene associations are not detected. This represents a
              conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies, with
              the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical
              associations, thereby enhancing our understanding of complex
              diseases and their therapeutic modalities.

              drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a
              low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on
              tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2
              [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use
              a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach
              [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003]
              that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and
              preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways).
              When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression
              space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with
              gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as
              hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with
              keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood
              cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and
              neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types.
              Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and
              heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
              associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease
              states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in
              PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic
              Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III
              [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our
              replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to
              analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust
              trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even
              when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not
              reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene
              approach, our module-based method also better predicts
              FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific
              pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action
              of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known
              immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests
              that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease
              relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the
              phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
              with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
              with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders.
              In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with
              different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes
              that act together to carry out different functions in specific
              cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and
              interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can
              prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate
              targets even when known single gene associations are not detected.
              The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation
              of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract mechanistic
              insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding
              of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.

              In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that
              offers a gene module perspective to genetic studies, thereby
              enhancing our understanding of complex traits and disease etiology
              (Context). This approach leverages the flexibility of integrating
              different data types for a comprehensive analysis, and it maps
              gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses
              into a common latent representation. To achieve this, we
              incorporate thousands of gene-trait associations and drug
              transcriptional profiles into a low-dimensional space derived from
              public gene expression data on numerous RNA-seq samples
              [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083; @doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049;
              @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]. Utilizing
              a matrix factorization approach, we extract gene modules with
              certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those aligning
              with prior knowledge (pathways) [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1;
              @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003]. We find that diseases are
              significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant
              cell types, and we can identify modules associated with cell types
              under specific stimuli or disease states. Our findings are
              replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE)
              network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (Content). Furthermore, our
              module-based approach outperforms a single-gene approach in
              predicting FDA-approved drug-disease links, suggesting that
              modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease
              relationships. This approach also reveals stable trait clusters
              associated with relevant tissues, offering insights into the
              clustering of complex traits. In essence, PhenoPLIER emphasizes
              the collective action of gene groups in specific cell types over
              individual genes in interpreting genetic associations, providing a
              potential avenue for identifying promising therapeutic targets and
              understanding drug mechanisms (Conclusion). This represents a
              paradigm shift in the interpretation of genetic studies, with the
              potential to derive mechanistic insights from statistical
              associations, thereby advancing our understanding of complex
              diseases and their therapeutic modalities.

              approach, our module-based method also better predicts
              FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific
              pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action
              of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known
              immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests
              that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease
              relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the
              phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated
              with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids
              with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders.
              In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with
              different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes
              that act together to carry out different functions in specific
              cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and
              interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can
              prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate
              targets even when known single gene associations are not detected.
              The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation
              of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract mechanistic
              insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding
              of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.

            Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach that provides a
            gene module perspective to genetic studies. The flexibility of our
            method allows integrating different data modalities into the same
            representation for a joint analysis. We show that this module
            perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes
            influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic
            properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological
            perturbations affect genes' activity to exert their effects.
            PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced
            transcriptional responses into a common latent representation. For
            this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations (using TWAS
            from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional
            profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000
            [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space
            learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of
            RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003;
            @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a latent representation defined by a
            matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1;
            @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with
            certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align
            with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait
            associations to this reduced expression space, we observe that
            diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in
            relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal
            endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological
            assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose
            tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell
            types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large
            and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules
            associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states.
            We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan
            (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records
            and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72;
            @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort).
            Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation
            in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with
            modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to
            be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide
            significance. Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based
            method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by
            capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with
            the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular
            traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease
            prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to
            examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally,
            exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters
            associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch
            involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and
            neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, instead of considering
            single genes associated with different complex traits, PhenoPLIER
            incorporates groups of genes that act together to carry out
            different functions in specific cell types. This approach improves
            robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and
            here we show how it can prioritize alternative and potentially more
            promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations
            are not detected. The approach represents a conceptual shift in the
            interpretation of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract
            mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance the
            understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.
