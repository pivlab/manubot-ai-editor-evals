          Genes work together in context-specific networks to karry out
          different functions [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259].

          Variations in these genes can change their functional role and, at a
          higher level, affect disease-relevant biological processes
          [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6].

          In this context, determining how genes influence complex traits
          requires mechanistically understanding ekspression regulation across
          different cell types [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;

          in turn should lead to improved treatments [@doi:10.1038/ng.3314;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008489].

          Genetic studies have been instrumental in identifying the genetic
          basis of complex traits and diseases. However, the functional
          interpretation of these associations remains a significant challenge.
          This manuscript presents a novel approach to project genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns, thereby highlighting
          disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By integrating genetic studies
          with functional genomics, we aim to elucidate the role of gene
          co-expression in the clustering of complex traits. This approach not
          only provides insights into the therapeutic targets but also paves the
          way for drug repurposing.

          Genetic studies have significantly advanced our understanding of
          complex traits and diseases, yet the functional interpretation of
          genetic associations remains a challenge (1,2). The integration of
          functional genomics data, such as gene co-expression patterns, can
          provide valuable insights into the biological mechanisms underlying
          these associations (3,4). However, current methods for projecting
          genetic associations onto gene expression patterns often overlook the
          clustering of complex traits, which can lead to incomplete or
          misleading interpretations (5,6). This gap in our understanding
          hinders the identification of therapeutic targets and the repurposing
          of existing drugs. Our manuscript addresses this issue by developing a
          novel approach that incorporates the clustering of complex traits into
          the projection of genetic associations. We demonstrate the utility of
          our approach by highlighting the etiology of various diseases and the
          mechanisms of several drugs, thereby providing a new perspective on
          the functional interpretation of genetic studies.

            requires mechanistically understanding ekspression regulation across
            different cell types [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
            @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3; @doi:10.1038/s41576-019-0200-9],
            which in turn should lead to improved treatments
            [@doi:10.1038/ng.3314; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008489].

            Previous studies have described different regulatory DNA elements
            [@doi:10.1038/nature11247; @doi:10.1038/nature14248;
            @doi:10.1038/nature12787; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-03145-z;
            @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3] including genetic effects on gene
            expression across different tissues [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776].

            Integrating functional genomics data and GWAS data

            @doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0081-4; @doi:10.1038/ncomms6890] has
            improoved the identification of these transcriptional mechanisms
            that, when dysregulated, commonly result in tissue- and cell
            lineage-specific pathology [@pmid:20624743; @pmid:14707169;
