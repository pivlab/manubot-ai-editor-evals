Genetic studies have been instrumental in identifying the genetic basis of complex traits and diseases. However, the functional interpretation of these associations remains a significant challenge. This manuscript presents a novel approach to project genetic associations through gene expression patterns, thereby highlighting disease etiology and drug mechanisms. By integrating genetic studies with functional genomics, we aim to elucidate the role of gene co-expression in the clustering of complex traits. This approach not only provides insights into the therapeutic targets but also paves the way for drug repurposing.

Genetic studies have significantly advanced our understanding of complex traits and diseases, yet the functional interpretation of genetic associations remains a challenge (1,2). The integration of functional genomics data, such as gene co-expression patterns, can provide valuable insights into the biological mechanisms underlying these associations (3,4). However, current methods for projecting genetic associations onto gene expression patterns often overlook the clustering of complex traits, which can lead to incomplete or misleading interpretations (5,6). This gap in our understanding hinders the identification of therapeutic targets and the repurposing of existing drugs. Our manuscript addresses this issue by developing a novel approach that incorporates the clustering of complex traits into the projection of genetic associations. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by highlighting the etiology of various diseases and the mechanisms of several drugs, thereby providing a new perspective on the functional interpretation of genetic studies.
