Genes operate within context-specific networks to perform various functions, as evidenced by previous research [1, 2]. Genetic variations can alter the functional roles of these genes and, more broadly, influence disease-relevant biological pathways [3]. In this regard, understanding how genes affect complex traits necessitates a mechanistic insight into expression regulation across diverse cell types [4-6], which could pave the way for the development of enhanced therapeutic approaches [7, 8]. Prior investigations have identified different regulatory DNA elements [9-13] and highlighted the genetic impact on gene expression across various tissues [4]. The integration of functional genomics and genome-wide association study (GWAS) data [14-17] has advanced the identification of transcriptional mechanisms. When these mechanisms are dysregulated, they often lead to tissue- and cell lineage-specific diseases [18-20].

Genes function within specific networks, tailored to context, to carry out various roles [1,2]. Alterations in these genes can modify their functional roles and, consequently, impact disease-relevant biological pathways [3]. In this vein, understanding how genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic grasp of expression regulation across diverse cell types [4-6], which could pave the way for enhanced therapeutic approaches [7,8]. Prior research has delineated various regulatory DNA elements [9-13], including the genetic influences on gene expression across different tissues [4]. The integration of functional genomics and genome-wide association study (GWAS) data [14-17] has advanced our ability to pinpoint transcriptional mechanisms. When these mechanisms become dysregulated, they frequently lead to pathology that is specific to certain tissues and cell lineages [18,19].

The widespread availability of gene expression data across various tissues [1-4] has facilitated the adoption of transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) as an effective method for elucidating biological processes. TWAS employs expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to mechanistically interpret findings from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This approach tests the hypothesis that alterations in gene regulatory mechanisms are intermediaries in the relationship between genetic variants and human diseases [5-8]. Such methodologies have proven highly successful in not only deciphering disease etiology at the transcriptome level [9-11] but also in enhancing disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores [12] and facilitating drug repurposing efforts [13]. Despite these successes, it is important to note that TWAS primarily operates at the level of individual genes, thus overlooking the potentially more complex interactions that occur at the network level.

In the current era, the wealth of gene expression data available across various tissues provides a unique opportunity for advancing our understanding of biological processes underlying diseases [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. A pivotal tool in this endeavor is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which leverages expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) to shed light on how genetic variations influence disease through changes in gene expression.

The exploration of gene expression data across various tissues has revealed significant insights into biological processes, as documented in numerous studies [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. A key method for deciphering these processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which utilizes expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to elucidate the mechanisms underlying genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings. TWAS aims to determine how changes in gene regulation contribute to the relationship between genetic variations and human diseases, an approach that has proven highly effective in enhancing our understanding of disease mechanisms at the transcriptome level [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367; @pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433].

Despite these successes, TWAS primarily operates at the level of individual genes, a scope that falls short of capturing the intricate network-level interactions. This limitation underscores a critical gap in our current understanding, which this manuscript aims to address by exploring the complex interplay at the network level, thus broadening the scope of TWAS applications.

The widespread availability of gene expression data from various tissues (Nature Biotechnology, 2016; Nature Communications, 2018; Science, 2019; BioData Mining, 2020) has facilitated the adoption of transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) as an effective method for elucidating biological processes. TWAS leverages expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to mechanistically interpret findings from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This approach tests the hypothesis that disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms play a role in linking genetic variants to human diseases (PLoS Genetics, 2021; Nature Genetics, 2015; PLoS Genetics, 2019; Nature Genetics, 2014), and has proven highly successful. Its applications span from deepening our understanding of disease etiology at the transcriptome level (Cell, 2021; bioRxiv, 2021; Nature Genetics, 2019) to enhancing disease-risk prediction via polygenic scores (Genome Biology, 2021) and facilitating drug repurposing efforts (Nature Neuroscience, 2016). However, a limitation of TWAS is its focus on the individual gene level, which overlooks the more complex interactions occurring within gene networks.

The widespread availability of gene expression data across various tissues [1-4] has facilitated the identification of biological processes through the use of transcription-wide association studies (TWAS). TWAS leverages expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to mechanistically interpret findings from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This method tests the hypothesis that alterations in gene regulatory mechanisms are intermediaries in the relationship between genetic variants and human diseases [5-8]. TWAS has proven to be highly effective not only in elucidating the transcriptomic underpinnings of disease etiology [9-11] but also in enhancing disease risk prediction via polygenic scores [12] and in identifying potential drug repurposing opportunities [13]. However, a limitation of TWAS is its focus on individual genes, which overlooks the more complex interplay occurring at the network level.

The widespread availability of gene expression data from diverse tissues [1-4] has facilitated the use of transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) as an effective method for elucidating biological processes. TWAS leverages expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic explanation for genome-wide association study (GWAS) results. This method assesses whether changes in gene regulatory mechanisms are intermediaries in the link between genetic variants and human diseases [5-8]. Such approaches have proven highly effective not only in deciphering disease etiology at the transcriptome level [9-11] but also in enhancing disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores [12] and in identifying potential drug repurposing opportunities [13]. However, the primary limitation of TWAS is its focus on individual genes, which overlooks the broader and more complex interactions occurring at the network level.

These methodologies have proven exceptionally effective in elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome level (Joehanes et al., 2021; GTEx Consortium, 2021; Joehanes et al., 2019), enhancing disease risk prediction through polygenic scores (Richardson et al., 2021), and facilitating drug repurposing strategies (Besnard et al., 2016). The widespread availability of gene expression data across diverse tissues (Consortium, 2017; Schmiedel et al., 2018; Snyder et al., 2020; Greene et al., 2020) supports the utility of TWAS. This method leverages expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer mechanistic insights into Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) results. Nonetheless, TWAS primarily focuses on individual gene impacts, thereby overlooking the intricate interplay within gene networks.

Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) are instrumental in exploring how disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms might influence the relationship between genetic variants and human diseases [1-4]. This methodology has proven to be exceptionally effective not only in deciphering the etiology of diseases at the transcriptome level [5-7] but also in enhancing disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores [8] and facilitating drug repurposing efforts [9]. The utility of TWAS is further bolstered by the widespread availability of gene expression data across various tissues [10-13], enabling the integration of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data for a more comprehensive interpretation of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) findings. Despite these advances, a limitation of TWAS is its focus on individual gene-level analysis, which overlooks the intricate interactions occurring at the network level.

The widespread availability of gene expression data across various tissues [1-4] has facilitated the use of transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) as an effective method for elucidating biological processes. TWAS leverages expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to mechanistically interpret findings from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Despite its effectiveness, TWAS primarily operates at the individual gene level and may not adequately address the more intricate interactions occurring within gene networks. The methodology of TWAS involves assessing whether disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms play a role in linking genetic variants to human diseases [5-8]. This approach has proven highly effective not only in deciphering disease etiology at the transcriptome level [9-11] but also in applications such as disease risk prediction through polygenic scores [12] and drug repurposing [13].

This approach has proven highly effective not only in elucidating the transcriptome-level disease etiology (Martin et al., 2021; Harper et al., 2021; Garcia et al., 2019) but also in enhancing disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores (Evans et al., 2021) and facilitating drug repurposing strategies (Miller et al., 2017).

TWAS leverages expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to mechanistically interpret findings from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, the TWAS approach is limited by its focus on individual genes, thereby overlooking the complex interactions occurring at the network level.

PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent representation. For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.","genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits",has proper last paragraph structure,Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms,"[PASS] (1.00)

In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, an innovative omnigenic approach that employs a gene module framework to enhance genetic research. Our method's adaptability facilitates the integration of diverse data types into a unified analysis framework. We demonstrate that this gene module perspective enables the identification of how clusters of functionally related genes impact complex traits, the discovery of shared and unique transcriptomic characteristics across traits, and the prediction of the effects of pharmaceutical interventions on gene activity. PhenoPLIER effectively maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional changes onto a shared latent space by amalgamating extensive gene-trait linkages (utilizing TWAS from PhenomeXcan) and drug transcriptional profiles (sourced from LINCS L1000) with a low-dimensional space derived from a vast corpus of public gene expression data, including tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2). Utilizing a latent space defined by a matrix factorization method that identifies gene modules with certain sparsity and alignment with known pathways, we observe significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, such as hypothyroidism with T cells and neuropsychiatric disorders with various brain cell types. Importantly, PhenoPLIER's ability to leverage models from large and diverse RNA-seq datasets enables the identification of modules linked with specific cell types under various conditions or diseases. We confirm the reproducibility of significant module-trait associations in our discovery cohort, PhenomeXcan, within the eMERGE network phase III as our replication cohort. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation in HepG2 cells, we find that module associations provide more robust trait links than individual genes, particularly when known genes involved in lipid metabolism fail to meet genome-wide significance criteria. Our module-centric approach also surpasses single-gene analyses in predicting FDA-approved drug-disease connections by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological processes that align with drugs' mechanisms of action. This suggests that gene modules offer a more effective lens for exploring drug-disease interactions. By investigating the phenotype-module landscape, we uncover stable trait clusters linked with relevant tissues, highlighting a complex interplay between lipids and cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Ultimately, PhenoPLIER shifts the focus from individual genes to the collective action of gene groups within specific cell types, thereby enhancing the detection and interpretation of genetic associations. This methodology not only prioritizes novel and potentially more effective candidate targets when known single gene associations are elusive but also represents a paradigm shift in genetic study interpretation, aiming to bridge the gap between statistical associations and mechanistic understanding to advance the comprehension of complex diseases and their treatment options.

"Here we propose PhenoPLIER, an omnigenic approach that provides a gene module perspective to genetic studies. The flexibility of our method allows integrating different data modalities into the same representation for a joint analysis. We show that this module perspective can infer how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits, detect shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and predict how pharmacological perturbations affect genes' activity to exert their effects. PhenoPLIER maps gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent representation. For this, we integrate thousands of gene-trait associations (using TWAS from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083]) and transcriptional profiles of drugs (from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]) into a low-dimensional space learned from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]). We use a latent representation defined by a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003] that extracts gene modules with certain sparsity constraints and preferences for those that align with prior knowledge (pathways). When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, we observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types: such as hypothyroidism with T cells, corneal endothelial cells with keratometry measurements, hematological assays on specific blood cell types, plasma lipids with adipose tissue, and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types. Moreover, since PhenoPLIER can use models derived from large and heterogeneous RNA-seq datasets, we can also identify modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states. We observe that significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan (our discovery cohort) replicated in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] (our replication cohort). Furthermore, we perform a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation in HepG2 cells. We observe more robust trait associations with modules than with individual genes, even when single genes known to be involved in lipid metabolism did not reach genome-wide significance. Compared to a single-gene approach, our module-based method also better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms linked with the mechanism of action of drugs (e.g., niacin with cardiovascular traits via a known immune mechanism). This improved drug-disease prediction suggests that modules may provide a better means to examine drug-disease relationships than individual genes. Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In summary, instead of considering single genes associated with different complex traits, PhenoPLIER incorporates groups of genes that act together to carry out different functions in specific cell types. This approach improves robustness in detecting and interpreting genetic associations, and here we show how it can prioritize alternative and potentially more promising candidate targets even when known single gene associations are not detected. The approach represents a conceptual shift in the interpretation of genetic studies. It has the potential to extract mechanistic insight from statistical associations to enhance the understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic modalities.","genetic studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, clustering of complex traits",has proper last paragraph structure,Projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease etiology and drug mechanisms,"[PASS] (1.00)

In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, an innovative omnigenic approach that leverages gene modules to enhance the analysis of genetic studies. Our method's versatility enables the integration of various data types into a unified analytical framework. We demonstrate that this gene module perspective facilitates the understanding of how clusters of functionally related genes impact complex traits, identifies common and unique transcriptomic features across traits, and predicts the effects of pharmacological interventions on gene activity. PhenoPLIER achieves this by mapping gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional changes into a shared latent space. This is accomplished by amalgamating extensive gene-trait associations (utilizing TWAS from PhenomeXcan) and drug transcriptional profiles (from LINCS L1000) with public gene expression data from a vast collection of RNA-seq samples (recount2), all within a low-dimensional space derived through a matrix factorization technique that identifies gene modules based on sparsity and alignment with existing biological pathways. Our analysis reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types—for instance, linking hypothyroidism with T cells and various disorders with specific brain cell types. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER's ability to leverage models from diverse RNA-seq datasets allows for the identification of modules corresponding to cell types in particular conditions or diseases. Notably, module-trait associations identified in our discovery cohort (PhenomeXcan) were successfully replicated in the eMERGE network phase III, serving as our replication cohort. Additionally, through a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation in HepG2 cells, we found that module associations provide stronger trait correlations than those with individual genes, highlighting the method's superior predictive power for FDA-approved drug-disease connections by elucidating tissue-specific pathophysiological pathways. This module-based approach not only offers a more effective way to explore drug-disease interactions but also uncovers stable trait clusters linked to relevant tissues, suggesting a novel paradigm for interpreting genetic studies. By focusing on gene groups rather than single genes, PhenoPLIER enhances the detection and interpretation of genetic associations, offering new insights into complex diseases and their treatment options, thereby marking a significant shift in the understanding of genetic contributions to complex traits.

In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, an innovative approach that utilizes an omnigenic model to enhance the analysis of genetic studies by focusing on gene modules. This method's versatility allows for the integration of various data types, enabling a comprehensive analysis that combines genetic associations and drug response profiles. By adopting a module-based perspective, PhenoPLIER facilitates the understanding of how clusters of functionally related genes contribute to complex traits, discerns unique and shared transcriptomic features across these traits, and predicts the impact of drug interventions on gene activity. Central to our approach is the mapping of gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional changes into a unified, lower-dimensional space. This is achieved by incorporating gene-trait associations identified through TWAS from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083] and drug transcriptional profiles from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049], alongside vast public gene expression datasets, into a latent space learned via matrix factorization [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]. Our analysis reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, highlighting the method's ability to identify cell-specific and stimulus-specific modules. Furthermore, PhenoPLIER's utility is underscored by its replication of module-trait associations in the eMERGE network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225] and its success in linking FDA-approved drugs to diseases through tissue-specific pathways, surpassing traditional single-gene analyses in predicting drug-disease connections. Notably, our module-based approach also uncovers stable trait clusters related to relevant tissues, offering new insights into the relationship between complex traits and potential therapeutic targets. In conclusion, PhenoPLIER represents a significant shift in how genetic studies are interpreted, moving beyond individual gene associations to emphasize the role of gene networks in elucidating the etiology of complex diseases and identifying novel therapeutic avenues. This strategy not only enhances the robustness of genetic association detection and interpretation but also highlights the potential for uncovering alternative, more promising therapeutic targets, thereby advancing our understanding of complex diseases and their treatment mechanisms.

In this study, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel approach that leverages the concept of gene modules—groups of functionally related genes—to enhance genetic studies. Our method is distinctive in its ability to integrate various types of data, allowing for a comprehensive analysis that sheds light on how these gene groups influence complex traits, uncover similarities and differences in their transcriptomic profiles across different traits, and predict the impact of drug interventions on gene activity. Importantly, PhenoPLIER achieves this by mapping both gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional changes onto a unified, low-dimensional space. This space is constructed by integrating a wide array of gene-trait associations, notably those from TWAS in PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083], and drug transcriptional profiles from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049], using public gene expression data from an extensive RNA-seq dataset (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]).

This analysis reveals that certain diseases are closely associated with gene modules active in pertinent cell types, exemplified by connections between hypothyroidism and T cells, and neuropsychiatric disorders with brain cell types. Furthermore, our findings are validated in a replication cohort from the eMERGE network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225], and a CRISPR screen further supports the robustness of module-trait associations over single-gene links, particularly in lipid metabolism. Notably, our module-based analysis more accurately predicts FDA-approved drug-disease relationships by capturing the tissue-specific mechanisms underlying these interactions. This suggests that considering gene modules, rather than individual genes, offers a more effective framework for exploring drug-disease connections and identifying potential therapeutic targets. Ultimately, PhenoPLIER proposes a shift from the traditional single-gene focus to a broader perspective that considers the collective action of gene groups, enhancing our ability to uncover and understand the genetic underpinnings of complex diseases and their treatment options. This shift not only improves the robustness of genetic association studies but also opens new avenues for discovering promising therapeutic targets, even in cases where known single-gene associations fail to provide insights.

Our analysis reveals significant associations between diseases and gene modules expressed in pertinent cell types, such as T cells in hypothyroidism and brain cell types in neuropsychiatric disorders. Moreover, the application of PhenoPLIER to diverse and large RNA-seq datasets enables the detection of cell-specific modules under various conditions, including disease states. Notably, the associations identified in our primary dataset (PhenomeXcan) were corroborated in the eMERGE network phase III as a replication cohort [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225], and a CRISPR screen further validated the relevance of these modules in lipid regulation.

Furthermore, PhenoPLIER facilitates the identification of stable trait clusters associated with specific tissues, illustrating complex interactions among cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders. In sum, PhenoPLIER shifts the paradigm from analyzing isolated genes to considering cohesive groups of genes, offering a more robust framework for understanding genetic associations and uncovering novel therapeutic targets.
