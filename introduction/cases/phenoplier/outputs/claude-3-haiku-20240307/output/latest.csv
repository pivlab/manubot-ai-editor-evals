Revised paragraph:

Genes work together in context-specific networks to carry out different functions [1-3]. Variations in these genes can change their functional role and, at a higher level, affect disease-relevant biological processes [4]. In this context, determining how genes influence complex traits requires mechanistically understanding expression regulation across different cell types [5-7], which in turn should lead to improved treatments [8,9]. Previous studies have described different regulatory DNA elements [10-14], including genetic effects on gene expression across different tissues [5]. Integrating functional genomics data and genome-wide association study (GWAS) data [15-18] has improved the identification of these transcriptional mechanisms that, when dysregulated, commonly result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathology [19-21].

# Revised Paragraph

**Context:** Genetic studies have made significant progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying complex human diseases. One approach, known as transcription-wide association study (TWAS), has been particularly successful in elucidating the role of gene regulatory mechanisms in mediating the association between genetic variants and disease.

**Content:** TWAS integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for findings from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. These methods have been instrumental in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] and have also enabled advancements in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. Furthermore, the availability of gene expression data across various tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9] has facilitated the use of TWAS to identify these biological processes.

**Conclusion:** However, TWAS operates at the individual gene level, which may not capture the more complex interactions and networks that underlie disease etiology and drug mechanisms. Therefore, a comprehensive approach that considers gene co-expression patterns and their associations with complex traits could provide additional insights into the genetic underpinnings of disease and inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

**Context:**
Genetic studies have made significant progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases. One approach, known as transcription-wide association study (TWAS), has been particularly successful in linking genetic variants to disease risk by examining their effects on gene expression.

**Content:**
TWAS leverages expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for findings from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367].

**Conclusion:**
However, TWAS operates at the individual gene level and may not capture the more complex interactions within gene regulatory networks. Exploring gene expression patterns and co-expression networks could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the biological processes underlying complex traits and diseases, potentially leading to the identification of novel therapeutic targets and drug mechanisms.

However, TWAS operates at the individual gene level, which may not capture more complex interactions at the network level. TWAS relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. These TWAS-based approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].

Key revisions:
1. Clarified the introduction of TWAS as an ""effective approach to identify biological processes underlying complex traits"".
2. Simplified the description of TWAS integrating eQTLs data to provide a ""mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings"".
3. Removed the redundant phrase ""these biological processes"" and streamlined the transition to the limitations of TWAS.
4. Improved the flow and structure of the paragraph.

# Revised Paragraph

**Context:** Advancements in genomic technologies have enabled the collection of gene expression data across various tissues, providing valuable insights into the underlying biological processes involved in human health and disease.

**Content:** One effective approach to leverage this wealth of data is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) to offer a mechanistic interpretation of genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. TWAS works by testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these approaches have been successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433], as well as in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].

**Conclusion:** However, TWAS operates at the individual gene level, which may not capture the more complex interactions that occur at the network level. Addressing this limitation could provide additional insights into the genetic underpinnings of complex traits and inform the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.

# Revised Paragraph

*Context:* The availability of gene expression data across multiple tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9] has enabled the use of effective approaches, such as transcription-wide association studies (TWAS), to identify biological processes underlying complex traits and diseases.

*Content:* TWAS integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation of genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings. This approach tests whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367].

*Conclusion:* However, TWAS works at the individual gene level and may not capture more complex interactions at the network level, suggesting the need for further research to address this limitation.
