          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript titled 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' with keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should
          adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion
          (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one
          or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the
          format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]", and 4) the revised
          paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C
          structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the
          format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]", and 4) the revised
          paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C
          structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' with keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should
          adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion
          (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one
          or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the

          understand how genetic variations influence gene expression patterns
          and, ultimately, contribute to the development of complex diseases and
          traits.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section.


          Input paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across
          several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;

          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify
          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS
          relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms
          mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these
          approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in
          disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)

          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks. However, TWAS works at the individual
          gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the
          network level.

          etiology and drug mechanisms' with keywords 'genetic studies,

          following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should
          adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion
          (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one
          or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the

          Changes made:

          1. Restructured the first sentence for better clarity and flow.

          2. Spelled out the abbreviation "GWAS" at first mention.

          3. Split the long second sentence into two sentences for better
          readability.

          4. Added "using" before "polygenic scores" for clarity.

          5. Changed "works" to "operates" for more precise language.

          Changes made:

          1. Restructured the first sentence for clarity and conciseness.

          2. Spelled out the acronym "GWAS" at first mention.

          3. Split the second sentence into two for better readability.

          4. Clarified the use of polygenic scores in disease-risk prediction.

          5. Replaced "works" with "operates" for more precise language.

          Changes made:

          1. Rearranged the sentences to improve the logical flow of the

          2. Spelled out the abbreviation "TWAS" at the beginning of the
          paragraph.

          3. Moved the explanation of TWAS integrating eQTLs data before
          mentioning its applications.

          4. Spelled out the abbreviation "GWAS" and linked it to the
          explanation of TWAS's role in interpreting GWAS findings.

          5. Minor grammatical and stylistic changes for clarity and
          conciseness.

          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these

          have also shown promise in disease-risk prediction using polygenic

          level and does not capture more complex interactions at the network
          level.


          Key changes:

          1. Rearranged sentences for better flow and clarity

          2. Explained TWAS and eQTLs before mentioning their applications 

          3. Specified that TWAS provides mechanistic insights at the
          transcriptome level

          4. Clarified that polygenic scores are used for disease-risk
          prediction

          5. Emphasized the limitation of TWAS in capturing network-level
          interactions


          The revised paragraph maintains the key points while improving
          readability and coherence. The citations are retained in their
          original format.

          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific

          Changes made:

          1. Reordered the sentences to improve the logical flow of the
          paragraph.

          2. Spelled out the abbreviations "TWAS" and "GWAS" at their first
          mention.

          3. Removed the phrase "Given the availability of gene expression data
          across several tissues" as it is implied by the following sentence.

          4. Removed the phrase "an effective approach to identify these
          biological processes is" to make the sentence more concise.

          5. Moved the citations to the end of their respective sentences for
          better readability.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these

          Changes made:

          1. Reordered the sentences to improve the logical flow of information.

          2. Expanded the TWAS acronym at the first mention and moved it to the
          beginning of the paragraph.

          3. Expanded the eQTLs and GWAS acronyms at their first mention.

          4. Removed the phrase "Given the availability of gene expression data
          across several tissues" as it is implied by the following citation
          list.

          5. Minor grammatical and stylistic changes to improve clarity and
          readability.

          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these

          However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not
          capture more complex interactions at the network level.

          Changes made:

          1. Rearranged the sentences to improve the logical flow of the
          paragraph.

          2. Spelled out the acronym "TWAS" at the beginning of the paragraph.

          3. Moved the explanation of TWAS integrating eQTLs data from various
          tissues to the second sentence for better context.

          4. Spelled out the acronym "GWAS" and linked it to the explanation of
          how TWAS provides mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.

          5. Simplified the language in the last sentence to make it more
          concise.

          traits and diseases by integrating gene expression data across
          multiple tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;

          loci (eQTLs) data. TWAS tests whether perturbations in gene regulatory
          mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human
          diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. These
          approaches have been highly successful in understanding disease
          etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433], as well as in
          disease-risk prediction using polygenic scores
          [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing

          level and does not capture more complex interactions at the network
          level.


          Changes made:

          1. Rearranged the sentences to improve the logical flow of the
          paragraph.

          2. Added a brief explanation of TWAS at the beginning of the
          paragraph.

          3. Removed redundant information about TWAS relying on testing gene
          regulatory mechanisms.

          4. Clarified that polygenic scores are used for disease-risk
          prediction.

          5. Moved the limitation of TWAS to the end of the paragraph to
          emphasize the gap in current approaches.

          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two

          Here is the revised paragraph:


          Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) are an effective
          approach to identify biological processes associated with human
          diseases by integrating gene expression data across several tissues
          [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;
          @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9] with
          expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data. TWAS tests whether
          perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association
          between genetic variants and human diseases
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. These
          approaches have been highly successful in understanding disease
          etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433], disease-risk
          prediction using polygenic scores [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w],
          and drug repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. However, TWAS works at
          the individual gene level and does not capture more complex
          interactions at the network level.


          The main changes are:


          1. Rearranged the sentences to improve the logical flow of the
          paragraph.

          2. Removed redundant information about TWAS relying on testing gene
          regulatory mechanisms, as this was already mentioned in the previous
          sentence.

          3. Grouped the applications of TWAS (understanding disease etiology,
          disease-risk prediction, and drug repurposing) into a single sentence
          for better readability.

          4. Moved the limitation of TWAS to the end of the paragraph to
          emphasize the need for more complex network-level approaches.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these

          Here is the revised paragraph:


          Given the availability of gene expression data across several tissues
          [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;

          transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) provide an effective
          approach to identify biological processes by integrating expression
          quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data and offering mechanistic
          interpretations for genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings.
          TWAS relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory
          mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants and human
          diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;

          level and does not capture more complex interactions at the network
          level.


          Changes made:

          1. Removed the first "However" to improve flow and clarity.

          2. Moved the explanation of TWAS before mentioning its limitations for
          better context.

          3. Expanded the GWAS acronym.

          4. Separated the applications of TWAS (disease etiology, risk
          prediction, and drug repurposing) into a new sentence for clarity.

          5. Moved the limitation of TWAS to the end of the paragraph for a more
          logical flow.

          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these

          Input paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across
          several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;

          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify
          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.
          However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not
          capture more complex interactions at the network level. TWAS relies on
          testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate
          the association between genetic variants and human diseases

          approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;

              Context: Integrating gene expression data across tissues with

              Content: The transcription-wide association study (TWAS) leverages

              1. Restructured the first sentence for better clarity and flow.

              2. Spelled out the abbreviation "GWAS" at first mention.

              3. Split the long second sentence into two sentences for better
              readability.

              4. Added "using" before "polygenic scores" for clarity.

              5. Changed "works" to "operates" for more precise language.

              Context: Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) have
              emerged as a powerful approach to elucidate the biological
              processes underlying genetic associations by integrating gene
              expression data across multiple tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;

              Changes made:

              1. Rearranged the sentences to improve the logical flow of the

              2. Spelled out the abbreviation "TWAS" at the beginning of the
              paragraph.

              3. Moved the explanation of TWAS integrating eQTLs data before
              mentioning its applications.

              4. Spelled out the abbreviation "GWAS" and linked it to the
              explanation of TWAS's role in interpreting GWAS findings.

              5. Minor grammatical and stylistic changes for clarity and
              conciseness.

              Here is the revised paragraph:


              Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been highly
              successful in understanding disease etiology by testing whether
              perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the
              association between genetic variants and human diseases
              [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
              @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. TWAS
              approaches integrate expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
              data across several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
              @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
              @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9] to provide a mechanistic
              interpretation for genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings
              at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]. These
              approaches have also shown promise in disease-risk prediction
              using polygenic scores [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug
              repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. However, TWAS operates at the
              individual gene level and does not capture more complex
              interactions at the network level.


              Key changes:

              1. Rearranged sentences for better flow and clarity

              2. Explained TWAS and eQTLs before mentioning their applications 

              3. Specified that TWAS provides mechanistic insights at the
              transcriptome level

              4. Clarified that polygenic scores are used for disease-risk
              prediction

              5. Emphasized the limitation of TWAS in capturing network-level
              interactions


              The revised paragraph maintains the key points while improving
              readability and coherence. The citations are retained in their
              original format.

              successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome

              Changes made:

              1. Reordered the sentences to improve the logical flow of the
              paragraph.

              2. Spelled out the abbreviations "TWAS" and "GWAS" at their first
              mention.

              3. Removed the phrase "Given the availability of gene expression
              data across several tissues" as it is implied by the following
              sentence.

              4. Removed the phrase "an effective approach to identify these
              biological processes is" to make the sentence more concise.

              5. Moved the citations to the end of their respective sentences
              for better readability.

              Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) have been highly
              successful in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome
              level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;

              provide a mechanistic interpretation for genome-wide association
              study (GWAS) findings by testing whether perturbations in gene
              regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic
              variants and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;

              gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at
              the network level.


              Changes made:

              1. Reordered the sentences to improve the logical flow of
              information.

              2. Expanded the TWAS acronym at the first mention and moved it to
              the beginning of the paragraph.

              3. Expanded the eQTLs and GWAS acronyms at their first mention.

              4. Removed the phrase "Given the availability of gene expression
              data across several tissues" as it is implied by the following
              citation list.

              5. Minor grammatical and stylistic changes to improve clarity and
              readability.

              3. Moved the explanation of TWAS integrating eQTLs data from
              various tissues to the second sentence for better context.

              4. Spelled out the acronym "GWAS" and linked it to the explanation
              of how TWAS provides mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.

              Context: Gene expression data across multiple tissues has enabled
              the development of transcription-wide association studies (TWAS)
              to provide mechanistic interpretations for genome-wide association
              study (GWAS) findings [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;

              @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. 


              Content: TWAS integrates expression quantitative trait loci

              Conclusion: However, TWAS operates at the individual gene level
              and does not capture more complex interactions at the network
              level, leaving a gap in our understanding of the role of gene
              networks in disease etiology and potential therapeutic
              interventions.

              Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) are an effective
              approach to identify biological processes associated with human
              diseases by integrating gene expression data across several
              tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;

              with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data. TWAS tests
              whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the
              association between genetic variants and human diseases
              [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
              @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. These
              approaches have been highly successful in understanding disease
              etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433], disease-risk
              prediction using polygenic scores
              [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w], and drug repurposing
              [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. However, TWAS works at the individual gene
              level and does not capture more complex interactions at the
              network level.


              The main changes are:


              1. Rearranged the sentences to improve the logical flow of the
              paragraph.

              2. Removed redundant information about TWAS relying on testing
              gene regulatory mechanisms, as this was already mentioned in the
              previous sentence.

              3. Grouped the applications of TWAS (understanding disease
              etiology, disease-risk prediction, and drug repurposing) into a
              single sentence for better readability.

              4. Moved the limitation of TWAS to the end of the paragraph to
              emphasize the need for more complex network-level approaches.

              Content: The transcription-wide association study (TWAS) is one
              such approach that leverages expression quantitative trait loci
              (eQTLs) data to provide mechanistic interpretations for
              genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings by testing whether
              perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the
              association between genetic variants and human diseases

              individual gene level and does not capture more complex
              interactions at the network level, highlighting the need for novel
              approaches that can integrate genetic associations with gene

              1. Removed the first "However" to improve flow and clarity.

              2. Moved the explanation of TWAS before mentioning its limitations
              for better context.

              3. Expanded the GWAS acronym.

              4. Separated the applications of TWAS (disease etiology, risk
              prediction, and drug repurposing) into a new sentence for clarity.

              5. Moved the limitation of TWAS to the end of the paragraph for a

              at the individual gene level and does not capture more complex
              interactions at the network level, highlighting the need for novel
              approaches that can integrate gene expression and genetic data to
              uncover the intricate relationships between genes and their role
              in disease pathogenesis.

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining
              the text of a scientific manuscript titled 'Projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms' with keywords 'genetic studies,
              functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
              repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise
              the following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance
              clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The
              revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a
              Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure
              begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context),
              progresses through what is known from the literature (Content),
              and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap the
              manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1)
              preserve the original information as much as possible, with
              minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to
              scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the
              original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
              and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as
              "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;

              the entire revision, following the C-C-C structure, within a

              trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation
              for GWAS findings. However, TWAS works at the individual gene
              level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the
