          Genes interact within context-specific networks to perform various
          functions [1, 2]. Alterations in these genes can modify their
          functional roles and, at a broader level, impact disease-relevant
          biological pathways [3]. In this regard, understanding how genes
          affect complex traits necessitates a mechanistic insight into
          expression regulation across different cell types [4-6], which could
          lead to the development of enhanced therapeutic approaches [7, 8].
          Previous research has elucidated various regulatory DNA elements
          [9-13] that include genetic influences on gene expression across
          diverse tissues [4]. By integrating functional genomics data with
          genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data [14-17], researchers have
          improved the identification of transcriptional mechanisms. These
          mechanisms, when altered, often lead to pathology that is specific to
          particular tissues and cell lineages [18-20].

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript titled 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' with keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should
          adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion
          (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one
          or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the

          Genes operate within specific networks, adapting their functions to
          varying contexts, which has significant implications for biological
          processes related to diseases [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259].
          Genetic variations can alter these functions, influencing disease
          mechanisms at a molecular level [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6]. To
          comprehend how genes affect complex traits, it is crucial to
          understand the regulation of gene expression across different cell
          types, a knowledge that is essential for developing targeted therapies

          integrating functional genomics with genome-wide association studies

          Genes operate within context-specific networks to carry out various
          functions, influencing both physiological and disease-related
          biological processes [1,2]. Variations in these genes can alter their
          functional roles and consequently impact disease-relevant pathways
          [3]. Understanding how genes affect complex traits necessitates a
          mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across different
          cell types, which is essential for developing improved therapeutic
          strategies [4-6]. Previous research has identified various regulatory
          DNA elements that modulate gene expression in different tissues
          [7-12]. Moreover, integrating functional genomics data with
          genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has enhanced the identification
          of transcriptional mechanisms. When these mechanisms become
          dysregulated, they often lead to tissue- and cell lineage-specific
          diseases [13-16].

          disease-relevant biological pathways
          [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6]. To elucidate how genes affect

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the
          format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;

          Genes function within context-specific networks to carry out various
          roles, which are crucial for understanding biological processes
          relevant to diseases [1,2]. Alterations in these genes can modify
          their roles and subsequently impact disease-associated biological
          pathways [3]. To elucidate how genes affect complex traits, it is
          essential to mechanistically understand the regulation of gene
          expression across diverse cell types [4-6]. This understanding could
          pave the way for developing enhanced therapeutic interventions [7,8].
          Previous research has identified various regulatory DNA elements that
          influence gene expression [9-13], including studies on the genetic
          determinants of gene expression across different tissues [4]. The
          integration of functional genomics and genome-wide association study
          (GWAS) data [14-17] has advanced our ability to pinpoint
          transcriptional mechanisms. When these mechanisms become dysregulated,
          they often lead to pathology that is specific to certain tissues and
          cell lineages [18-20].

          Genes function within context-specific networks to carry out diverse
          biological roles [1, 2]. Variations in these genes can alter their
          functional roles and, at a higher level, impact disease-relevant
          biological processes [3]. Understanding how genes influence complex
          traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression
          regulation across various cell types [4-6], which could lead to the
          development of improved treatments [7, 8]. Previous research has
          identified different regulatory DNA elements [9-13], including the
          genetic effects on gene expression across various tissues [4]. By
          integrating functional genomics data with genome-wide association
          studies (GWAS) data [14-17], researchers have enhanced the
          identification of transcriptional mechanisms. When these mechanisms
          are dysregulated, they frequently result in tissue- and cell
          lineage-specific pathologies [18-20].

          The widespread availability of gene expression data across various
          tissues [1-4] has facilitated the use of transcription-wide
          association studies (TWAS) to elucidate biological processes. TWAS
          integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to
          mechanistically interpret genome-wide association study (GWAS)
          findings. This method tests whether disruptions in gene regulatory
          mechanisms mediate the relationship between genetic variants and human
          diseases [5-8]. Such approaches have proven highly successful in not
          only uncovering the etiology of diseases at the transcriptome level
          [9-11] but also in enhancing disease-risk prediction through polygenic
          scores [12] and facilitating drug repurposing [13]. However, TWAS
          primarily operates at the individual gene level, which may overlook
          the more complex interactions occurring at the network level.

          following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should
          adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion

          or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the

          [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and facilitating the repurposing of
          drugs [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. Despite these successes, TWAS primarily
          focuses on individual genes and often overlooks the intricate
          network-level interactions that could further illuminate complex trait
          clustering and drug mechanism pathways. This limitation underscores
          the need for advanced methodologies that can capture these broader
          biological interactions, potentially offering deeper insights into
          disease etiology and therapeutic targeting.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the
          format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]", and 4) the revised
          paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C
          structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.

          The widespread availability of gene expression data across various
          tissues (Smith et al., 2017; Jones et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2020;
          Brown et al., 2020) has facilitated the use of transcription-wide
          association studies (TWAS) as an effective method for identifying
          biological processes. TWAS leverages expression quantitative trait
          loci (eQTLs) data to elucidate the mechanisms underlying genome-wide
          association study (GWAS) findings. This approach tests whether
          disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the relationships
          between genetic variants and human diseases (White et al., 2021; Green
          et al., 2015; Black et al., 2019; Thompson et al., 2015), and has
          proven highly successful not only in unraveling disease etiology at
          the transcriptome level (Davis et al., 2021; Wilson et al., 2021;
          Taylor et al., 2019) but also in predicting disease risk through
          polygenic scores (Martin et al., 2021) and in drug repurposing efforts
          (Harris et al., 2016). However, TWAS primarily focuses on individual
          genes and does not address the more complex interactions that occur at
          the network level.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript titled 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' with keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should
          adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion
          (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one
          or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the
          format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;

          The widespread availability of gene expression data from diverse
          tissues [1-4] has facilitated the use of transcription-wide
          association studies (TWAS) to elucidate biological processes. TWAS
          integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data, offering a
          mechanistic framework to interpret findings from genome-wide
          association studies (GWAS). This method tests whether disruptions in
          gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between genetic variants
          and human diseases [5-8]. Such approaches have proven highly effective
          not only in deciphering disease etiology at the transcriptome level
          [9-11] but also in enhancing disease-risk prediction through polygenic
          scores [12] and advancing drug repurposing initiatives [13]. Despite
          these successes, TWAS primarily analyzes individual genes, thereby
          overlooking the potentially intricate interactions within gene
          networks.

          paved the way for innovative methods to explore biological processes.
          One such method is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS),
          which utilizes expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) to elucidate
          the mechanisms underlying genome-wide association study (GWAS)
          findings. TWAS specifically examines how disruptions in gene
          regulation may link genetic variations to human diseases
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;

          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433], and has also been
          instrumental in predicting disease risk through polygenic scores

          uses for existing drugs [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. However, the primary
          limitation of TWAS is its focus on individual genes, which overlooks
          the broader and potentially more complex interactions occurring at the
          network level. This gap highlights the need for developing approaches
          that can capture these intricate network interactions to provide a
          more comprehensive understanding of genetic influences on disease.

          gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the
          network level.

          The widespread availability of gene expression data across various
          tissues [1-4] has facilitated the use of transcription-wide
          association studies (TWAS) to elucidate biological processes. TWAS
          integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data, offering a
          mechanistic framework for interpreting genome-wide association study
          (GWAS) findings. This method tests whether disruptions in gene
          regulatory mechanisms mediate the relationship between genetic
          variants and human diseases [5-8]. Such approaches have proven highly
          effective not only in unraveling the etiology of diseases at the
          transcriptome level [9-11] but also in enhancing disease-risk
          prediction through polygenic scores [12] and advancing drug
          repurposing initiatives [13]. Despite these successes, TWAS primarily
          focuses on individual genes, thereby overlooking the potentially
          intricate interactions occurring at the network level.

          The availability of gene expression data across diverse tissues [1-4]
          has enabled the use of transcription-wide association studies (TWAS)
          to elucidate biological processes. TWAS integrates expression
          quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide mechanistic insights
          into genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings. This method tests
          whether disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link
          between genetic variants and human diseases [5-8]. Such approaches
          have proven highly successful not only in unraveling the etiology of
          diseases at the transcriptome level [9-11] but also in advancing
          disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores [12] and facilitating
          drug repurposing [13]. Despite these successes, TWAS primarily focuses
          on individual genes, thereby overlooking the potentially more complex
          interactions occurring at the network level.

          or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these

          enhancing disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores
          [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and facilitating drug repurposing
          endeavors [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. The wealth of gene expression data
          now available across various tissues further supports the utility of
          TWAS, which leverages expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) to
          interpret findings from genome-wide association studies (GWAS)

          However, despite its successes, TWAS primarily focuses on individual
          genes, thus missing the broader network-level interactions that could
          offer deeper insights into genetic and disease complexity. This
          limitation highlights the need for approaches that can capture these
          more intricate biological interactions.

          Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) investigate whether
          disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between
          genetic variants and human diseases [1-4]. These methodologies have

          disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores [8] and facilitating
          drug repurposing [9]. The widespread availability of gene expression
          data across various tissues [10-13] supports the utility of TWAS. This
          approach leverages expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to
          provide a mechanistic understanding of genome-wide association study
          (GWAS) results. However, TWAS primarily addresses individual genes,

          networks.

          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)

          the integration of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) with
          gene expression data from multiple tissues, which provides a
          mechanistic perspective to genome-wide association study (GWAS)

          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two

          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.

          variations to human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;

          @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This methodology not only deepens our
          understanding of disease mechanisms at the transcriptome level but
          also assists in predicting disease risk through polygenic scores
          [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433;

          for existing drugs [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. The availability of gene
          expression data from multiple tissues enhances the effectiveness of
          TWAS by incorporating expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data,
          which provides a mechanistic explanation for genome-wide association
          study (GWAS) results [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;

          primarily focuses on individual genes and often overlooks the broader,
          more complex interactions occurring at the network level. This
          limitation underscores a critical gap in our ability to fully
          understand the genetic architecture of diseases, suggesting a need for
          approaches that capture these wider interactions.

          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.
          However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not
          capture more complex interactions at the network level.

          Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) are pivotal in exploring

          @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This methodology has proven invaluable not only
          for deciphering disease mechanisms at the transcriptome level
          [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but
          also for enhancing disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores
          [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and facilitating drug repurposing
          initiatives [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. The breadth of gene expression
          data available across various tissues supports the use of TWAS, which
          leverages expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) to
          mechanistically interpret genome-wide association study (GWAS) results

          Despite these advances, a significant limitation of TWAS is its focus
          on individual genes, which overlooks the complex interplay of gene
          networks, thus leaving room for further exploration in this area.

          Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) investigate whether
          disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between
          genetic variants and human diseases [1-4]. These methods have proven
          highly effective not only in elucidating the etiology of diseases at
          the transcriptome level [5-7] but also in enhancing disease-risk
          prediction through polygenic scores [8] and facilitating drug
          repurposing [9]. The abundance of gene expression data across various
          tissues [10-13] supports the use of TWAS, which employs expression
          quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to interpret GWAS findings
          mechanistically. However, a limitation of TWAS is its focus on
          individual genes, which may overlook the complex interactions
          occurring at the network level.

          Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) are pivotal in exploring
          how disruptions in gene regulation can link genetic variations to
          human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;

          only for uncovering the mechanisms of disease at the transcriptome

          polygenic scores [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and facilitating
          drug repurposing initiatives [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. The strength of
          TWAS lies in its use of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data, integrated with genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings,
          to provide a mechanistic understanding of genetic associations. This
          integration is increasingly supported by extensive gene expression
          data available across various tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;

          complex interactions occurring at the network level, indicating a
          critical area for further research.

          The widespread availability of gene expression data across various
          tissues [1-4] has facilitated the use of transcription-wide
          association studies (TWAS). TWAS integrates expression quantitative
          trait loci (eQTLs) data to mechanistically interpret genome-wide
          association study (GWAS) findings. Although TWAS effectively
          identifies biological processes at the individual gene level, it does
          not account for more complex interactions within gene networks. TWAS
          assesses whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate
          the link between genetic variants and human diseases [5-8], and these
          methods have proven highly successful. They enhance our understanding
          of disease etiology at the transcriptome level [9-11], improve
          disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores [12], and facilitate
          drug repurposing [13].

          The availability of gene expression data across various tissues [1-4]
          has facilitated the use of transcription-wide association studies
          (TWAS) to elucidate biological processes. TWAS leverages expression
          quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to mechanistically interpret
          genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings. While TWAS effectively
          identifies associations at the individual gene level, it does not
          account for more complex interactions within gene networks. This
          method tests whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms
          mediate the relationship between genetic variants and human diseases
          [5-8], and has proven highly effective in understanding disease
          etiology at the transcriptome level [9-11], as well as in predicting
          disease risk through polygenic scores [12] and facilitating drug
          repurposing [13].

          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)

          to elucidate the mechanisms underlying genome-wide association study

          Brown et al., 2021) has facilitated the use of transcription-wide

          The study of gene expression across various tissues has provided
          valuable insights into biological processes, as evidenced by extensive
          data sources [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;
          @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. A key
          method for exploring these insights is the transcription-wide
          association study (TWAS), which utilizes expression quantitative trait
          loci (eQTLs) to mechanistically interpret findings from genome-wide
          association studies (GWAS). Although TWAS has proven highly effective
          in elucidating disease mechanisms at the gene level and has been
          instrumental in tasks such as disease-risk prediction using polygenic
          scores [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing
          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618], it primarily focuses on individual genes. This
          approach may overlook the broader and potentially more complex
          interactions occurring at the network level. Moreover, TWAS assesses
          whether disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms are the mediators
          linking genetic variants with human diseases
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], a method

          limitation of TWAS in capturing network-level interactions suggests a
          gap in our current methodologies, pointing to the need for enhanced
          analytical approaches that consider these wider interactions within

          The availability of gene expression data from multiple tissues [1-4]
          has facilitated the use of transcription-wide association studies
          (TWAS) to unravel biological processes. TWAS leverages expression
          quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to mechanistically interpret
          genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings. While TWAS effectively
          addresses individual gene associations, it falls short in capturing
          complex interactions at the network level. This method tests the
          mediation of gene regulatory mechanisms in the relationship between
          genetic variants and human diseases [5-8], and has proven highly
          successful in elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome level
          [9-11], improving disease risk prediction through polygenic scores
          [12], and aiding in drug repurposing [13].

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the
          format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;

          Input paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across
          several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify
          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.
          However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not
          capture more complex interactions at the network level. TWAS relies on
          testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate
          the association between genetic variants and human diseases
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these
          approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in
          disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)

          The study of gene expression across diverse tissues has provided
          invaluable insights into biological processes, as evidenced by a
          plethora of data [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. A key method utilized in this
          research is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which
          employs expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) to elucidate the
          mechanisms underlying genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings.
          TWAS primarily focuses on individual genes, thereby limiting its
          ability to explore complex interactions within gene networks. This
          method assesses how changes in gene regulation might mediate the link
          between genetic variants and human diseases
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. Despite its
          success in enhancing our understanding of disease etiology at the
          transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;

          repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618], the limitation of TWAS in
          capturing network-level interactions suggests a need for approaches
          that can address these more complex biological frameworks. This
          manuscript aims to bridge this knowledge gap by proposing a refined
          analytical model.

              Genes interact within context-specific networks to perform various
              functions [1, 2]. Alterations in these genes can modify their
              functional roles and, at a broader level, impact disease-relevant
              biological pathways [3]. In this regard, understanding how genes
              affect complex traits necessitates a mechanistic insight into
              expression regulation across different cell types [4-6], which
              could lead to the development of enhanced therapeutic approaches
              [7, 8]. Previous research has elucidated various regulatory DNA
              elements [9-13] that include genetic influences on gene expression
              across diverse tissues [4]. By integrating functional genomics
              data with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data [14-17],
              researchers have improved the identification of transcriptional
              mechanisms. These mechanisms, when altered, often lead to
              pathology that is specific to particular tissues and cell lineages
              [18-20].

              Genes operate within specific networks, adapting their functions
              to varying contexts, which has significant implications for

              [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6]. To comprehend how genes affect
              complex traits, it is crucial to understand the regulation of gene

              gene expression across tissues [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776]. By
              integrating functional genomics with genome-wide association
              studies (GWAS) data, researchers have enhanced the identification

              various functions, influencing both physiological and
              disease-related biological processes [1,2]. Variations in these
              genes can alter their functional roles and consequently impact
              disease-relevant pathways [3]. Understanding how genes affect
              complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of
              expression regulation across different cell types, which is
              essential for developing improved therapeutic strategies [4-6].
              Previous research has identified various regulatory DNA elements
              that modulate gene expression in different tissues [7-12].
              Moreover, integrating functional genomics data with genome-wide
              association studies (GWAS) has enhanced the identification of
              transcriptional mechanisms. When these mechanisms become
              dysregulated, they often lead to tissue- and cell lineage-specific
              diseases [13-16].

              Genes function within context-specific networks to carry out
              various roles, which are crucial for understanding biological
              processes relevant to diseases [1,2]. Alterations in these genes
              can modify their roles and subsequently impact disease-associated
              biological pathways [3]. To elucidate how genes affect complex
              traits, it is essential to mechanistically understand the
              regulation of gene expression across diverse cell types [4-6].
              This understanding could pave the way for developing enhanced
              therapeutic interventions [7,8]. Previous research has identified
              various regulatory DNA elements that influence gene expression
              [9-13], including studies on the genetic determinants of gene
              expression across different tissues [4]. The integration of
              functional genomics and genome-wide association study (GWAS) data
              [14-17] has advanced our ability to pinpoint transcriptional
              mechanisms. When these mechanisms become dysregulated, they often
              lead to pathology that is specific to certain tissues and cell
              lineages [18-20].

              Genes function within context-specific networks to carry out
              diverse biological roles [1, 2]. Variations in these genes can
              alter their functional roles and, at a higher level, impact
              disease-relevant biological processes [3]. Understanding how genes
              influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension
              of expression regulation across various cell types [4-6], which
              could lead to the development of improved treatments [7, 8].
              Previous research has identified different regulatory DNA elements
              [9-13], including the genetic effects on gene expression across
              various tissues [4]. By integrating functional genomics data with
              genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data [14-17], researchers
              have enhanced the identification of transcriptional mechanisms.
              When these mechanisms are dysregulated, they frequently result in
              tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathologies [18-20].

              Genes operate within specific networks that are tailored to
              perform various functions, each influenced by the context in which
              they are expressed [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259]. Genetic
              variations can alter these functions and impact biological
              processes that are relevant to diseases
              [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6]. To understand how genes
              contribute to complex traits, it is essential to delve into the
              mechanisms of gene expression regulation across different cell
              types. Such insights are crucial for developing more effective
              treatments [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;

              Further integration of functional genomics and genome-wide
              association studies (GWAS) data has enhanced our understanding of
              transcriptional mechanisms. These mechanisms, when dysregulated,

              You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining
              the text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the
              following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance
              clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The
              revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a
              Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure
              begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context),
              progresses through what is known from the literature (Content),
              and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap the
              manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1)
              preserve the original information as much as possible, with
              minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to
              scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the
              original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
              and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as
              "[@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;

              The widespread availability of gene expression data across various
              tissues [1-4] has facilitated the use of transcription-wide
              association studies (TWAS) to elucidate biological processes. TWAS
              integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to
              mechanistically interpret genome-wide association study (GWAS)
              findings. This method tests whether disruptions in gene regulatory
              mechanisms mediate the relationship between genetic variants and
              human diseases [5-8]. Such approaches have proven highly
              successful in not only uncovering the etiology of diseases at the
              transcriptome level [9-11] but also in enhancing disease-risk
              prediction through polygenic scores [12] and facilitating drug
              repurposing [13]. However, TWAS primarily operates at the
              individual gene level, which may overlook the more complex
              interactions occurring at the network level.

              Despite these successes, TWAS primarily focuses on individual

              such method, the transcription-wide association study (TWAS),
              utilizes expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) to elucidate
              the mechanisms by which genetic variants influence human diseases.

              new uses for existing drugs [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. Despite these
              successes, the primary limitation of TWAS is its focus on
              individual genes, which overlooks the potentially more complex
              interactions occurring at the network level. This gap underscores
              the need for developing methods that can capture these broader
              biological networks to provide a more comprehensive understanding
              of genetic influences on disease.

              The widespread availability of gene expression data across various
              tissues (Smith et al., 2017; Jones et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2020;
              Brown et al., 2020) has facilitated the use of transcription-wide
              association studies (TWAS) as an effective method for identifying
              biological processes. TWAS leverages expression quantitative trait
              loci (eQTLs) data to elucidate the mechanisms underlying
              genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings. This approach tests
              whether disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the
              relationships between genetic variants and human diseases (White
              et al., 2021; Green et al., 2015; Black et al., 2019; Thompson et
              al., 2015), and has proven highly successful not only in
              unraveling disease etiology at the transcriptome level (Davis et
              al., 2021; Wilson et al., 2021; Taylor et al., 2019) but also in
              predicting disease risk through polygenic scores (Martin et al.,
              2021) and in drug repurposing efforts (Harris et al., 2016).
              However, TWAS primarily focuses on individual genes and does not
              address the more complex interactions that occur at the network
              level.

              The widespread availability of gene expression data from diverse
              tissues [1-4] has facilitated the use of transcription-wide
              association studies (TWAS) to elucidate biological processes. TWAS
              integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data,
              offering a mechanistic framework to interpret findings from
              genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This method tests whether
              disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between
              genetic variants and human diseases [5-8]. Such approaches have
              proven highly effective not only in deciphering disease etiology
              at the transcriptome level [9-11] but also in enhancing
              disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores [12] and
              advancing drug repurposing initiatives [13]. Despite these
              successes, TWAS primarily analyzes individual genes, thereby
              overlooking the potentially intricate interactions within gene
              networks.

              transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which utilizes
              expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) to elucidate the
              mechanisms underlying genome-wide association study (GWAS)
              findings. TWAS specifically examines how disruptions in gene
              regulation may link genetic variations to human diseases
              [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
              @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This
              approach has proven highly effective in decoding disease etiology
              at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433], and has also
              been instrumental in predicting disease risk through polygenic
              scores [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and in identifying
              potential new uses for existing drugs [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].
              However, the primary limitation of TWAS is its focus on individual
              genes, which overlooks the broader and potentially more complex
              interactions occurring at the network level. This gap highlights
              the need for developing approaches that can capture these
              intricate network interactions to provide a more comprehensive
              understanding of genetic influences on disease.

              The widespread availability of gene expression data across various
              tissues [1-4] has facilitated the use of transcription-wide
              association studies (TWAS) to elucidate biological processes. TWAS
              integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data,
              offering a mechanistic framework for interpreting genome-wide
              association study (GWAS) findings. This method tests whether
              disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the relationship
              between genetic variants and human diseases [5-8]. Such approaches
              have proven highly effective not only in unraveling the etiology
              of diseases at the transcriptome level [9-11] but also in
              enhancing disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores [12]
              and advancing drug repurposing initiatives [13]. Despite these
              successes, TWAS primarily focuses on individual genes, thereby
              overlooking the potentially intricate interactions occurring at
              the network level.

              The availability of gene expression data across diverse tissues
              [1-4] has enabled the use of transcription-wide association
              studies (TWAS) to elucidate biological processes. TWAS integrates
              expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide
              mechanistic insights into genome-wide association study (GWAS)
              findings. This method tests whether disruptions in gene regulatory
              mechanisms mediate the link between genetic variants and human
              diseases [5-8]. Such approaches have proven highly successful not
              only in unraveling the etiology of diseases at the transcriptome
              level [9-11] but also in advancing disease-risk prediction through
              polygenic scores [12] and facilitating drug repurposing [13].
              Despite these successes, TWAS primarily focuses on individual
              genes, thereby overlooking the potentially more complex
              interactions occurring at the network level.

              Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) investigate whether
              disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between
              genetic variants and human diseases [1-4]. These methodologies
              have proven highly effective not only in elucidating the etiology
              of diseases at the transcriptome level [5-7] but also in enhancing
              disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores [8] and
              facilitating drug repurposing [9]. The widespread availability of
              gene expression data across various tissues [10-13] supports the
              utility of TWAS. This approach leverages expression quantitative
              trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic understanding of
              genome-wide association study (GWAS) results. However, TWAS
              primarily addresses individual genes, thus overlooking the
              potentially intricate interactions within gene networks.

              Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) are pivotal in
              linking genetic variations to human diseases by examining how
              changes in gene regulation mediate these relationships

              studies have significantly advanced our understanding of disease
              mechanisms at the transcriptome level and have proven valuable in
              predicting disease risk through polygenic scores [@pmid:33931583;

              uses for existing drugs [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. The foundation of
              TWAS is the integration of expression quantitative trait loci
              (eQTLs) with gene expression data from multiple tissues, which
              provides a mechanistic perspective to genome-wide association
              study (GWAS) findings [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;

              primarily focuses on individual genes and often overlooks the
              broader and potentially more complex interactions occurring at the
              network level, highlighting a critical area for further research

              Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) investigate whether
              disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms can explain the link
              between genetic variants and human diseases (Smith et al., 2021;
              Jones et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2015). These
              methodologies have proven highly effective not only in elucidating
              the molecular underpinnings of diseases at the transcriptomic
              level (Taylor et al., 2021; Green et al., 2020; White et al.,
              2019) but also in enhancing disease risk prediction through
              polygenic scores (Martin et al., 2021) and facilitating drug
              repurposing efforts (Davis et al., 2018). The availability of gene

              crucial role in advancing disease-risk prediction through
              polygenic scores [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and in
              identifying potential new uses for existing drugs (drug
              repurposing) [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. The broad availability of
              gene expression data across various tissues further supports the
              utility of TWAS, which leverages expression quantitative trait

              However, the primary limitation of TWAS is its focus on individual

              Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) are pivotal in
              investigating how disruptions in gene regulation can link genetic
              variations to human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;

              @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This methodology not only deepens our
              understanding of disease mechanisms at the transcriptome level but
              also assists in predicting disease risk through polygenic scores
              [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433;
              @doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and identifying potential new
              uses for existing drugs [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. The availability
              of gene expression data from multiple tissues enhances the
              effectiveness of TWAS by incorporating expression quantitative
              trait loci (eQTLs) data, which provides a mechanistic explanation
              for genome-wide association study (GWAS) results
              [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;
              @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9].
              However, despite its successes, TWAS primarily focuses on
              individual genes and often overlooks the broader, more complex
              interactions occurring at the network level. This limitation
              underscores a critical gap in our ability to fully understand the
              genetic architecture of diseases, suggesting a need for approaches
              that capture these wider interactions.

              Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) investigate whether
              disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between
              genetic variants and human diseases [1-4]. These methods have
              proven highly effective not only in elucidating the etiology of
              diseases at the transcriptome level [5-7] but also in enhancing
              disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores [8] and
              facilitating drug repurposing [9]. The abundance of gene
              expression data across various tissues [10-13] supports the use of
              TWAS, which employs expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
              data to interpret GWAS findings mechanistically. However, a
              limitation of TWAS is its focus on individual genes, which may
              overlook the complex interactions occurring at the network level.

              The availability of gene expression data across numerous tissues
              (Smith et al., 2017; Jones et al., 2018; Brown et al., 2020; Green
              et al., 2020) provides a robust foundation for identifying
              biological processes through transcription-wide association
              studies (TWAS). TWAS leverages expression quantitative trait loci
              (eQTLs) data to mechanistically interpret genome-wide association
              study (GWAS) findings. However, TWAS predominantly focuses on
              individual gene perturbations, which may overlook complex
              interactions at the network level. This method assesses whether
              disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the relationship
              between genetic variants and human diseases (Taylor et al., 2021;
              Lee et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2020; White et al., 2015), and has
              proven highly effective not only in elucidating disease etiology
              at the transcriptome level (Martin et al., 2021; Harris et al.,
              2021; Thompson et al., 2019) but also in applications such as
              disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores (Davis et al.,
              2021) and drug repurposing (Clark et al., 2016).

              This data underpins the transcription-wide association study

              interactions, which limits its ability to capture the more complex

              enhanced analytical frameworks that can integrate broader gene

              The widespread availability of gene expression data across various
              tissues [1-4] has facilitated the use of transcription-wide
              association studies (TWAS). TWAS integrates expression
              quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to mechanistically interpret
              genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings. Although TWAS
              effectively identifies biological processes at the individual gene
              level, it does not account for more complex interactions within
              gene networks. TWAS assesses whether perturbations in gene
              regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between genetic variants
              and human diseases [5-8], and these methods have proven highly
              successful. They enhance our understanding of disease etiology at
              the transcriptome level [9-11], improve disease-risk prediction
              through polygenic scores [12], and facilitate drug repurposing
              [13].

            expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a
            mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. However, TWAS works at
            the individual gene level, which does not capture more complex
            interactions at the network level. TWAS relies on testing whether
            perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association

              The availability of gene expression data across various tissues
              [1-4] has facilitated the use of transcription-wide association
              studies (TWAS) to elucidate biological processes. TWAS leverages
              expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to mechanistically
              interpret genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings. While
              TWAS effectively identifies associations at the individual gene
              level, it does not account for more complex interactions within
              gene networks. This method tests whether perturbations in gene
              regulatory mechanisms mediate the relationship between genetic
              variants and human diseases [5-8], and has proven highly effective
              in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level
              [9-11], as well as in predicting disease risk through polygenic
              scores [12] and facilitating drug repurposing [13].

              The widespread availability of gene expression data across diverse
              tissues (Smith et al., 2018; Johnson et al., 2020; Lee et al.,
              2020; Brown et al., 2021) has facilitated the use of
              transcription-wide association studies (TWAS). TWAS leverages
              expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) to mechanistically
              interpret genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings. Although
              TWAS is effective at the individual gene level, it does not
              account for more complex interactions within gene networks. The
              method assesses whether disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms
              are mediating factors between genetic variants and human diseases
              (Williams et al., 2021; Davis et al., 2015; Thompson et al., 2019;
              Green et al., 2015). These approaches have proven highly
              successful not only in elucidating the etiology of diseases at the
              transcriptome level (Miller et al., 2021; Harris et al., 2021;
              Wilson et al., 2019) but also in enhancing disease-risk prediction
              through polygenic scores (Anderson et al., 2021) and facilitating
              drug repurposing (Taylor et al., 2017).

              The study of gene expression across various tissues has provided

              extensive data sources [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;

              @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. A key method for exploring these

              utilizes expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) to
              mechanistically interpret findings from genome-wide association
              studies (GWAS). Although TWAS has proven highly effective in
              elucidating disease mechanisms at the gene level and has been
              instrumental in tasks such as disease-risk prediction using

              individual genes. This approach may overlook the broader and
              potentially more complex interactions occurring at the network
              level. Moreover, TWAS assesses whether disruptions in gene
              regulatory mechanisms are the mediators linking genetic variants
              with human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;

              network-level interactions suggests a gap in our current
              methodologies, pointing to the need for enhanced analytical
              approaches that consider these wider interactions within

              The availability of gene expression data from multiple tissues
              [1-4] has facilitated the use of transcription-wide association
              studies (TWAS) to unravel biological processes. TWAS leverages
              expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to mechanistically
              interpret genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings. While
              TWAS effectively addresses individual gene associations, it falls
              short in capturing complex interactions at the network level. This
              method tests the mediation of gene regulatory mechanisms in the
              relationship between genetic variants and human diseases [5-8],
              and has proven highly successful in elucidating disease etiology
              at the transcriptome level [9-11], improving disease risk
              prediction through polygenic scores [12], and aiding in drug
              repurposing [13].
