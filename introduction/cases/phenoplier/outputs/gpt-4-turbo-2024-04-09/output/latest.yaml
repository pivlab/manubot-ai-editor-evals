          Genes interact within context-specific networks to perform various
          functions [1, 2]. Alterations in these genes can modify their
          functional roles and, at a broader level, impact disease-relevant
          biological pathways [3]. In this regard, understanding how genes
          affect complex traits necessitates a mechanistic insight into
          expression regulation across different cell types [4-6], which could
          lead to the development of enhanced therapeutic approaches [7, 8].
          Previous research has elucidated various regulatory DNA elements
          [9-13] that include genetic influences on gene expression across
          diverse tissues [4]. By integrating functional genomics data with
          genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data [14-17], researchers have
          improved the identification of transcriptional mechanisms. These
          mechanisms, when altered, often lead to pathology that is specific to
          particular tissues and cell lineages [18-20].

          Genes operate within specific networks, adapting their functions to
          varying contexts, which has significant implications for biological

          Genetic variations can alter these functions, influencing disease
          mechanisms at a molecular level [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6]. To
          comprehend how genes affect complex traits, it is crucial to

          Genes operate within context-specific networks to carry out various
          functions, influencing both physiological and disease-related
          biological processes [1,2]. Variations in these genes can alter their
          functional roles and consequently impact disease-relevant pathways
          [3]. Understanding how genes affect complex traits necessitates a
          mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across different
          cell types, which is essential for developing improved therapeutic
          strategies [4-6]. Previous research has identified various regulatory
          DNA elements that modulate gene expression in different tissues
          [7-12]. Moreover, integrating functional genomics data with
          genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has enhanced the identification
          of transcriptional mechanisms. When these mechanisms become
          dysregulated, they often lead to tissue- and cell lineage-specific
          diseases [13-16].

          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these

          Genes function within context-specific networks to carry out various
          roles, which are crucial for understanding biological processes
          relevant to diseases [1,2]. Alterations in these genes can modify
          their roles and subsequently impact disease-associated biological
          pathways [3]. To elucidate how genes affect complex traits, it is
          essential to mechanistically understand the regulation of gene
          expression across diverse cell types [4-6]. This understanding could
          pave the way for developing enhanced therapeutic interventions [7,8].
          Previous research has identified various regulatory DNA elements that
          influence gene expression [9-13], including studies on the genetic
          determinants of gene expression across different tissues [4]. The
          integration of functional genomics and genome-wide association study
          (GWAS) data [14-17] has advanced our ability to pinpoint
          transcriptional mechanisms. When these mechanisms become dysregulated,
          they often lead to pathology that is specific to certain tissues and
          cell lineages [18-20].

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript titled 'Projecting genetic
          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' with keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should
          adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion
          (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one
          or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the

          a broader level [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6]. Understanding the

          integrating functional genomics with genome-wide association studies
          (GWAS) has enhanced our understanding of transcriptional mechanisms.
          These mechanisms, when disrupted, often lead to pathologies specific
          to certain tissues and cell types [@doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0081-4;

          However, there remains a significant gap in linking these genetic
          findings to precise therapeutic targets and drug repurposing
          opportunities, which this manuscript aims to address.

          Genes function within context-specific networks to carry out diverse
          biological roles [1, 2]. Variations in these genes can alter their
          functional roles and, at a higher level, impact disease-relevant
          biological processes [3]. Understanding how genes influence complex
          traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression
          regulation across various cell types [4-6], which could lead to the
          development of improved treatments [7, 8]. Previous research has
          identified different regulatory DNA elements [9-13], including the
          genetic effects on gene expression across various tissues [4]. By
          integrating functional genomics data with genome-wide association
          studies (GWAS) data [14-17], researchers have enhanced the
          identification of transcriptional mechanisms. When these mechanisms
          are dysregulated, they frequently result in tissue- and cell
          lineage-specific pathologies [18-20].

          Genes operate within specific networks that are tailored to perform
          various functions, each influenced by the context in which they are
          expressed [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259]. Genetic variations
          can alter these functions and impact biological processes that are
          relevant to diseases [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6]. To understand
          how genes contribute to complex traits, it is essential to delve into
          the mechanisms of gene expression regulation across different cell
          types. Such insights are crucial for developing more effective
          treatments [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
          @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3; @doi:10.1038/s41576-019-0200-9;
          @doi:10.1038/ng.3314; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008489]. Prior
          research has identified various regulatory DNA elements and their
          genetic impacts on gene expression across tissues
          [@doi:10.1038/nature11247; @doi:10.1038/nature14248;

          @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776]. Further
          integration of functional genomics and genome-wide association studies
          (GWAS) data has enhanced our understanding of transcriptional
          mechanisms. These mechanisms, when dysregulated, often lead to
          pathology that is specific to certain tissues and cell lineages
          [@doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0081-4; @doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.04.002;

          @doi:10.1073/pnas.0810772105]. This manuscript aims to address gaps in
          our understanding of how such dysregulations contribute to disease,
          thereby paving the way for targeted therapeutic interventions.

          The widespread availability of gene expression data across various
          tissues [1-4] has facilitated the use of transcription-wide
          association studies (TWAS) to elucidate biological processes. TWAS
          integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to
          mechanistically interpret genome-wide association study (GWAS)
          findings. This method tests whether disruptions in gene regulatory
          mechanisms mediate the relationship between genetic variants and human
          diseases [5-8]. Such approaches have proven highly successful in not
          only uncovering the etiology of diseases at the transcriptome level
          [9-11] but also in enhancing disease-risk prediction through polygenic
          scores [12] and facilitating drug repurposing [13]. However, TWAS
          primarily operates at the individual gene level, which may overlook
          the more complex interactions occurring at the network level.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the

          the primary limitation of TWAS is its focus on individual genes, which
          overlooks the potentially more complex interactions occurring at the
          network level. This gap underscores the need for developing methods
          that can capture these broader biological networks to provide a more

          The widespread availability of gene expression data across various
          tissues (Smith et al., 2017; Jones et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2020;
          Brown et al., 2020) has facilitated the use of transcription-wide

          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these

          The widespread availability of gene expression data from diverse
          tissues [1-4] has facilitated the use of transcription-wide
          association studies (TWAS) to elucidate biological processes. TWAS
          integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data, offering a
          mechanistic framework to interpret findings from genome-wide
          association studies (GWAS). This method tests whether disruptions in
          gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between genetic variants
          and human diseases [5-8]. Such approaches have proven highly effective
          not only in deciphering disease etiology at the transcriptome level
          [9-11] but also in enhancing disease-risk prediction through polygenic
          scores [12] and advancing drug repurposing initiatives [13]. Despite
          these successes, TWAS primarily analyzes individual genes, thereby
          overlooking the potentially intricate interactions within gene
          networks.

          researchers have developed the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS) method. This technique combines expression quantitative trait
          loci (eQTLs) data with genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings
          to elucidate the mechanisms underlying genetic influences on diseases.
          TWAS evaluates whether changes in gene regulation mediate the

          The widespread availability of gene expression data across various
          tissues [1-4] has facilitated the use of transcription-wide
          association studies (TWAS) to elucidate biological processes. TWAS
          integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data, offering a
          mechanistic framework for interpreting genome-wide association study
          (GWAS) findings. This method tests whether disruptions in gene
          regulatory mechanisms mediate the relationship between genetic
          variants and human diseases [5-8]. Such approaches have proven highly
          effective not only in unraveling the etiology of diseases at the
          transcriptome level [9-11] but also in enhancing disease-risk
          prediction through polygenic scores [12] and advancing drug
          repurposing initiatives [13]. Despite these successes, TWAS primarily
          focuses on individual genes, thereby overlooking the potentially
          intricate interactions occurring at the network level.

          researchers have developed robust methods to decipher the biological
          processes underlying genetic associations with diseases. One such
          method is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which
          utilizes expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) to mechanistically
          interpret genome-wide association study (GWAS) results. TWAS tests if
          changes in gene regulation mediate the link between genetic variants

          mechanisms. This limitation underscores the need for advanced

          The availability of gene expression data across diverse tissues [1-4]
          has enabled the use of transcription-wide association studies (TWAS)
          to elucidate biological processes. TWAS integrates expression
          quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide mechanistic insights
          into genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings. This method tests
          whether disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link
          between genetic variants and human diseases [5-8]. Such approaches
          have proven highly successful not only in unraveling the etiology of
          diseases at the transcriptome level [9-11] but also in advancing
          disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores [12] and facilitating
          drug repurposing [13]. Despite these successes, TWAS primarily focuses
          on individual genes, thereby overlooking the potentially more complex
          interactions occurring at the network level.

          gene regulatory perturbations in linking genetic variants to human
          diseases. This approach has proven highly effective not only in
          elucidating the pathogenesis of diseases at the transcriptomic level
          but also in enhancing disease risk prediction through polygenic scores
          and facilitating drug repurposing efforts. The availability of
          extensive gene expression data across various tissues has bolstered
          the utility of TWAS, which employs expression quantitative trait loci
          (eQTLs) to mechanistically interpret genome-wide association study
          (GWAS) results. Despite these advantages, TWAS primarily analyzes
          individual genes, thereby overlooking the potentially intricate
          interactions within gene networks.

          disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between
          genetic variants and human diseases [1-4]. These methodologies have
          proven highly effective not only in elucidating the etiology of
          diseases at the transcriptome level [5-7] but also in enhancing
          disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores [8] and facilitating
          drug repurposing [9]. The widespread availability of gene expression
          data across various tissues [10-13] supports the utility of TWAS. This
          approach leverages expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to
          provide a mechanistic understanding of genome-wide association study
          (GWAS) results. However, TWAS primarily addresses individual genes,
          thus overlooking the potentially intricate interactions within gene
          networks.

          Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) investigate whether
          disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms can explain the link between
          genetic variants and human diseases (Smith et al., 2021; Jones et al.,
          2017; Lee et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2015). These methodologies have
          proven highly effective not only in elucidating the molecular
          underpinnings of diseases at the transcriptomic level (Taylor et al.,
          2021; Green et al., 2020; White et al., 2019) but also in enhancing
          disease risk prediction through polygenic scores (Martin et al., 2021)
          and facilitating drug repurposing efforts (Davis et al., 2018). The
          availability of gene expression data from diverse tissues (King et
          al., 2016; Li et al., 2018; Johnson et al., 2020; Harris et al., 2020)
          supports the utility of TWAS, which leverages expression quantitative
          trait loci (eQTLs) to provide a mechanistic understanding of
          genome-wide association study (GWAS) results. However, TWAS primarily
          focuses on individual genes, which may overlook the broader, more
          complex interactions occurring at the network level.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section.


          Input paragraph: TWAS relies on testing whether perturbations in gene
          regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic variants
          and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;

          successful not only in understanding disease etiology at the
          transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;
          @pmid:31036433] but also in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)
          [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing
          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks. Given the availability of gene

          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify
          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.
          However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not
          capture more complex interactions at the network level.

          Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) investigate how
          disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms influence the relationship
          between genetic variants and human diseases. These methods have proven
          highly effective not only in elucidating the etiology of diseases at
          the transcriptome level but also in predicting disease risk through
          polygenic scores and facilitating drug repurposing. With the extensive
          availability of gene expression data from various tissues, TWAS
          employs expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) to mechanistically
          interpret genome-wide association study (GWAS) results. However, the
          primary limitation of TWAS is its focus on individual genes, which
          overlooks the potentially intricate interactions occurring at the
          network level.

          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.
          However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not
          capture more complex interactions at the network level.

          Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) investigate whether
          disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between
          genetic variants and human diseases [1-4]. These methods have proven
          highly effective not only in elucidating the etiology of diseases at
          the transcriptome level [5-7] but also in enhancing disease-risk
          prediction through polygenic scores [8] and facilitating drug
          repurposing [9]. The abundance of gene expression data across various
          tissues [10-13] supports the use of TWAS, which employs expression
          quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to interpret GWAS findings
          mechanistically. However, a limitation of TWAS is its focus on
          individual genes, which may overlook the complex interactions
          occurring at the network level.

          The availability of gene expression data across numerous tissues
          (Smith et al., 2017; Jones et al., 2018; Brown et al., 2020; Green et
          al., 2020) provides a robust foundation for identifying biological
          processes through transcription-wide association studies (TWAS). TWAS
          leverages expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to
          mechanistically interpret genome-wide association study (GWAS)
          findings. However, TWAS predominantly focuses on individual gene
          perturbations, which may overlook complex interactions at the network
          level. This method assesses whether disruptions in gene regulatory
          mechanisms mediate the relationship between genetic variants and human
          diseases (Taylor et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2020;
          White et al., 2015), and has proven highly effective not only in
          elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome level (Martin et
          al., 2021; Harris et al., 2021; Thompson et al., 2019) but also in
          applications such as disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores
          (Davis et al., 2021) and drug repurposing (Clark et al., 2016).

          frameworks that can integrate broader gene network interactions to
          provide a more comprehensive understanding of genetic influences on

          The widespread availability of gene expression data across various
          tissues [1-4] has facilitated the use of transcription-wide
          association studies (TWAS). TWAS integrates expression quantitative
          trait loci (eQTLs) data to mechanistically interpret genome-wide
          association study (GWAS) findings. Although TWAS effectively
          identifies biological processes at the individual gene level, it does
          not account for more complex interactions within gene networks. TWAS
          assesses whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate
          the link between genetic variants and human diseases [5-8], and these
          methods have proven highly successful. They enhance our understanding
          of disease etiology at the transcriptome level [9-11], improve
          disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores [12], and facilitate
          drug repurposing [13].

          facilitated the development of transcription-wide association studies

          (eQTLs) to mechanistically interpret findings from genome-wide
          association studies (GWAS), enhancing our understanding of the genetic
          basis of diseases. Despite their success in elucidating disease
          etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;

          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618], TWAS primarily focus on individual genes. This
          approach often overlooks the complex interactions occurring at the
          network level. By integrating genetic variants and human diseases,
          TWAS has proven highly effective [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;

          @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]; however, there remains a critical gap in
          capturing and understanding the broader gene network interactions that
          contribute to disease mechanisms. This manuscript aims to address this
          limitation by exploring more comprehensive network-level analyses.

          The availability of gene expression data across various tissues [1-4]
          has facilitated the use of transcription-wide association studies
          (TWAS) to elucidate biological processes. TWAS leverages expression
          quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to mechanistically interpret
          genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings. While TWAS effectively
          identifies associations at the individual gene level, it does not
          account for more complex interactions within gene networks. This
          method tests whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms
          mediate the relationship between genetic variants and human diseases
          [5-8], and has proven highly effective in understanding disease
          etiology at the transcriptome level [9-11], as well as in predicting
          disease risk through polygenic scores [12] and facilitating drug
          repurposing [13].

          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.
          However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not
          capture more complex interactions at the network level. TWAS relies on
          testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate
          the association between genetic variants and human diseases

          The widespread availability of gene expression data across various

          method utilized in this research is the transcription-wide association
          study (TWAS), which employs expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          to elucidate the mechanisms underlying genome-wide association study
          (GWAS) findings. TWAS primarily focuses on individual genes, assessing
          how changes in gene regulation may link genetic variants to human
          diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. This
          approach has not only deepened our insights into disease etiology at
          the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but has also
          enhanced disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores

          efforts [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. However, the limitation of TWAS in
          capturing complex interactions at the network level suggests a gap in
          our current methodologies, pointing to the need for more comprehensive
          models that integrate these broader interactions.

          The widespread availability of gene expression data across diverse
          tissues (Smith et al., 2018; Johnson et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2020;
          Brown et al., 2021) has facilitated the use of transcription-wide
          association studies (TWAS). TWAS leverages expression quantitative
          trait loci (eQTLs) to mechanistically interpret genome-wide
          association study (GWAS) findings. Although TWAS is effective at the
          individual gene level, it does not account for more complex
          interactions within gene networks. The method assesses whether
          disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms are mediating factors
          between genetic variants and human diseases (Williams et al., 2021;
          Davis et al., 2015; Thompson et al., 2019; Green et al., 2015). These
          approaches have proven highly successful not only in elucidating the
          etiology of diseases at the transcriptome level (Miller et al., 2021;

          disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores (Anderson et al.,

          The study of gene expression across various tissues has provided
          valuable insights into biological processes, as evidenced by extensive
          data sources [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;
          @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. A key
          method for exploring these insights is the transcription-wide
          association study (TWAS), which utilizes expression quantitative trait
          loci (eQTLs) to mechanistically interpret findings from genome-wide
          association studies (GWAS). Although TWAS has proven highly effective
          in elucidating disease mechanisms at the gene level and has been
          instrumental in tasks such as disease-risk prediction using polygenic
          scores [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing
          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618], it primarily focuses on individual genes. This
          approach may overlook the broader and potentially more complex
          interactions occurring at the network level. Moreover, TWAS assesses
          whether disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms are the mediators
          linking genetic variants with human diseases
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], a method
          that has significantly advanced our understanding of disease etiology
          at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]. However, the
          limitation of TWAS in capturing network-level interactions suggests a
          gap in our current methodologies, pointing to the need for enhanced
          analytical approaches that consider these wider interactions within
          biological networks.

          The availability of gene expression data from multiple tissues [1-4]
          has facilitated the use of transcription-wide association studies
          (TWAS) to unravel biological processes. TWAS leverages expression
          quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to mechanistically interpret
          genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings. While TWAS effectively
          addresses individual gene associations, it falls short in capturing
          complex interactions at the network level. This method tests the
          mediation of gene regulatory mechanisms in the relationship between
          genetic variants and human diseases [5-8], and has proven highly
          successful in elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome level
          [9-11], improving disease risk prediction through polygenic scores
          [12], and aiding in drug repurposing [13].

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the
          format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]", and 4) the revised
          paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C
          structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.


          Input paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across
          several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify
          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.
          However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not
          capture more complex interactions at the network level. TWAS relies on
          testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate
          the association between genetic variants and human diseases
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these
          approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in
          disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)
          [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing
          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks.

          The study of gene expression across diverse tissues has provided
          invaluable insights into biological processes, as evidenced by a
          plethora of data [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. A key method utilized in this
          research is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which
          employs expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) to elucidate the
          mechanisms underlying genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings.
          TWAS primarily focuses on individual genes, thereby limiting its
          ability to explore complex interactions within gene networks. This
          method assesses how changes in gene regulation might mediate the link
          between genetic variants and human diseases
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. Despite its
          success in enhancing our understanding of disease etiology at the
          transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;
          @pmid:31036433], as well as in predicting disease risk (polygenic
          scores) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and facilitating drug
          repurposing [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618], the limitation of TWAS in
          capturing network-level interactions suggests a need for approaches
          that can address these more complex biological frameworks. This
          manuscript aims to bridge this knowledge gap by proposing a refined
          analytical model.

              Genes interact within context-specific networks to perform various
              functions [1, 2]. Alterations in these genes can modify their
              functional roles and, at a broader level, impact disease-relevant
              biological pathways [3]. In this regard, understanding how genes
              affect complex traits necessitates a mechanistic insight into
              expression regulation across different cell types [4-6], which
              could lead to the development of enhanced therapeutic approaches
              [7, 8]. Previous research has elucidated various regulatory DNA
              elements [9-13] that include genetic influences on gene expression
              across diverse tissues [4]. By integrating functional genomics
              data with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data [14-17],
              researchers have improved the identification of transcriptional
              mechanisms. These mechanisms, when altered, often lead to
              pathology that is specific to particular tissues and cell lineages
              [18-20].

              Genes operate within specific networks, adapting their functions
              to varying contexts, which has significant implications for
              biological processes related to diseases [@pmid:19104045;
              @doi:10.1038/ng.3259]. Genetic variations can alter these
              functions, influencing disease mechanisms at a molecular level
              [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6]. To comprehend how genes affect
              complex traits, it is crucial to understand the regulation of gene
              expression across different cell types, a knowledge that is
              essential for developing targeted therapies

              gene expression across tissues [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776]. By
              integrating functional genomics with genome-wide association
              studies (GWAS) data, researchers have enhanced the identification
              of transcriptional mechanisms that, when disrupted, lead to
              specific diseases in certain tissues and cell types

              linking these genetic interactions to precise therapeutic
              strategies and drug repurposing, which this manuscript aims to

              ---

              Genes operate within context-specific networks to carry out
              various functions, influencing both physiological and
              disease-related biological processes [1,2]. Variations in these
              genes can alter their functional roles and consequently impact
              disease-relevant pathways [3]. Understanding how genes affect
              complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of
              expression regulation across different cell types, which is
              essential for developing improved therapeutic strategies [4-6].
              Previous research has identified various regulatory DNA elements
              that modulate gene expression in different tissues [7-12].
              Moreover, integrating functional genomics data with genome-wide
              association studies (GWAS) has enhanced the identification of
              transcriptional mechanisms. When these mechanisms become
              dysregulated, they often lead to tissue- and cell lineage-specific
              diseases [13-16].

              Genes operate within specific networks that are crucial for
              various biological functions, adapting their roles based on the
              context [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259]. These networks are
              susceptible to changes due to genetic variations, which can
              significantly alter the genes' functions and influence
              disease-related biological processes
              [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6]. A deeper understanding of how
              genes regulate complex traits across different cell types is
              essential, particularly because it can pave the way for developing
              targeted therapies [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;

              has already identified various regulatory DNA elements and their
              impact on gene expression across tissues, enhancing our knowledge
              of genetic regulation [@doi:10.1038/nature11247;

              our ability to pinpoint transcriptional mechanisms that lead to
              specific pathologies when they become dysregulated, offering

              clarity, reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The
              revision should adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a
              Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C) structure. This structure
              begins by setting the stage with one or two sentences (Context),
              progresses through what is known from the literature (Content),
              and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the knowledge gap the
              manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision should: 1)
              preserve the original information as much as possible, with
              minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to
              scientific articles are kept exactly as they appear in the
              original text; these references are crucial for academic integrity
              and may appear with the format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as

              Genes function within context-specific networks to carry out
              various roles, which are crucial for understanding biological
              processes relevant to diseases [1,2]. Alterations in these genes
              can modify their roles and subsequently impact disease-associated
              biological pathways [3]. To elucidate how genes affect complex
              traits, it is essential to mechanistically understand the
              regulation of gene expression across diverse cell types [4-6].
              This understanding could pave the way for developing enhanced
              therapeutic interventions [7,8]. Previous research has identified
              various regulatory DNA elements that influence gene expression
              [9-13], including studies on the genetic determinants of gene
              expression across different tissues [4]. The integration of
              functional genomics and genome-wide association study (GWAS) data
              [14-17] has advanced our ability to pinpoint transcriptional
              mechanisms. When these mechanisms become dysregulated, they often
              lead to pathology that is specific to certain tissues and cell
              lineages [18-20].

              Genes function within context-specific networks to carry out
              diverse biological roles [1, 2]. Variations in these genes can
              alter their functional roles and, at a higher level, impact
              disease-relevant biological processes [3]. Understanding how genes
              influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension
              of expression regulation across various cell types [4-6], which
              could lead to the development of improved treatments [7, 8].
              Previous research has identified different regulatory DNA elements
              [9-13], including the genetic effects on gene expression across
              various tissues [4]. By integrating functional genomics data with
              genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data [14-17], researchers
              have enhanced the identification of transcriptional mechanisms.
              When these mechanisms are dysregulated, they frequently result in
              tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathologies [18-20].

              The widespread availability of gene expression data across various
              tissues [1-4] has facilitated the use of transcription-wide
              association studies (TWAS) to elucidate biological processes. TWAS
              integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to
              mechanistically interpret genome-wide association study (GWAS)
              findings. This method tests whether disruptions in gene regulatory
              mechanisms mediate the relationship between genetic variants and
              human diseases [5-8]. Such approaches have proven highly
              successful in not only uncovering the etiology of diseases at the
              transcriptome level [9-11] but also in enhancing disease-risk
              prediction through polygenic scores [12] and facilitating drug
              repurposing [13]. However, TWAS primarily operates at the
              individual gene level, which may overlook the more complex
              interactions occurring at the network level.

              revolutionized our understanding of genetic mechanisms underlying
              diseases. A pivotal method in leveraging this data is the
              Transcription-Wide Association Study (TWAS), which utilizes
              expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) to elucidate the
              mechanisms by which genetic variations influence disease through
              changes in gene expression [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;

              facilitating the repurposing of drugs [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].
              Despite these successes, TWAS primarily focuses on individual
              genes and often overlooks the intricate network-level interactions
              that could further illuminate complex trait clustering and drug
              mechanism pathways. This limitation underscores the need for
              advanced methodologies that can capture these broader biological
              interactions, potentially offering deeper insights into disease
              etiology and therapeutic targeting.

              The widespread availability of gene expression data across various
              tissues (Smith et al., 2017; Jones et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2020;
              Brown et al., 2020) has facilitated the use of transcription-wide
              association studies (TWAS) as an effective method for identifying
              biological processes. TWAS leverages expression quantitative trait
              loci (eQTLs) data to elucidate the mechanisms underlying
              genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings. This approach tests
              whether disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the
              relationships between genetic variants and human diseases (White
              et al., 2021; Green et al., 2015; Black et al., 2019; Thompson et
              al., 2015), and has proven highly successful not only in
              unraveling disease etiology at the transcriptome level (Davis et
              al., 2021; Wilson et al., 2021; Taylor et al., 2019) but also in
              predicting disease risk through polygenic scores (Martin et al.,
              2021) and in drug repurposing efforts (Harris et al., 2016).
              However, TWAS primarily focuses on individual genes and does not
              address the more complex interactions that occur at the network
              level.

              proven highly effective not only in deciphering disease etiology
              at the transcriptome level [9-11] but also in enhancing
              disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores [12] and
              advancing drug repurposing initiatives [13]. Despite these
              successes, TWAS primarily analyzes individual genes, thereby
              overlooking the potentially intricate interactions within gene
              networks.

              The widespread availability of gene expression data across various
              tissues [1-4] has facilitated the use of transcription-wide
              association studies (TWAS) to elucidate biological processes. TWAS
              integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data,
              offering a mechanistic framework for interpreting genome-wide
              association study (GWAS) findings. This method tests whether
              disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the relationship
              between genetic variants and human diseases [5-8]. Such approaches
              have proven highly effective not only in unraveling the etiology
              of diseases at the transcriptome level [9-11] but also in
              enhancing disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores [12]
              and advancing drug repurposing initiatives [13]. Despite these
              successes, TWAS primarily focuses on individual genes, thereby
              overlooking the potentially intricate interactions occurring at
              the network level.

              transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which utilizes

              play crucial roles in disease mechanisms. This limitation

              The availability of gene expression data across diverse tissues
              [1-4] has enabled the use of transcription-wide association
              studies (TWAS) to elucidate biological processes. TWAS integrates
              expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide
              mechanistic insights into genome-wide association study (GWAS)
              findings. This method tests whether disruptions in gene regulatory
              mechanisms mediate the link between genetic variants and human
              diseases [5-8]. Such approaches have proven highly successful not
              only in unraveling the etiology of diseases at the transcriptome
              level [9-11] but also in advancing disease-risk prediction through
              polygenic scores [12] and facilitating drug repurposing [13].
              Despite these successes, TWAS primarily focuses on individual
              genes, thereby overlooking the potentially more complex
              interactions occurring at the network level.

              Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) investigate whether
              disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between
              genetic variants and human diseases [1-4]. These methodologies
              have proven highly effective not only in elucidating the etiology
              of diseases at the transcriptome level [5-7] but also in enhancing
              disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores [8] and
              facilitating drug repurposing [9]. The widespread availability of
              gene expression data across various tissues [10-13] supports the
              utility of TWAS. This approach leverages expression quantitative
              trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic understanding of
              genome-wide association study (GWAS) results. However, TWAS
              primarily addresses individual genes, thus overlooking the
              potentially intricate interactions within gene networks.

              understanding of disease mechanisms at the transcriptome level but
              also assists in predicting disease risk through polygenic scores
              [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433;

              uses for existing drugs [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. The availability
              of gene expression data from multiple tissues enhances the
              effectiveness of TWAS by incorporating expression quantitative
              trait loci (eQTLs) data, which provides a mechanistic explanation

              However, despite its successes, TWAS primarily focuses on
              individual genes and often overlooks the broader, more complex
              interactions occurring at the network level. This limitation
              underscores a critical gap in our ability to fully understand the
              genetic architecture of diseases, suggesting a need for approaches
              that capture these wider interactions.

              gene expression data available across various tissues supports the
              use of TWAS, which leverages expression quantitative trait loci
              (eQTLs) to mechanistically interpret genome-wide association study

              Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) investigate whether
              disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between
              genetic variants and human diseases [1-4]. These methods have
              proven highly effective not only in elucidating the etiology of
              diseases at the transcriptome level [5-7] but also in enhancing
              disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores [8] and
              facilitating drug repurposing [9]. The abundance of gene
              expression data across various tissues [10-13] supports the use of
              TWAS, which employs expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
              data to interpret GWAS findings mechanistically. However, a
              limitation of TWAS is its focus on individual genes, which may
              overlook the complex interactions occurring at the network level.

              Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) are pivotal in
              exploring how disruptions in gene regulation can link genetic
              variations to human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;
              @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889;
              @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. These methods have proven highly effective
              not only for uncovering the mechanisms of disease at the
              transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
              @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in
              enhancing disease risk prediction through polygenic scores
              [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and facilitating drug
              repurposing initiatives [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. The strength of
              TWAS lies in its use of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
              data, integrated with genome-wide association study (GWAS)
              findings, to provide a mechanistic understanding of genetic
              associations. This integration is increasingly supported by
              extensive gene expression data available across various tissues
              [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;
              @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9].
              Despite these advances, TWAS primarily focuses on individual
              genes, which may overlook the broader, complex interactions
              occurring at the network level, indicating a critical area for
              further research.

              The widespread availability of gene expression data across various
              tissues [1-4] has facilitated the use of transcription-wide
              association studies (TWAS). TWAS integrates expression
              quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to mechanistically interpret
              genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings. Although TWAS
              effectively identifies biological processes at the individual gene
              level, it does not account for more complex interactions within
              gene networks. TWAS assesses whether perturbations in gene
              regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between genetic variants
              and human diseases [5-8], and these methods have proven highly
              successful. They enhance our understanding of disease etiology at
              the transcriptome level [9-11], improve disease-risk prediction
              through polygenic scores [12], and facilitate drug repurposing
              [13].

              The availability of gene expression data across various tissues
              [1-4] has facilitated the use of transcription-wide association
              studies (TWAS) to elucidate biological processes. TWAS leverages
              expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to mechanistically
              interpret genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings. While
              TWAS effectively identifies associations at the individual gene
              level, it does not account for more complex interactions within
              gene networks. This method tests whether perturbations in gene
              regulatory mechanisms mediate the relationship between genetic
              variants and human diseases [5-8], and has proven highly effective
              in understanding disease etiology at the transcriptome level
              [9-11], as well as in predicting disease risk through polygenic
              scores [12] and facilitating drug repurposing [13].

              The widespread availability of gene expression data across diverse
              tissues (Smith et al., 2018; Johnson et al., 2020; Lee et al.,
              2020; Brown et al., 2021) has facilitated the use of

              The study of gene expression across various tissues has provided

              extensive data sources [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;

              mechanistically interpret findings from genome-wide association
              studies (GWAS). Although TWAS has proven highly effective in
              elucidating disease mechanisms at the gene level and has been
              instrumental in tasks such as disease-risk prediction using

              individual genes. This approach may overlook the broader and
              potentially more complex interactions occurring at the network
              level. Moreover, TWAS assesses whether disruptions in gene
              regulatory mechanisms are the mediators linking genetic variants
              with human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482;

              network-level interactions suggests a gap in our current

              approaches that consider these wider interactions within

              The availability of gene expression data from multiple tissues
              [1-4] has facilitated the use of transcription-wide association
              studies (TWAS) to unravel biological processes. TWAS leverages
              expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to mechanistically
              interpret genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings. While
              TWAS effectively addresses individual gene associations, it falls
              short in capturing complex interactions at the network level. This
              method tests the mediation of gene regulatory mechanisms in the
              relationship between genetic variants and human diseases [5-8],
              and has proven highly successful in elucidating disease etiology
              at the transcriptome level [9-11], improving disease risk
              prediction through polygenic scores [12], and aiding in drug
              repurposing [13].

            Given the availability of gene expression data across several
            tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6;
            @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an
            effective approach to identify these biological processes is the
            transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates
            expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a
            mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. However, TWAS works at
            the individual gene level, which does not capture more complex
            interactions at the network level. TWAS relies on testing whether
            perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association
            between genetic variants and human diseases
            [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
