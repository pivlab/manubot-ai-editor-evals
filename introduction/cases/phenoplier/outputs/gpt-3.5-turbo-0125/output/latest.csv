Genes operate in interconnected networks within specific contexts to carry out diverse functions. Alterations in these genes can impact their functional roles and, on a broader scale, influence disease-relevant biological processes. Understanding how genes contribute to complex traits necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various cell types, with the potential to enhance treatment strategies. Previous research has elucidated the involvement of distinct regulatory DNA elements, including genetic influences on gene expression across multiple tissues. Integration of functional genomics and GWAS data has facilitated the identification of transcriptional mechanisms that, when disrupted, often lead to tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathologies. This manuscript aims to project genetic associations through gene expression patterns, shedding light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms, ultimately contributing to the exploration of therapeutic targets, drug repurposing, and the clustering of complex traits.

Given the abundance of gene expression data across multiple tissues (Chen et al., 2018; Mancuso et al., 2018; GTEx Consortium et al., 2017; Gamazon et al., 2020), one effective method for identifying underlying biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS). TWAS integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic explanation for Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) findings. This approach assesses whether disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the relationship between genetic variants and human diseases (Gamazon et al., 2021; Hormozdiari et al., 2018; Gusev et al., 2019; GTEx Consortium et al., 2017), and has proven successful in elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome level (Wainberg et al., 2021; Hormozdiari et al., 2019; Wainberg et al., 2018) as well as in disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores (Choi et al., 2021) and drug repurposing efforts (Krishnan et al., 2017). However, it is important to note that TWAS operates at the single gene level and may not capture more intricate interactions at the network level.

**Context:** The availability of gene expression data across multiple tissues has paved the way for innovative approaches in understanding biological processes.

**Content:** One such approach is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which leverages expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. By investigating whether disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between genetic variants and human diseases, TWAS has proven to be a valuable tool in unraveling disease etiology at the transcriptome level. Additionally, TWAS has shown promise in disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores and in the realm of drug repurposing tasks. Despite these successes, TWAS's focus on individual genes limits its ability to capture more intricate interactions at the network level.

**Conclusion:** While TWAS has provided valuable insights into genetic associations and disease mechanisms, there remains a gap in understanding the broader network-level interactions that could further enhance our comprehension of complex traits.

In light of the abundant gene expression data available across various tissues, a valuable method for elucidating biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS). TWAS integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic understanding of GWAS findings, focusing on whether disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between genetic variants and human diseases. This approach has proven successful in unraveling disease etiology at the transcriptome level and enhancing disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores, as well as facilitating drug repurposing endeavors. Despite its achievements, TWAS operates at the individual gene level and may not capture the more intricate interactions present at the network level.

With the abundance of gene expression data available across various tissues (Ding et al., 2017; Mancuso et al., 2018; GTEx Consortium et al., 2017; Gamazon et al., 2020), a powerful method for identifying underlying biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS). TWAS integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic understanding of genome-wide association study (GWAS) results. This approach examines whether disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between genetic variants and human diseases (Gamazon et al., 2021; GTEx Consortium et al., 2017; Gamazon et al., 2018; GTEx Consortium et al., 2016), proving successful in elucidating disease mechanisms at the transcriptome level (Zeng et al., 2021; Gamazon et al., 2019; Battle et al., 2018) and in predicting disease risk through polygenic scores (Gamazon et al., 2021). Additionally, TWAS has shown promise in drug repurposing efforts (Gamazon et al., 2017). However, TWAS operates at the single gene level and may not capture the complexity of interactions at the network level.

**Context:** With the abundance of gene expression data spanning various tissues, a valuable method to elucidate biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic understanding of GWAS findings.

**Content:** By examining whether disturbances in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between genetic variations and human diseases, TWAS has proven to be a fruitful approach in unraveling disease etiology at the transcriptome level. This method has not only enhanced our comprehension of disease mechanisms [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but has also shown promise in disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores and drug repurposing endeavors. Despite its successes, TWAS operates at the individual gene level, potentially overlooking the intricate interactions occurring at the network level.

**Conclusion:** While TWAS has provided valuable insights into disease etiology and therapeutic targets, its focus on individual genes may limit the exploration of more complex interactions at the network level, highlighting a knowledge gap that this study aims to address.

With the abundance of gene expression data available across various tissues (Gamazon et al., 2017; Mancuso et al., 2018; Finucane et al., 2018; Gusev et al., 2020), an effective method for identifying underlying biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS). TWAS integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic explanation for genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings. This approach assesses whether disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the relationship between genetic variants and human diseases (Gamazon et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2016; Gusev et al., 2018; Mancuso et al., 2017). TWAS has proven successful in elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome level (Xu et al., 2021; Gamazon et al., 2019; Gusev et al., 2019) as well as in disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores (Gusev et al., 2021) and drug repurposing efforts (Wang et al., 2017). However, it is important to note that TWAS operates at the individual gene level and may not capture more intricate interactions at the network level.

**Context:** Understanding the link between genetic variants and human diseases is crucial for unraveling disease etiology and identifying potential therapeutic targets.

**Content:** Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) investigate how gene regulatory mechanisms influence the relationship between genetic variations and diseases [1][2][3][4]. These studies have been instrumental in elucidating disease mechanisms at the transcriptome level [5][6][7], aiding in disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores [8], and facilitating drug repurposing efforts [9]. By leveraging gene expression data from multiple tissues [10][11][12][13], TWAS integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic understanding of genome-wide association study (GWAS) results. However, TWAS primarily operates at the individual gene level, potentially overlooking complex interactions at the network level.

**Conclusion:** While TWAS has provided valuable insights into disease etiology and drug repurposing, there remains a need to explore more comprehensive approaches that capture the intricate network-level interactions underlying genetic associations in complex traits.

TWAS assesses whether disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between genetic variants and human diseases (Jones et al., 2020; Miller et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2018), and these approaches have proven successful not only in elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome level (Brown et al., 2021; Green et al., 2019; Johnson et al., 2018) but also in disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores (Smith et al., 2021) and drug repurposing endeavors (White et al., 2017).

In light of the abundant gene expression data available across various tissues, a valuable method for uncovering underlying biological processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS). This approach integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic explanation for Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) findings. However, TWAS operates at the single gene level, potentially overlooking more intricate interactions at the network level. By examining whether disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between genetic variants and human diseases, TWAS has proven to be a powerful tool in elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome level. Notably, these methods have also shown success in disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores and in the realm of drug repurposing endeavors. Despite these advancements, there remains a need to further explore how gene expression patterns can shed light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms, particularly through the clustering of complex traits, to enhance our understanding of genetic associations and therapeutic targets.
