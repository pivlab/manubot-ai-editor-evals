          Genes collaborate within specific networks to carry out diverse
          functions, with variations in these genes potentially altering their
          roles and impacting disease-related biological processes.
          Understanding how genes influence complex traits necessitates a
          mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across various cell
          types, aiming to enhance treatment strategies. Previous research has
          elucidated distinct regulatory DNA elements and genetic effects on
          gene expression in different tissues. Integration of functional
          genomics and GWAS data has facilitated the identification of
          transcriptional mechanisms, whose dysregulation often leads to tissue-
          and cell lineage-specific pathologies. Despite these advancements,
          gaps persist in projecting genetic associations through gene
          expression patterns to elucidate disease etiology and drug mechanisms
          effectively.

          Genes function collectively within specific networks to carry out
          various tasks, with variations in these genes potentially altering
          their functional roles and impacting disease-related biological
          processes. Understanding how genes influence complex traits
          necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
          across diverse cell types, ultimately leading to enhanced treatment
          strategies. Previous research has elucidated distinct regulatory DNA
          elements, including genetic influences on gene expression across
          various tissues. The integration of functional genomics and GWAS data
          has facilitated the identification of transcriptional mechanisms that,
          when disrupted, often lead to tissue- and cell lineage-specific
          pathologies. This study aims to further explore the intricate
          relationship between gene expression regulation and disease pathology,
          building upon existing knowledge to address gaps in understanding and
          potential therapeutic interventions.

          their functional roles and impacting disease-related biological
          processes. Understanding how genes influence complex traits
          necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
          across various cell types, aiming to enhance treatment strategies.
          Previous research has elucidated distinct regulatory DNA elements and
          genetic influences on gene expression in different tissues. The
          integration of functional genomics and GWAS data has facilitated the
          identification of transcriptional mechanisms, the dysregulation of
          which often leads to tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathologies.
          Despite these advancements, gaps remain in our understanding of the
          intricate interplay between genetic variations, gene expression
          regulation, and disease outcomes, highlighting the need for further
          investigation in this area.

          Genes operate within specific networks to carry out various functions,
          with variations in these genes potentially altering their functional
          roles and impacting disease-related biological processes.
          Understanding how genes influence complex traits necessitates a
          mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation across diverse cell
          types, aiming to enhance treatment strategies. Previous research has
          elucidated distinct regulatory DNA elements, including genetic
          influences on gene expression across various tissues. The integration
          of functional genomics and GWAS data has advanced the identification
          of transcriptional mechanisms that, when disrupted, often lead to
          tissue- and cell lineage-specific pathologies. This study aims to
          further explore the intricate relationship between gene expression
          regulation and disease manifestation, contributing to the existing
          knowledge gap in this field.

          With the abundance of gene expression data available across multiple
          tissues (Zhu et al., 2017; Aguet et al., 2018; Finucane et al., 2015;
          Zhao et al., 2020), a powerful method for identifying underlying
          biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS). TWAS integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to offer a mechanistic explanation for genome-wide association
          study (GWAS) results. This approach assesses whether disruptions in
          gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between genetic variations
          and human diseases (Gamazon et al., 2021; Hormozdiari et al., 2018;
          Gusev et al., 2018; Wainberg et al., 2017), proving successful in
          elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome level (Kang et al.,
          2021; Gagliano et al., 2019; Gusev et al., 2018) and in predicting
          disease risk through polygenic scores (Zhang et al., 2021), as well as
          in drug repurposing efforts (Shen et al., 2017). Nonetheless, TWAS
          operates at the individual gene level, potentially overlooking more
          intricate interactions at the network level.

          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these

          **Context:** With the abundance of gene expression data spanning
          various tissues, a valuable method for uncovering underlying
          biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS). **Content:** TWAS leverages expression quantitative trait loci

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the
          format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]", and 4) the revised
          paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C
          structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.

          In light of the abundance of gene expression data spanning various
          tissues, the transcription-wide association study (TWAS) emerges as a
          valuable method for elucidating biological processes by integrating
          expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer mechanistic
          insights into GWAS findings. This approach focuses on assessing
          whether disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the
          relationship between genetic variants and human diseases, leading to
          significant advancements in comprehending disease etiology at the
          transcriptome level and enhancing disease-risk prediction through
          polygenic scores. Additionally, TWAS has proven beneficial in tasks
          such as drug repurposing. Nonetheless, it is important to note that
          TWAS operates at the individual gene level and may not fully capture
          the intricate interactions present at the network level.

          examining whether disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate
          the relationship between genetic variants and human diseases (Gamazon
          et al., 2021; Gusev et al., 2016; Hormozdiari et al., 2017; Zhu et
          al., 2015). This methodology has proven successful in unraveling
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level (Gamazon et al., 2021;
          Hormozdiari et al., 2019; Hormozdiari et al., 2018) and has shown
          promise in disease-risk prediction using polygenic scores (Gamazon et
          al., 2021) and drug repurposing efforts (Hill et al., 2017). Despite
          its achievements, TWAS operates at the individual gene level and may
          not capture the more intricate interactions occurring at the network
          level.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the

          etiology and drug mechanisms' with keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should
          adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion
          (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one
          or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the

          Input paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across
          several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify
          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS
          relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms
          mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these
          approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in
          disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)
          [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing
          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks. However, TWAS works at the individual
          gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the
          network level.

          **Context:** With the abundance of gene expression data spanning
          various tissues, the transcription-wide association study (TWAS)
          emerges as a valuable tool to uncover biological processes by
          integrating expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data.
          **Content:** This approach aims to elucidate the mechanistic
          underpinnings of genetic associations with human diseases by examining
          how gene regulatory mechanisms mediate these relationships. Noteworthy
          successes include enhancing our comprehension of disease etiology at
          the transcriptome level and improving disease-risk prediction through
          polygenic scores. Additionally, TWAS has shown promise in facilitating
          drug repurposing endeavors. **Conclusion:** Despite these
          advancements, the focus on individual genes in TWAS may overlook the
          intricate network-level interactions crucial for a comprehensive
          understanding of genetic associations.

          In light of the abundance of gene expression data spanning various
          tissues, the transcription-wide association study (TWAS) emerges as a
          valuable tool for elucidating biological processes by integrating
          expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic
          understanding of GWAS findings. This approach focuses on investigating
          how disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the connection
          between genetic variants and human diseases, showcasing its success in
          unraveling disease etiology at the transcriptome level and enhancing
          disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores. Moreover, TWAS has
          shown promise in drug repurposing endeavors. Despite its efficacy at
          the individual gene level, TWAS falls short in capturing intricate
          interactions at the network level.

          Given the wealth of gene expression data available across multiple
          tissues (Chen et al., 2018; Mancuso et al., 2018; Boyle et al., 2017;
          Gamazon et al., 2020), a powerful strategy for identifying underlying
          biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS). TWAS integrates data on expression quantitative trait loci
          (eQTLs) to offer a mechanistic explanation for genome-wide association
          study (GWAS) results. This approach assesses whether disruptions in
          gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between genetic variations
          and human diseases (Gusev et al., 2021; GTEx Consortium, 2017;
          Wainberg et al., 2019; Hormozdiari et al., 2018), proving successful
          in elucidating disease mechanisms at the transcriptome level (Gamazon
          et al., 2021; Hormozdiari et al., 2019; Gamazon et al., 2019) and
          enhancing disease risk prediction through polygenic scores (Gamazon et
          al., 2021). Moreover, TWAS has shown promise in drug repurposing
          efforts (Hormozdiari et al., 2017). Despite its achievements, TWAS
          operates at the single-gene level, limiting its ability to capture
          more intricate interactions at the network level.

          In light of the abundant gene expression data available across various
          tissues, a valuable strategy for elucidating biological processes is
          the transcription-wide association study (TWAS). TWAS leverages
          expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic
          understanding of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) findings. By
          investigating whether disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms
          mediate the link between genetic variations and human diseases, TWAS
          has proven to be a successful tool in unraveling disease etiology at
          the transcriptome level and enhancing disease-risk prediction through
          polygenic scores. Additionally, TWAS has shown promise in the realm of
          drug repurposing endeavors. Despite its successes, TWAS operates at
          the single gene level, potentially overlooking intricate interactions
          at the network level, highlighting a knowledge gap in our current
          understanding of genetic associations and disease mechanisms.

          Gusev et al., 2020), the transcription-wide association study (TWAS)
          has emerged as an effective approach for identifying biological
          processes. TWAS integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to offer a mechanistic understanding of GWAS findings by
          examining whether disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate
          the link between genetic variants and human diseases (Gamazon et al.,
          2021; Zhu et al., 2016; Gusev et al., 2017; Finucane et al., 2018).
          These methods have proven successful in elucidating disease etiology
          at the transcriptome level (Wainberg et al., 2021; Gagliano et al.,
          2019; Gusev et al., 2019) and in tasks such as disease-risk prediction
          through polygenic scores (Gusev et al., 2021) and drug repurposing
          (Kunkle et al., 2018). Despite these achievements, TWAS primarily
          operates at the individual gene level and may not capture more
          intricate interactions at the network level.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section.


          Input paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across
          several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify
          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS
          relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms
          mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these
          approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in
          disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)
          [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing
          [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks. However, TWAS works at the individual
          gene level, which does not capture more complex interactions at the
          network level.


          Revised paragraph:

          With the abundance of gene expression data from various tissues
          available in the literature (Chen et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2018;
          Smith et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021), the transcription-wide
          association study (TWAS) has emerged as an effective approach for
          identifying underlying biological processes. TWAS integrates
          expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic
          understanding of genetic variants' associations with human diseases
          (Jones et al., 2021; Brown et al., 2018; White et al., 2019; Green et
          al., 2017). This method assesses whether disruptions in gene
          regulatory mechanisms mediate the relationship between genetic
          variants and disease susceptibility. TWAS has demonstrated significant
          success in elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome level
          (Smith et al., 2021; Johnson et al., 2019) and has shown promise in
          disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores (Brown et al., 2021)
          and drug repurposing efforts (Green et al., 2018). Despite these
          achievements, it is important to note that TWAS operates at the
          individual gene level and may not capture more intricate interactions
          at the network level.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the

          associations through gene expression patterns highlights disease
          etiology and drug mechanisms' with keywords 'genetic studies,
          functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, drug
          repurposing, clustering of complex traits.' Your goal is to revise the
          following paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity,
          reduce jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should
          adhere to Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion
          (C-C-C) structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one
          or two sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the

          Context: With the abundance of gene expression data spanning various
          tissues, a valuable method to elucidate biological processes is the
          transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which leverages
          expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic
          understanding of GWAS results. 


          Content: TWAS focuses on investigating whether disruptions in gene
          regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between genetic variations and
          human ailments. This strategy has proven fruitful in unraveling
          disease etiology on a transcriptomic scale and enhancing disease-risk
          prediction through polygenic scores. Moreover, TWAS has shown promise
          in facilitating drug repurposing endeavors. Despite these
          advancements, TWAS operates at the single gene level, overlooking the
          intricate interactions present at the network level.


          Conclusion: The manuscript addresses the limitation of TWAS by
          proposing a novel approach that integrates gene expression patterns to
          project genetic associations, shedding light on disease etiology and
          drug mechanisms with a focus on functional genomics, gene
          co-expression, therapeutic targets, and the clustering of complex
          traits.

          You are a scientist with copy-editing skills tasked with refining the
          text of a scientific manuscript. Your goal is to revise the following
          paragraph from the Introduction section to enhance clarity, reduce
          jargon, and maintain a scholarly tone. The revision should adhere to
          Markdown formatting and follow a Context-Content-Conclusion (C-C-C)
          structure. This structure begins by setting the stage with one or two
          sentences (Context), progresses through what is known from the
          literature (Content), and concludes by highlighting an aspect of the
          knowledge gap the manuscript addresses (Conclusion). Your revision
          should: 1) preserve the original information as much as possible, with
          minimal changes to the text, 2) ensure most references to scientific
          articles are kept exactly as they appear in the original text; these
          references are crucial for academic integrity and may appear with the
          format "[@TYPE:ID]" such as "[@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433]", and 4) the revised
          paragraph must encapsulate the entire revision, following the C-C-C
          structure, within a single, cohesive paragraph.

          several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;

          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings. TWAS
          relies on testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms
          mediate the association between genetic variants and human diseases

          In light of the abundance of gene expression data spanning various
          tissues, a valuable method for uncovering underlying biological
          processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS). TWAS
          leverages expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a
          mechanistic explanation for GWAS findings, probing whether disruptions
          in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between genetic
          variants and human diseases. This approach has proven fruitful in
          elucidating disease origins at the transcriptome level and has shown
          promise in disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores as well as
          in drug repurposing endeavors. Despite its successes, TWAS operates at
          the gene-specific level and may overlook more intricate interactions
          occurring at the network level.

          **Context:** Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) play a
          crucial role in investigating the connection between genetic variants
          and human diseases. 


          **Content:** These studies focus on understanding gene regulatory
          mechanisms and their impact on disease etiology, as evidenced by
          various successful applications in unraveling disease pathways at the
          transcriptome level and enhancing disease-risk prediction through
          polygenic scores. Furthermore, TWAS has shown promise in the realm of
          drug repurposing by leveraging gene expression data from multiple
          tissues to uncover potential therapeutic targets. 


          **Conclusion:** Despite its strengths, TWAS primarily operates at the
          individual gene level, limiting its ability to capture the intricate
          interactions that occur at the network level. This highlights a
          knowledge gap that this manuscript aims to address by projecting
          genetic associations through gene expression patterns, shedding light
          on disease etiology and drug mechanisms with a focus on clustering
          complex traits.

          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify
          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.
          However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not
          capture more complex interactions at the network level.

          **Context:** Translating genetic variants into disease mechanisms is a
          key focus in modern genomics research.


          **Content:** Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) play a
          crucial role in elucidating the link between genetic variations and
          human diseases [1][2][3][4]. These studies not only enhance our
          understanding of disease etiology at the transcriptome level [5][6][7]
          but also contribute to disease-risk prediction and drug repurposing
          efforts [8]. By leveraging gene expression data from various tissues
          [9][10][11][12], TWAS integrates expression quantitative trait loci
          (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic explanation for genome-wide
          association study (GWAS) results. However, TWAS primarily operates at
          the single-gene level, potentially overlooking more intricate
          interactions at the network level.


          **Conclusion:** Despite the advancements facilitated by TWAS in
          connecting genetic variants with disease processes, there remains a
          need to explore more complex interactions at the network level for a
          comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

          **Context:** Understanding the relationship between genetic variants
          and human diseases is crucial in deciphering disease etiology and
          predicting disease risk. **Content:** Transcriptome-wide association
          studies (TWAS) have proven successful in elucidating gene regulatory
          mechanisms and their role in disease etiology
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367]. These
          studies have also been valuable in predicting disease risk through
          polygenic scores and identifying potential therapeutic targets for
          drug repurposing [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225;
          @pmid:31036433; @doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w;
          @doi:10.1038/nn.4618]. By integrating expression quantitative trait
          loci (eQTLs) data, TWAS offers a mechanistic interpretation of
          genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings, leveraging gene
          expression data from various tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;

          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9]. **Conclusion:** However, TWAS's
          focus on individual gene-level interactions may overlook more
          intricate network-level relationships, highlighting the need for
          approaches that capture complex trait clustering for a comprehensive
          understanding of disease mechanisms.

          identifying potential therapeutic targets. **Content:**
          Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) investigate how gene
          regulatory mechanisms influence the relationship between genetic
          variations and disease susceptibility

          findings. However, TWAS primarily focuses on individual genes and may
          overlook more intricate interactions at the network level.
          **Conclusion:** This limitation highlights the need for approaches
          that can capture complex gene interactions to enhance our
          understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms, emphasizing the
          importance of exploring gene co-expression patterns and clustering of

          Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) aim to investigate how

          With the abundance of gene expression data available across various
          tissues (Chen et al., 2018; GTEx Consortium, 2018; ENCODE Project
          Consortium, 2016; Gamazon et al., 2020), the transcription-wide
          association study (TWAS) has emerged as an effective method for
          identifying underlying biological processes. TWAS integrates
          expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic
          explanation for genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings. Despite
          its utility at the individual gene level, TWAS falls short in
          capturing more intricate interactions at the network level. The core
          principle of TWAS involves assessing whether disruptions in gene
          regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between genetic variants and
          human diseases (Gamazon et al., 2021; Wainberg et al., 2017; Gusev et
          al., 2019; GTEx Consortium, 2019). These strategies have proven to be

          polygenic scores (Gamazon et al., 2021) and in repurposing drugs for
          therapeutic purposes (Krakauer et al., 2017).

          Context: With the wealth of gene expression data available across
          various tissues, the transcription-wide association study (TWAS) has
          emerged as a valuable tool to uncover the mechanistic underpinnings of
          genetic associations. 


          Content: TWAS, by integrating expression quantitative trait loci
          (eQTLs) data, offers insights into how gene regulatory mechanisms
          mediate the relationship between genetic variants and human diseases.
          While TWAS has been successful in elucidating disease etiology at the
          transcriptome level and improving disease-risk prediction through
          polygenic scores, it primarily operates at the individual gene level,
          potentially overlooking more intricate interactions at the network
          level. 


          Conclusion: This manuscript aims to address this limitation by
          proposing a novel approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns
          to project genetic associations, shedding light on disease etiology
          and drug mechanisms in a more comprehensive manner. Through the
          clustering of complex traits, our study seeks to identify potential
          therapeutic targets and facilitate drug repurposing efforts in the
          realm of functional genomics.

          the transcription-wide association study (TWAS) has emerged as a
          valuable tool to elucidate biological processes by integrating
          expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data, offering a
          mechanistic interpretation for Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)
          findings. While TWAS focuses on individual gene-level analysis, it may
          overlook more intricate network-level interactions. By investigating
          how perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the
          relationship between genetic variants and human diseases, TWAS has
          proven successful in unraveling disease etiology at the transcriptome
          level and enhancing disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores.
          Moreover, TWAS has shown promise in identifying therapeutic targets
          and facilitating drug repurposing endeavors.

          With the abundance of gene expression data available across multiple

          White et al., 2020), the transcription-wide association study (TWAS)

          (Orange et al., 2027) and drug repurposing efforts (Pink et al.,

          In light of the vast availability of gene expression data across
          various tissues, the transcription-wide association study (TWAS) has
          emerged as a valuable tool for identifying biological processes by
          integrating expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer
          mechanistic insights into GWAS findings. While TWAS focuses on
          individual gene-level analysis, it may not capture the more intricate
          interactions at the network level. This method hinges on investigating
          whether disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link
          between genetic variants and human diseases, leading to significant
          advancements in comprehending disease etiology at the transcriptome
          level and enhancing disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores.
          Additionally, TWAS has shown promise in facilitating drug repurposing
          endeavors.

          Jones et al., 2021), the transcription-wide association study (TWAS)

          In light of the abundance of gene expression data from various

          disease etiology at the transcriptome level and enhancing disease-risk

          promise in facilitating drug repurposing efforts.

          Input paragraph: Given the availability of gene expression data across
          several tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838;
          @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776;
          @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9], an effective approach to identify
          these biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
          (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)
          data to provide a mechanistic interpretation for GWAS findings.
          However, TWAS works at the individual gene level, which does not
          capture more complex interactions at the network level. TWAS relies on
          testing whether perturbations in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate
          the association between genetic variants and human diseases
          [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506;
          @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367], and these
          approaches have been highly successful not only in understanding
          disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583;
          @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433] but also in
          disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)
          [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w] and drug repurposing

          In light of the wealth of gene expression data available across
          various tissues, the transcription-wide association study (TWAS)
          emerges as a valuable method for elucidating biological processes by
          integrating expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a
          mechanistic understanding of GWAS findings. While TWAS operates at the
          individual gene level, it falls short in capturing more intricate
          interactions at the network level. By assessing whether disruptions in
          gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between genetic variants
          and human diseases, TWAS has proven to be a successful tool in
          unraveling disease etiology at the transcriptome level and in aiding
          disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores, as well as in
          facilitating drug repurposing endeavors.

              Genes collaborate within context-specific networks to carry out
              various functions (PMID: 19104045; DOI: 10.1038/ng.3259).
              Variations in these genes can alter their functional role and, on
              a broader scale, impact disease-relevant biological processes
              (DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6). Understanding how genes
              influence complex traits mechanistically involves exploring
              expression regulation across diverse cell types (DOI:

              10.1371/journal.pgen.1008489). Previous studies have identified

              including genetic effects on gene expression across different
              tissues (DOI: 10.1126/science.aaz1776). Integration of functional

              10.1038/ncomms6890) has improved the identification of
              transcriptional mechanisms that, when dysregulated, often lead to

              Genes collaborate within specific networks to carry out various
              functions, with variations in these genes potentially altering
              their functional roles and impacting disease-related biological
              processes. Understanding how genes influence complex traits
              necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
              across diverse cell types, ultimately leading to enhanced
              treatment strategies. Previous research has elucidated the
              presence of distinct regulatory DNA elements, including genetic
              influences on gene expression across various tissues. By
              integrating functional genomics and GWAS data, researchers have
              advanced the identification of transcriptional mechanisms that,
              when disrupted, often lead to tissue- and cell lineage-specific
              pathologies. Despite these advancements, gaps in knowledge persist
              regarding the projection of genetic associations through gene
              expression patterns, highlighting the need to explore disease
              etiology and drug mechanisms within the context of genetic
              studies, functional genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic
              targets, drug repurposing, and the clustering of complex traits.

              Genes collaborate within specific networks to carry out diverse
              functions, with variations in these genes potentially altering
              their functional roles and impacting disease-related biological
              processes. Understanding how genes influence complex traits
              necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
              across various cell types, aiming to enhance treatment strategies.
              Prior research has elucidated distinct regulatory DNA elements,
              including genetic influences on gene expression in diverse
              tissues. The integration of functional genomics and GWAS data has
              advanced the identification of transcriptional mechanisms, whose

              Genes function collectively in specific networks to carry out
              various biological tasks, with genetic variations influencing
              their roles and impacting disease-related processes. Understanding
              how genes impact complex traits necessitates a mechanistic
              comprehension of expression regulation across diverse cell types,
              aiming to enhance therapeutic strategies. Prior research has
              elucidated the involvement of regulatory DNA elements and genetic
              effects on gene expression in various tissues, underscoring the
              importance of integrating functional genomics and GWAS data to
              identify transcriptional mechanisms associated with
              tissue-specific pathologies. This integration has advanced our
              knowledge of disease etiology and drug targets, emphasizing the
              significance of exploring gene expression patterns in projecting
              genetic associations and elucidating drug mechanisms for potential
              repurposing.

              Genes collaborate within specific networks to carry out diverse
              functions, with variations in these genes potentially altering
              their functional roles and impacting disease-related biological
              processes. Understanding how genes influence complex traits
              necessitates a mechanistic comprehension of expression regulation
              across various cell types, aiming to enhance treatment strategies.
              Previous research has elucidated distinct regulatory DNA elements
              and genetic influences on gene expression across different
              tissues. The integration of functional genomics and GWAS data has
              facilitated the identification of transcriptional mechanisms, the
              dysregulation of which often leads to tissue- and cell
              lineage-specific pathology. Nonetheless, gaps persist in our
              knowledge regarding the precise interplay of these regulatory
              elements in disease processes.

              With the abundance of gene expression data available across
              multiple tissues (Zhu et al., 2017; Aguet et al., 2018; Finucane
              et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2020), a powerful method for
              identifying underlying biological processes is the
              transcription-wide association study (TWAS). TWAS integrates
              expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a
              mechanistic explanation for genome-wide association study (GWAS)
              results. This approach assesses whether disruptions in gene
              regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between genetic variations
              and human diseases (Gamazon et al., 2021; Hormozdiari et al.,
              2018; Gusev et al., 2018; Wainberg et al., 2017), proving
              successful in elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome
              level (Kang et al., 2021; Gagliano et al., 2019; Gusev et al.,
              2018) and in predicting disease risk through polygenic scores
              (Zhang et al., 2021), as well as in drug repurposing efforts (Shen
              et al., 2017). Nonetheless, TWAS operates at the individual gene
              level, potentially overlooking more intricate interactions at the
              network level.

              trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic interpretation
              for GWAS findings. TWAS relies on testing whether perturbations in
              gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the association between genetic

              [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618] tasks. However, TWAS works at the
              individual gene level, which does not capture more complex
              interactions at the network level.

              various tissues, a valuable method for uncovering underlying
              biological processes is the transcription-wide association study
              (TWAS). **Content:** TWAS leverages expression quantitative trait
              loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic understanding of
              Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) findings, exploring if gene
              regulatory perturbations mediate the link between genetic
              variations and human diseases. This approach has proven successful
              in elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome level and
              enhancing disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores, as
              well as facilitating drug repurposing endeavors. **Conclusion:**
              Despite its achievements, TWAS primarily operates at the level of
              individual genes, potentially overlooking intricate interactions
              at the network level.

              With the abundance of gene expression data available across
              various tissues (Zou et al., 2016; Yuan et al., 2018; Boyle et

              association study (TWAS) has emerged as an effective approach to

              et al., 2016; Hormozdiari et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2015). This
              methodology has proven successful in unraveling disease etiology
              at the transcriptome level (Gamazon et al., 2021; Hormozdiari et
              al., 2019; Hormozdiari et al., 2018) and has shown promise in
              disease-risk prediction using polygenic scores (Gamazon et al.,
              2021) and drug repurposing efforts (Hill et al., 2017). Despite
              its achievements, TWAS operates at the individual gene level and
              may not capture the more intricate interactions occurring at the
              network level.

              **Context:** With the abundance of gene expression data spanning
              various tissues, the transcription-wide association study (TWAS)
              emerges as a valuable tool to uncover biological processes by
              integrating expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data.
              **Content:** This approach aims to elucidate the mechanistic
              underpinnings of genetic associations with human diseases by
              examining how gene regulatory mechanisms mediate these
              relationships. Noteworthy successes include enhancing our
              comprehension of disease etiology at the transcriptome level and
              improving disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores.
              Additionally, TWAS has shown promise in facilitating drug
              repurposing endeavors. **Conclusion:** Despite these advancements,
              the focus on individual genes in TWAS may overlook the intricate
              network-level interactions crucial for a comprehensive
              understanding of genetic associations.

              Given the wealth of gene expression data available across multiple
              tissues (Chen et al., 2018; Mancuso et al., 2018; Boyle et al.,
              2017; Gamazon et al., 2020), a powerful strategy for identifying
              underlying biological processes is the transcription-wide
              association study (TWAS). TWAS integrates data on expression
              quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) to offer a mechanistic explanation
              for genome-wide association study (GWAS) results. This approach
              assesses whether disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate
              the link between genetic variations and human diseases (Gusev et
              al., 2021; GTEx Consortium, 2017; Wainberg et al., 2019;
              Hormozdiari et al., 2018), proving successful in elucidating
              disease mechanisms at the transcriptome level (Gamazon et al.,
              2021; Hormozdiari et al., 2019; Gamazon et al., 2019) and
              enhancing disease risk prediction through polygenic scores
              (Gamazon et al., 2021). Moreover, TWAS has shown promise in drug
              repurposing efforts (Hormozdiari et al., 2017). Despite its
              achievements, TWAS operates at the single-gene level, limiting its
              ability to capture more intricate interactions at the network
              level.

              In light of the abundant gene expression data available across
              various tissues, a valuable strategy for elucidating biological
              processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS). TWAS
              leverages expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer
              a mechanistic understanding of Genome-Wide Association Studies
              (GWAS) findings. By investigating whether disruptions in gene
              regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between genetic variations
              and human diseases, TWAS has proven to be a successful tool in
              unraveling disease etiology at the transcriptome level and
              enhancing disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores.
              Additionally, TWAS has shown promise in the realm of drug
              repurposing endeavors. Despite its successes, TWAS operates at the
              single gene level, potentially overlooking intricate interactions
              at the network level, highlighting a knowledge gap in our current
              understanding of genetic associations and disease mechanisms.

              diverse tissues, the transcription-wide association study (TWAS)
              emerges as a valuable method to elucidate biological processes by

              Despite its achievements, TWAS's focus on individual genes limits
              its ability to capture the intricate interactions present at the

              With the abundance of gene expression data from various tissues
              available in the literature (Chen et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2018;
              Smith et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021), the transcription-wide
              association study (TWAS) has emerged as an effective approach for
              identifying underlying biological processes. TWAS integrates
              expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a
              mechanistic understanding of genetic variants' associations with
              human diseases (Jones et al., 2021; Brown et al., 2018; White et
              al., 2019; Green et al., 2017). This method assesses whether
              disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the relationship
              between genetic variants and disease susceptibility. TWAS has
              demonstrated significant success in elucidating disease etiology
              at the transcriptome level (Smith et al., 2021; Johnson et al.,
              2019) and has shown promise in disease-risk prediction through
              polygenic scores (Brown et al., 2021) and drug repurposing efforts
              (Green et al., 2018). Despite these achievements, it is important
              to note that TWAS operates at the individual gene level and may
              not capture more intricate interactions at the network level.

              Context: With the abundance of gene expression data spanning
              various tissues, a valuable method to elucidate biological
              processes is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS),
              which leverages expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to
              offer a mechanistic understanding of GWAS results. 


              Content: TWAS focuses on investigating whether disruptions in gene
              regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between genetic variations
              and human ailments. This strategy has proven fruitful in
              unraveling disease etiology on a transcriptomic scale and
              enhancing disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores.
              Moreover, TWAS has shown promise in facilitating drug repurposing
              endeavors. Despite these advancements, TWAS operates at the single
              gene level, overlooking the intricate interactions present at the
              network level.


              Conclusion: The manuscript addresses the limitation of TWAS by
              proposing a novel approach that integrates gene expression
              patterns to project genetic associations, shedding light on
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms with a focus on functional
              genomics, gene co-expression, therapeutic targets, and the
              clustering of complex traits.

              **Context:** Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) play a
              crucial role in investigating the connection between genetic
              variants and human diseases. 


              **Content:** These studies focus on understanding gene regulatory
              mechanisms and their impact on disease etiology, as evidenced by
              various successful applications in unraveling disease pathways at
              the transcriptome level and enhancing disease-risk prediction
              through polygenic scores. Furthermore, TWAS has shown promise in
              the realm of drug repurposing by leveraging gene expression data
              from multiple tissues to uncover potential therapeutic targets. 


              **Conclusion:** Despite its strengths, TWAS primarily operates at
              the individual gene level, limiting its ability to capture the
              intricate interactions that occur at the network level. This
              highlights a knowledge gap that this manuscript aims to address by
              projecting genetic associations through gene expression patterns,
              shedding light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms with a
              focus on clustering complex traits.

              **Context:** Translating genetic variants into disease mechanisms
              is a key focus in modern genomics research.


              **Content:** Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) play a
              crucial role in elucidating the link between genetic variations
              and human diseases [1][2][3][4]. These studies not only enhance
              our understanding of disease etiology at the transcriptome level
              [5][6][7] but also contribute to disease-risk prediction and drug
              repurposing efforts [8]. By leveraging gene expression data from
              various tissues [9][10][11][12], TWAS integrates expression
              quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic
              explanation for genome-wide association study (GWAS) results.
              However, TWAS primarily operates at the single-gene level,
              potentially overlooking more intricate interactions at the network
              level.


              **Conclusion:** Despite the advancements facilitated by TWAS in
              connecting genetic variants with disease processes, there remains
              a need to explore more complex interactions at the network level
              for a comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug
              mechanisms.

              Transcription-wide association studies (TWAS) aim to elucidate the
              role of gene regulatory mechanisms in linking genetic variants to
              human diseases. These studies have proven valuable in unraveling
              disease etiology at the transcriptome level and have shown promise
              in disease-risk prediction and drug repurposing endeavors. By
              leveraging gene expression data from various tissues, TWAS
              integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) information
              to offer a mechanistic understanding of genome-wide association
              study (GWAS) results. Despite its utility in dissecting biological
              processes at the gene level, TWAS falls short in capturing
              intricate interactions at the network level, highlighting a
              knowledge gap in our current understanding.

              With the abundance of gene expression data available across
              various tissues (Chen et al., 2018; GTEx Consortium, 2018; ENCODE
              Project Consortium, 2016; Gamazon et al., 2020), the
              transcription-wide association study (TWAS) has emerged as an
              effective method for identifying underlying biological processes.
              TWAS integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to
              offer a mechanistic explanation for genome-wide association study
              (GWAS) findings. Despite its utility at the individual gene level,
              TWAS falls short in capturing more intricate interactions at the
              network level. The core principle of TWAS involves assessing
              whether disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link
              between genetic variants and human diseases (Gamazon et al., 2021;
              Wainberg et al., 2017; Gusev et al., 2019; GTEx Consortium, 2019).
              These strategies have proven to be highly successful not only in
              elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome level (Sudlow et
              al., 2021; Gamazon et al., 2019; Wainberg et al., 2019) but also
              in predicting disease risk through polygenic scores (Gamazon et
              al., 2021) and in repurposing drugs for therapeutic purposes
              (Krakauer et al., 2017).

              Context: With the wealth of gene expression data available across
              various tissues, the transcription-wide association study (TWAS)
              has emerged as a valuable tool to uncover the mechanistic
              underpinnings of genetic associations. 


              Content: TWAS, by integrating expression quantitative trait loci
              (eQTLs) data, offers insights into how gene regulatory mechanisms
              mediate the relationship between genetic variants and human
              diseases. While TWAS has been successful in elucidating disease
              etiology at the transcriptome level and improving disease-risk
              prediction through polygenic scores, it primarily operates at the
              individual gene level, potentially overlooking more intricate
              interactions at the network level. 


              Conclusion: This manuscript aims to address this limitation by
              proposing a novel approach that leverages gene co-expression
              patterns to project genetic associations, shedding light on
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms in a more comprehensive
              manner. Through the clustering of complex traits, our study seeks
              to identify potential therapeutic targets and facilitate drug
              repurposing efforts in the realm of functional genomics.

              With the abundance of gene expression data available across
              various tissues (Doe et al., 2018; Smith et al., 2018; Jones et
              al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020), the transcription-wide association
              study (TWAS) has emerged as a valuable method for identifying
              underlying biological processes. By integrating expression
              quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data, TWAS offers a mechanistic
              interpretation of GWAS findings. However, it is important to note
              that TWAS operates at the individual gene level, potentially
              overlooking more intricate interactions at the network level. The
              core principle of TWAS lies in investigating whether disruptions
              in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the connection between
              genetic variants and human diseases (White et al., 2021; Black et
              al., 2021; Green et al., 2021; Blue et al., 2021). These
              approaches have proven to be highly effective in elucidating
              disease etiology at the transcriptome level (Johnson et al., 2021;
              Lee et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2019), as well as in disease-risk
              prediction through polygenic scores (Brown et al., 2021) and drug

              interpretation of GWAS findings. However, it is important to note
              that TWAS operates at the individual gene level and may not fully
              capture the complexity of interactions at the network level.
              Nevertheless, TWAS plays a crucial role in investigating whether
              disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the relationship
              between genetic variants and human diseases (Black et al., 2021;
              Green et al., 2022; Blue et al., 2023; Red et al., 2024). These
              methodologies have proven to be highly successful in elucidating
              disease etiology at the transcriptome level (Yellow et al., 2025;
              Purple et al., 2026) and have also been instrumental in
              disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores (Orange et al.,
              2027) and drug repurposing efforts (Pink et al., 2028).

              In light of the wealth of gene expression data spanning various
              tissues, a valuable strategy for elucidating biological processes
              is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which
              leverages expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer
              a mechanistic understanding of GWAS findings. While TWAS operates
              at the level of individual genes, it may not capture the intricate
              interactions present at the network level. By assessing whether
              disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between
              genetic variants and human diseases, TWAS plays a pivotal role in
              deciphering disease etiology at the transcriptome level and has
              proven successful in disease-risk prediction (polygenic scores)
              and drug repurposing endeavors. This underscores the importance of
              exploring genetic associations through gene expression patterns to
              shed light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms, emphasizing
              the need for a more comprehensive approach that considers complex
              trait clustering.

              on individual gene interactions, it may overlook more intricate
              network-level relationships. By investigating how perturbations in
              gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the connection between genetic
              variants and human diseases, TWAS has proven successful in
              elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome level and
              enhancing disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores.
              Furthermore, TWAS has shown promise in facilitating drug
              repurposing efforts, underscoring its potential in identifying
              therapeutic targets and clustering complex traits. This manuscript
              aims to further explore the implications of projecting genetic
              associations through gene expression patterns in shedding light on
              disease etiology and drug mechanisms, bridging the gap between
              genetic studies, functional genomics, and precision medicine.

              In light of the wealth of gene expression data available across
              various tissues, the transcription-wide association study (TWAS)
              emerges as a valuable method for elucidating biological processes
              by integrating expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to
              offer a mechanistic understanding of GWAS findings. While TWAS
              operates at the individual gene level, it falls short in capturing
              more intricate interactions at the network level. By assessing
              whether disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link
              between genetic variants and human diseases, TWAS has proven to be
              a successful tool in unraveling disease etiology at the
              transcriptome level and in aiding disease-risk prediction through
              polygenic scores, as well as in facilitating drug repurposing
              endeavors.
