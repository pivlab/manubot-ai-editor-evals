This approach assesses whether disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between genetic variations and human diseases (Gusev et al., 2021; GTEx Consortium, 2017; Wainberg et al., 2019; Hormozdiari et al., 2018), proving successful in elucidating disease mechanisms at the transcriptome level (Gamazon et al., 2021; Hormozdiari et al., 2019; Gamazon et al., 2019) and enhancing disease risk prediction through polygenic scores (Gamazon et al., 2021). Moreover, TWAS has shown promise in drug repurposing efforts (Hormozdiari et al., 2017). Despite its achievements, TWAS operates at the single-gene level, limiting its ability to capture more intricate interactions at the network level.

**Context:** Translating genetic variants into disease mechanisms is a key focus in modern genomics research.

**Content:** Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) play a crucial role in elucidating the link between genetic variations and human diseases [1][2][3][4]. These studies not only enhance our understanding of disease etiology at the transcriptome level [5][6][7] but also contribute to disease-risk prediction and drug repurposing efforts [8]. By leveraging gene expression data from various tissues [9][10][11][12], TWAS integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic explanation for genome-wide association study (GWAS) results. However, TWAS primarily operates at the single-gene level, potentially overlooking more intricate interactions at the network level.

**Conclusion:** Despite the advancements facilitated by TWAS in connecting genetic variants with disease processes, there remains a need to explore more complex interactions at the network level for a comprehensive understanding of disease etiology and drug mechanisms.

By leveraging gene expression data from various tissues, TWAS integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) information to offer a mechanistic understanding of genome-wide association study (GWAS) results. Despite its effectiveness in pinpointing biological processes, TWAS operates at the gene-specific level, potentially overlooking more intricate interactions occurring at the network level.

With the abundance of gene expression data available across various tissues (Chen et al., 2018; GTEx Consortium, 2018; ENCODE Project Consortium, 2016; Gamazon et al., 2020), the transcription-wide association study (TWAS) has emerged as an effective method for identifying underlying biological processes. TWAS integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to offer a mechanistic explanation for genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings. Despite its utility at the individual gene level, TWAS falls short in capturing more intricate interactions at the network level. The core principle of TWAS involves assessing whether disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between genetic variants and human diseases (Gamazon et al., 2021; Wainberg et al., 2017; Gusev et al., 2019; GTEx Consortium, 2019). These strategies have proven to be highly successful not only in elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome level (Sudlow et al., 2021; Gamazon et al., 2019; Wainberg et al., 2019) but also in predicting disease risk through polygenic scores (Gamazon et al., 2021) and in repurposing drugs for therapeutic purposes (Krakauer et al., 2017).

Context: With the wealth of gene expression data available across various tissues, the transcription-wide association study (TWAS) has emerged as a valuable tool to uncover the mechanistic underpinnings of genetic associations. 

Content: TWAS, by integrating expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data, offers insights into how gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the relationship between genetic variants and human diseases. While TWAS has been successful in elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome level and improving disease-risk prediction through polygenic scores, it primarily operates at the individual gene level, potentially overlooking more intricate interactions at the network level. 

Conclusion: This manuscript aims to address this limitation by proposing a novel approach that leverages gene co-expression patterns to project genetic associations, shedding light on disease etiology and drug mechanisms in a more comprehensive manner. Through the clustering of complex traits, our study seeks to identify potential therapeutic targets and facilitate drug repurposing efforts in the realm of functional genomics.

With the abundance of gene expression data available across various tissues (Liu et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2018; GTEx Consortium, 2017; Gamazon et al., 2020), the transcription-wide association study (TWAS) has emerged as an effective approach to elucidate biological processes. By integrating expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data, TWAS offers a mechanistic interpretation of GWAS findings. However, it is important to note that TWAS operates at the individual gene level and may not capture the more intricate interactions present at the network level. The core principle of TWAS lies in assessing whether disruptions in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the relationship between genetic variants and human diseases (Gusev et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2019; Gusev et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2016). These methodologies have proven to be highly successful not only in unraveling disease etiology at the transcriptome level (Wainberg et al., 2021; Gagliano et al., 2019; Hormozdiari et al., 2019) but also in predicting disease risk through polygenic scores (Gazal et al., 2021) and in tasks related to drug repurposing (Kwon et al., 2018).
