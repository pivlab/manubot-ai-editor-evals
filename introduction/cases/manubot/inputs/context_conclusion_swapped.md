These and other features support an open collaborative writing process that is not feasible with other writing platforms. When text is changed, Manubot automatically updates the manuscriptâ€™s webpage so that all authors can read and edit from the latest version. Because manuscripts are created from GitHub repositories, Manubot supports a workflow where all edits are reviewed and discussed, ensuring that the collaborative text has a cohesive style and message and that authors receive precise credit for their work. Manubot supports citations by adding a persistent identifier like a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) or PubMed Identifier (PMID) directly in the text so that large groups of authors do not have to coordinate reference lists.
