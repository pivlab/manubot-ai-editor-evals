This development has decreased the barriers to making science open, while supporting new massively collaborative models of research. However, the scientific community requires tools whose workflows encourage openness. Manuscripts are the cornerstone of scholarly communication, but drafting and publishing manuscripts has traditionally relied on proprietary or offline tools that do not support open scholarly writing, in which anyone is able to contribute and the contribution history is preserved and public. We introduce Manubot, a new tool and infrastructure for authoring scholarly manuscripts in the open, and report how it was instrumental for the collaborative project that led to its creation.
