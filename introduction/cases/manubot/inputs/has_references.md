The internet enables science to be shared in real-time at a low cost to a global audience.
This development has decreased the barriers to making science open, while supporting new massively collaborative models of research [@doi:10.1515/9781400839452].
However, the scientific community requires tools whose workflows encourage openness [@doi:10.17226/25116].
Manuscripts are the cornerstone of scholarly communication, but drafting and publishing manuscripts has traditionally relied on proprietary or offline tools that do not support _open scholarly writing_, in which anyone is able to contribute and the contribution history is preserved and public.
We introduce [Manubot](https://manubot.org), a new tool and infrastructure for authoring scholarly manuscripts in the open, and report how it was instrumental for the collaborative project that led to its creation.
